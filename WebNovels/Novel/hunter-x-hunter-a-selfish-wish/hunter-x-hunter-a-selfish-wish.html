      <h2>Capítulo 1: -</h2>
      <p>
        Dying is a new feeling of anger for me I was about to go to college for
        engineering with a scholarship I had it all planned out for college I
        was going to make some connections there knowing some people getting the
        best grades and using those people that I made connections with to get a
        good job and then I will plan to go higher and higher until I touched
        the sky I had plans to get rich quick I even had a family the family
        that gave up a lot for me they needed me and I just had to go and die
        damn it damn it damn it then I feel something weird and look around the
        void and I turn around and see an eye as gigantic as a mountain I I am
        not going to lie I am scared I just kept walking backward away from it
        as fast and as stealthily as I can then as I am doing so I keep looking
        at The Darkness thing with just an eye and I see a gigantic mouth open I
        can't even see its end jet rows and rows of sharp teeth a lot of tongues
        come out of the mouth and towards me this is terrifying as I think this
        I immediately turn around and run in darkness or whatever I don't even
        look at what I am stepping in I keep running and running and running I
        don't know how long I have been running but I see a circle made of light
        about my size in front of me so I directly jump into it and then I lose
        consciousness the next time I wake up I see a bright light in front of
        my face and hear someone or something say it's a boy M Miller I suddenly
        feel someone grabbing me my baby my baby boy ah I get it now after I
        hear that I immediately start crying as I have assessed the situation I
        hear someone with a hard manly voice say my son my son are you okay
        honey then the voice I hear the womanly voice from before talking in an
        ushered tone answer yes just stop screaming you are making the baby cry
        just like this 6 months pass after being here for such a Time life is
        really boring I was born in do Harbor in 1969 I don't know where I am
        but I am in the past Sue that means a lot of money making opportunities
        waiting for me I am about to overuse my future knowledge as much as I
        can by the way my name is Jax Miller and my parents names are Jerry
        Miller 41 years old black hair and eyes and good looking man that works
        in a loan bank Beth Miller 28 years old brown hair and brown eyes with a
        pretty face yeah I know quite the age difference there and there is me I
        seem like I am going to be good-looking with black hair and brown eyes
        with a baby face I don't know to me babies just look almost all the same
        finally I reached the age of one-year-old and okay okay Red Alert I just
        heard father say something bizarre he was talking to me about hunters at
        first I didn't think anything special but he said that when he was
        younger he wanted to be a hunter or whatever I was only half listening
        but when I asked about specifically why he wanted to be a hunter when he
        earns more money and easier as a lone man I asked him in gibberish baby
        talk obviously but then he started explaining Hunter adventures and
        stories types of them like Blacklist Hunters Gourmet Hunters Etc I
        almost went full panic mode but I pushed it at the back of my mind and
        forced myself to calm down then as soon as night time came I went into
        bed and I started practicing meditation well then an extreme change of
        plans must come about I must meditate to start my training now I am in
