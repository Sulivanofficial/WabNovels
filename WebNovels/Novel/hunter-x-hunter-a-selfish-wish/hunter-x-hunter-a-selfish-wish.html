        <h2>Capítulo 1: -</h2>
        <p>
          Dying is a new feeling of anger for me I was about to go to college
          for engineering with a scholarship I had it all planned out for
          college I was going to make some connections there knowing some people
          getting the best grades and using those people that I made connections
          with to get a good job and then I will plan to go higher and higher
          until I touched the sky I had plans to get rich quick I even had a
          family the family that gave up a lot for me they needed me and I just
          had to go and die damn it damn it damn it then I feel something weird
          and look around the void and I turn around and see an eye as gigantic
          as a mountain I I am not going to lie I am scared I just kept walking
          backward away from it as fast and as stealthily as I can then as I am
          doing so I keep looking at The Darkness thing with just an eye and I
          see a gigantic mouth open I can't even see its end jet rows and rows
          of sharp teeth a lot of tongues come out of the mouth and towards me
          this is terrifying as I think this I immediately turn around and run
          in darkness or whatever I don't even look at what I am stepping in I
          keep running and running and running I don't know how long I have been
          running but I see a circle made of light about my size in front of me
          so I directly jump into it and then I lose consciousness the next time
          I wake up I see a bright light in front of my face and hear someone or
          something say it's a boy M Miller I suddenly feel someone grabbing me
          my baby my baby boy ah I get it now after I hear that I immediately
          start crying as I have assessed the situation I hear someone with a
          hard manly voice say my son my son are you okay honey then the voice I
          hear the womanly voice from before talking in an ushered tone answer
          yes just stop screaming you are making the baby cry just like this 6
          months pass after being here for such a Time life is really boring I
          was born in do Harbor in 1969 I don't know where I am but I am in the
          past Sue that means a lot of money making opportunities waiting for me
          I am about to overuse my future knowledge as much as I can by the way
          my name is Jax Miller and my parents names are Jerry Miller 41 years
          old black hair and eyes and good looking man that works in a loan bank
          Beth Miller 28 years old brown hair and brown eyes with a pretty face
          yeah I know quite the age difference there and there is me I seem like
          I am going to be good-looking with black hair and brown eyes with a
          baby face I don't know to me babies just look almost all the same
          finally I reached the age of one-year-old and okay okay Red Alert I
          just heard father say something bizarre he was talking to me about
          hunters at first I didn't think anything special but he said that when
          he was younger he wanted to be a hunter or whatever I was only half
          listening but when I asked about specifically why he wanted to be a
          hunter when he earns more money and easier as a lone man I asked him
          in gibberish baby talk obviously but then he started explaining Hunter
          adventures and stories types of them like Blacklist Hunters Gourmet
          Hunters Etc I almost went full panic mode but I pushed it at the back
          of my mind and forced myself to calm down then as soon as night time
          came I went into bed and I started practicing meditation well then an
          extreme change of plans must come about I must meditate to start my
          training now I am in the world of Hunter x Hunter then as I reached 2
          years old I already started preparing for the future the main thing I
          need is access to N I keep meditating but I still haven't awakened it
          yet I am kind of disappointed that I don't have the kind of talent the
          MC's do but I still keep trying not giving up after all I have
          patience because I am born way before the main characters I now
          started to run around do Harbor to get to know things around but
          mainly for me to exercise my body of course I don't go into Shady easy
          to get kidnapped alleys and areas I always run during daylight and
          when there is at least a dozen people around finally as I am at the
          age of three I have had some success in nen yes I did it I got my nen
          I feel the warm mucus feeling around me then I am even able to
          naturally close my nodes from leaking any Aura until I can cover
          myself in it and not let any go away as another year passes I notice
          something strange it seems like I have nowhere near the talent of Gan
          and kilowa I still need to keep training my 10 are the hard work I
          have to put through just because I don't have the talent well then
          anyway I now have control over 10 and I still keep training my body I
          now even go and help the people around carrying their stuff and keep
          acting like a kid I am thinking after getting a bit stronger I will
          run away from home and go train somewhere I won't really miss my new
          parents I was never really connect with them after all I did possess
          their baby I mean if I didn't do so then how was I able to use nen
          with my average soul from my past life and if they knew they would
          definitely not react nicely but I don't blame them for it either and
          I'm even a little grateful to them for creating my new body even so
          the only people I will ever truly love are my family in my last world
          but at least they are safe in that one I also learned how to read and
          started convincing my father to buy me medical books I gave him a
          reason because I want to become a doctor to save people he reluctantly
          did so at the age of five I am finally able to train other basic nin
          techniques I have now started training zetsu to suppress my aura to
          hide from other nin users I still train my body now that I am ready to
          find out my category of nen I didn't try it sooner because it would
          have been useless to me with my talent it would have only got me
          distracted I am in my room and ready to do so I put down a glass of
          water with a leaf on top and I then run some in through it that is
          when chapter 2 The Leaf started rotating a little ah I see so I am a
          manipulator well that is quite good it's not that bad of an N category
          because every one of them has their uniqueness and strengths ulator
          what can I do with that whom I have a basic idea on my hatsu but it
          would take my lifespan to get it completed because of my lack of
          Talent OR AA size anyway instead of wasting my lifespan I will just
          try to train to my maximum capacity and that will be when I create my
          hatsu special ability it wouldn't take much of my lifespan or none at
          all I will wait until I am 20 then I will create my hatsu I will have
          plenty of power and then amount by then I hope plus with 10 slowing
          down aging but not slowing down growth I think I will be okay then but
          I really don't want to waste lifespan on this ability after all I am
          not like a selfless shown and character that will sacrifice things
          like this but the time until I create my ability will help me think of
          some more things to add to it or maybe put some conditions on it to
          make it easier to create and stronger as I grow at the age of six I
          notice that my body is getting stronger I have started going to the
          wild to train after I learned Reen to enhance my physical ability well
          not really the wild just the forests outside the city I am still
          studying the basics of nen I have also started studying some simple
          medical books after all I am going to become a doctor in this world
          and then take the hunter exam I have some big plans after my hunter
          exam as another year flows by I still am just training the basic n
          techniques and my body I am going to school now I usually just train
          zetsu in school and other techniques at other times at least this time
          school is easy I also made a lot of friends that do things for me
          mostly a smart student I make him do my homework after all I already
          know these things that we are learning so it's just a waste of time I
          keep studying medicines and training my body in the wild after all
          there are a lot of ways to be strong in this world even without nen
          there exist people like a snake charmer or even someone who knows
          assassination techniques n doesn't necessarily diminish this
          uniqueness it actually makes it even more complicated also I have been
          reading some animal books to learn about some animals in this world
          then that gave me an idea I have started killing some wild animals
          without my parents knowing and selling them in the harbor to buyers of
          course I was disguised in a cloak I earned a lot of money like this
          about 100 Jenny which is around 100 of course this was not won by just
          selling animals earnestly it was by selling RAR looking animals which
          were not rare to stupid buyers and always coming only once a month at
          different intervals to sell people fake animals and come the other
          times in another disguise to sell normal animals that I catch in a day
          at the age of eight I have stopped selling fake animals because
          someone might come after me so this year I won only 40 Jenny I have
          also spent 10 00 buying four medical books I needed I have also been
          telling my mother that I have been sleeping in one of my friend's
          houses and having a sleepover when in reality I am sleeping in the
          forest with a rope on a branch tied to a rock on one side and in the
          other is me holding it with my hand while sleeping this is an exercise
          from the anime so I am trying to learn it well I learned that pretty
          fast so I didn't have to tell my parents new excuses why I am not
          sleeping at home I skipped some grades also when I told my parents
          school is too easy boring and not a challenge and I want to skip it I
          have been training my body a lot my strength especially by Rolling a
          lot of rocks that are up to my knee I would try for more but I really
          don't want to hurt my young body yet I even started learning gyo which
          is putting men towards my eyes to see n better and see things hidden
          with i in it was quite hard learning and keeping my in concentrated on
          my eyes but hey at least I can now use it I still keep training the
          basics a damn it why don't I have talent like Gan or kilua I would
          have already been strong if I had that by the way I need to think of a
          way to make more money now that I have gyo there could be a way to
          earn money age 9 years old I still keep practicing the basic n
          abilities and goo which I can now use sparingly M my talent is sht
          it's not even funny at how average it is if I was born in the same
          generation as the MC's I would just go to a quiet place far from the
          conflict and stay in isolation until I get my n mastered which by then
          I wouldn't even know what happened I now keep pushing Boulders as big
          as my childish body I keep going towards the market to find anything
          good but all I find is trash nothing with nen in it I even quit
          hunting it's just a waste of time for way to little amount of money at
          the age of 10 my body has gotten more robust and muscular even when I
          am so young now they I am doing pull-ups with rope tied to my feet
          with a small Boulder tied on the other side I do push-ups with
          Boulders half as big as me on my back I still train the basics and go
          a lot you know this is getting kind of annoying when I remember how
          the MC got it so easily gyo is getting better I am now able to keep it
          up kind of stable for about 1 minute did I already complain today
          about my super average talent I keep studying medicine and I skipped a
          bunch of grades and went directly to high school people around town
          know me as a helpful and genius young man and my parents are really
          proud of me I don't really care about any of that I just want to train
          my Men chapter 3 as I become 15 years old I noticed that I have gotten
          quite stronger since last time normal people can no longer be compared
          to me I have trained my body quite harshly my n amount is now larger
          than before I haven't seen any Hunters around to compare it to in the
          next years to come I am going to keep a lookout for them I am now in
          University studying medicine away from my hometown I am known quite a
          bit in this field and am known by some important people even though I
          keep training men I have started to feel the limit of my talent it's
          getting harder and harder to get stronger I would need years and years
          to progress even a bit I look at my hands and I make them into a fist
          I just need to wait five more years to get everything in order for me
          to make my hatsu I have everything about my ability figured out but I
          need to be a little stronger to not use lifespan and have less
          conditions on it just like this 3 years pass and I am 18 years old now
          I still study in this University after all medical knowledge has
          become more of a side project I have been studying and trying to
          figure the best method on how to train my body as I was currently
          reading on the library after I finished some body training I was tired
          so I decided to rest here and read while doing so I then hear a
          professor that teaches about diseases and viruses talking with someone
          else and walking towards me I then give a side glance towards him and
          then my eyes widen immediately he is not even in my radar anymore what
          I am concentrated on is the person next to him she is a bespectacled
          woman of average height with seafoam green hair haircut at medium
          length she wears a headdress that has a pair of doglike ears a
          conservative knee length white dress and a white caplet with a cross
          at the front of the neck her upper jaw and nose also look like those
          of a dog she is a younger Cheeto yure the woman who will become the
          future chairman of the hunter Association then as they are walking
          towards me the teacher points at me and says in a proud voice he is
          our brightest student his name is Jax Miller he has been here since he
          was 15 he is truly amazing he is smart and a hard worker then they are
          in front of my table I look towards them then the teacher Smiles
          towards me and says Jax this is a disease Hunter and a famous one at
          that her name is cheel Yorkshire I look at her with a neutral face
          trying to keep my thoughts unreadable also it wouldn't be smart to lie
          or act in front of her because she will definitely be able to tell
          even though she is younger now she was able to tell when one of the
          most scheming people in Hunter x Hunter is not telling the truth she
          just looks at me she smiles a little and she says hey there my name is
          Cheeto Yorkshire have you ever thought of taking the hunter exam I can
          see that you are special I just look towards her and am about to say
          something but I am interrupted by the teacher who in a panicked voice
          says no no Miss Yorkshire Jax is a good student and is going to likely
          be a miraculous doctor but I have heard that the hunter exam is
          physically taxing and I don't think that he is ready or suited for it
          she just looks at him and says in a mysterious tone I think that he is
          stronger than you give him credit for professor she is right I still
          keep training myself extensively every day then she completely ignores
          my professor as she keeps staring at me intensely that is when I
          decide to say to her in a normal voice sa yes I have thought about it
          but I am not ready yet I am first thinking of finishing medical school
          getting some medical experience then I will become a hunter she just
          looks at me turns around and starts walking away while but not before
          she says okay then I will be waiting for you to become a hunter notify
          me when you do become one I could teach you more about your uniqueness
          I can immediately guess what she is thinking she probably thought I
          was an N genius they are those that use nen unconsciously she probably
          didn't take me as her student and teach me nin immediately because she
          probably wants to follow the rules to keep nin hidden she probably
          also thinks that nen might distract me from my medical studies and she
          thought that she might be able to entice me to take the hunter exam
          earlier for me to learn about my uniqueness I already know about men
          and no way am I learning from someone who can tell when I am lying or
          not I need to disappear for a little then I will apply for graduation
          immediately I don't want her following me even 2 years later at the
          age of 20 I still think about my meeting with her but that isn't so
          important anymore I look at the trees around me and I can't help but
          reminisce a little after that meeting with cheel I graduated that year
          and went to the heavens Arena I got until the 199th floor got the
          money I won and left immediately I won 20000 Jenny I also did some
          procedures to raise my poison and electricity immunity it was very
          painful and harsh but I know I will need it my resistance is still not
          at zoric Family level but if they had a 10 resistance I have around
          seven I also know that the guide for this year's Hunter exam is in
          zaban city which is close to D Harbor I also now have a way to compare
          my strength now that I have seen some fights from the 200th floor I
          would have competed to become floor master and I might have been able
          to become one with some luck and by crushing some beginners in the
          200th floor but if I met any strong Freaks Like Hoka I would be
          crippled or dead now that I am back in my hometown to make M inability
          I think back on my struggles if I trained another 10 to 15 years I
          would be a lot stronger than this and I might reach my absolute limit
          by then but I don't have time like that in 10 years Canon will start
          and the only Advanced men technique I know is gyo because I am just
          going to be wasting time if I try to learn the others with my talent I
          can hold Reen active for one hour Gan and kilua could do it for 3
          hours with only a minuscule amount of training compared to me Not only
          would it be hard and time consuming knowing those abilities won't even
          help me create my hatsu ability then I go into the forest and use my
          aren a gentle white Rippling Aura comes out I then put my hand forward
          facing the sky and think about my ability and say to myself myen
          expend yourself and give the ability chapter 4 flash minin
          concentrates in my hand as if it is all being sucked into it like
          there is a whirlpool on the palm of my hand slowly Min enformed into a
          square type and a normal looking tablet appears on my hand I
          immediately stop my Reen and go to 10 which stops my aura from leaking
          away I keep this always active to slow down my aging I look at the
          reflective screen okay the tablet contrary to my real age I have a
          face that looks like a 16-year-old but I am taller than the average
          one I'm 185 M 61 with black hair and brown eyes with a good-look face
          and a pair of glasses I don't really need the glasses but it puts my
          opponents off guard sometimes and they think I don't have a strong
          body I mean it's not that big of an advantage but I will get whatever
          I can I think of my hatsu that was thankfully created hatsu gamer Body
          Soul control an ability to grow physical stats then amount and then
          Talent with exp from killing living organisms the stronger the
          organism the more exsp I get physical abilities do not degrade from
          not training condition one the organisms must have their n open or be
          at least as strong as the average Hunter physically to get exp from
          them two can't take exp from an organism that is killed by someone
          else three after you kill them you must touch their body with your
          right hand while having the tablet in the other hand then the body
          will become Sparkles of light and enter the tablet to become exp four
          after I upgrade my nen amount or talent in my status page I can't use
          nen for one day five phys physical training gives exp directly to the
          stat that is being trained until it gets to the next level it won't
          get a rise in power no matter even if the stat is 1 exp away from
          leveling up X LVL 44950 exp it will still be the same power as being
          only Z exp in that level X LVL 450 exp that is my hatsu finally
          haahaha I immediately have to force myself to calm down and look at my
          tablet there is only one app in it called status and I click on it and
          I see my attributes Jax Miller age 20 Talent 50100 exp exp zero St LVL
          5 4,100 exp AG LVL 52100 exp n LVL 5 9,100 exp n Mount LVL 542 ,100
          exp the status represent with LVL of certain stats stats are ranked
          like this LVL power one normal baby two normal teen three normal adult
          four trained human five normal men user Hunter six strong men user
          strong Hunter seven Phantom troop n user eight cwlo zoric level nine
          Royal Guard level 10 King level marum that is just a general way of
          ranking stats aren't everything for example just because a phantom
          troop member has stats lower or higher than level seven doesn't matter
          what is used to calculate this is that they have one Stat or maybe two
          stats at level seven and the others one number lower or even two
          numbers if they have a rare hatsu for example yuin probably has seven
          strength seven endurance and six agility while feton has six strength
          six endurance and he has seven agility but of course battles aren't
          dependent completely on stats I think feton would defeat yagin in
          battle because of his special ability which is the more he is hurt the
          more heat produces his Rising Sun ability well anyways the most
          important part of my ability is the ability to raise Talent also if I
          raise talent I will become more talented not in Just In N but in other
          things like cooking driving Etc obviously normal people have talent in
          some things and no talent in other things but my talent is universal
          of course no matter how talented you are you need some foundational
          knowledge on the subject mine is at five which is average I have made
          the level 10 of talent be like gon's Talent of nen I believe moram had
          more than 10 in Talent especially with his devour type special nen
          ability also no manipulators will be able to control me because for
          manipulators it's the early bird gets the worm though technically I am
          already controlled by my own ability so it won't work I am also
          planning on taking the hunter exam this year I kept looking around the
          forest to make sure no one came here when I was doing my hatsu special
          ability creation after making sure I immediately take out my phone and
          call someone crying then a voice which I can't even tell the gender of
          comes through the line who are you when I hear this I just calmly
          answer hey Zed I need some info then the voice comes back more clearly
          this time and it is easily identified as a man and he says sure man
          what do you need I just ask him in a calm voice when and where is the
          hunter exam I hear him ruffle through something and then say sure man
          just he then starts explaining the info and giving me all the details
          that I need to know even some passwords Etc Zed is a guy I met during
          my stay in Heaven's Arena he is an information broker but he doesn't
          have nen but he is good at getting information anyway after some time
          I end the call and wire him a million Jenny well then time to take the
          hunter exam my journey finally starts chapter 5 2 days later after
          creating my hatsu I left my hometown and I am currently outside of a
          huge skyscraper to the public this is a famous building of a real
          estate businessman he is a hunter too so it makes sense that his
          building is being being used as an entry to the hunter exam I am
          currently wearing a black suit with hidden blades inside it even a gun
          and I also have a black briefcase in my hand and I am also wearing my
          usual fake glasses I have my black hair covering my forehead and
          giving off a friendly Vibe when I go inside I notice people in
          business suits going about their business I see the receptionist and I
          immediately go towards her when she sees me approaching her she just
          looks at me and smiles while saying in a happy voice what can I help
          you with sir damn she seems genuinely happy to see me what a good
          actress even I can't seem to pinpoint her act I just smile towards her
          and say in a friendly voice with a small friendly smile on my face I
          would like the room in the back her expression doesn't change at all
          and still with a smile on her face she says oh sir that would be on
          floor 35 room number 17A I just nod and go towards the elev elevator
          when I see that it reads out of order H has the test already started
          well that is no big deal I am already prepared I just turn around and
          go towards the staircase and start going up the stairs after 10 floors
          I finally see some people who probably came before me they are resting
          most of them have backpacks and seem like they are ready to live in
          the wilderness I keep walking and walking I see more and more people
          on the side resting as I am counting floors when I arrive at the 31st
          floor I see a huge crowd of people in here and trying to get into a
          room which has a sign with 17A written on it as soon as I saw this I
          couldn't help but think that they have been tricked the receptionist
          said on floor 35 so that must mean that this is a fake then as not to
          alarm anyone I use zetsu and dull my presence to not let anyone notice
          me less people means less competition after all then I go up to the
          35th floor and I start walking along the hallway until I arrive at a
          door labeled as 17A and I enter it there I see that it is like a giant
          classroom with around 170 people in it there also seemed to be some
          people sitting on chairs in the sides of the classroom they had
          notebooks in their hands I look around and don't see anyone from the
          hxh Cannon story seeing that I just find an empty desk and sit on it
          after 3 hours a guy with a bandan dark trench coat and a scar along
          his face comes in and he immediately says in a harsh cold voice I
          wonder how many of you will die this time as he says that he has an
          annoyed look on his face after some awkward silence a muscular bald
          guy who is sitting in the front gets up and walks in front of the
          scared Hunter he snear at him and says I have been here for 5 hours
          and I am honestly tired how about me and you fight right now and get
          this over with I get a hunter's license and you get the beating you
          deserve I will allow you to decide the rules of the fight the exam
          Proctor just looks at him the annoyed look on his face is gone and I
          could see his n leak out expressing his anger the muscular guy in
          front of him immediately falls to his knees the Proctor doesn't say
          anything as he takes out a knife and says Okay I accept your challenge
          and I choose a death match and with a clean and elegant motion flash
          he decapitates the bald muscular exam participant after killing the
          muscular man casually tells one of the guys with the notebook to take
          the body out and throw it onto the garbage disposal some of the
          contestants pale the exam Proctor just turns around like nothing
          happened and he says well then let me explain this exam he just starts
          explaining the exam as if nothing really even happened it is pretty
          much a written exam and if you are caught cheating you will be
          eliminated so you must complete the exam which consists of 10
          questions during the allocated time also the 10th question will be
          given during the last 10 minutes after the exam Proctor explained it
          he had the notebook guys give us the exam papers when I look at my
          exam paper quite easy I finished it in 15 minutes the time that I have
          left is 45 minutes seeing that I have nothing to do I secretly use gyo
          to concentrate nen into my eyes and see if there is any hidden n user
          around I found two nen users who were trying to hide by allowing their
          n to flow like a regular human also there are two others a blonde
          female and male they are sitting next to each other so I will assume
          the worst case scenario that they are together the guy also has some
          type of war paint into his face I will need to be careful there are
          four men users during this Hunter exam after all that is finished we
          are asked if we want to take the 10th question also some people got
          caught cheating and were escorted outside they didn't dare reject they
          already saw what happened to someone who tried to go against the exam
          Proctor if we do take it and don't answer it correctly then we will
          fail and will never be able to take it again some people do give up
          pathetic pieces of sht they came this far and they still can't see
          underneath that statement at the end there are only 97 people left
          then the exam Proctor just adjusts his bandana a little and
          nonchalantly says there was no other question you all pass they were
          just scaredy cat cats that didn't deserve to even be here then he
          starts going towards the door and says follow me to the rooftop there
          we will meet our transportation vehicle for the next part of the exam
          after some time and me following him to the 100th floor and then the
          rooftop some more people fell during the journey and now there are
          only 75 participants left when we arrive at the rooftop the exam
          Proctor says in a casual voice they should be here anytime now Sue
          goodbye it hasn't been a pleasure meeting you he then goes to the roof
          elevator he pressed the button and an out of order sign showed up then
          as if remembering something he takes a card out of his trench coat the
          card has the hunter Association logo in it he just swipes it in the
          front of the elevator and ping the elevator door opens so it really
          was working all along huh I wonder if some poor fool just walked all
          this way without somehow even realizing chapter 6 then after a couple
          of minutes I see a giant blimp appear from the sky and soon I see
          someone jump from the sky towards the ground Flash and it opens a
          parachute the person who lands on the ground is a woman who looks
          around her 20s she has light brown pupiless eyes her hair color is
          violet and it is styled in a short spiky fann ponytail she is wearing
          a fitted mesh bodysuit that covers her from her neck down to her
          thighs over this she is also wearing a tan Overcoat with a purple
          inseam and a pocket on each side a dark orange miniskirt with a dark
          blue belt she also has some good SE cups on her she then Smiles
          brightly towards our group and cheerfully says hey there I am Kona and
          I will be your next exam Proctor I am sure that you are all hungry I
          am not as cruel as the emo Scarface so I have prepared a lot of food
          on the blimp so you guys can rest and relax the next exam will start
          after 2 days the people around me seem to physically relax and somehow
          trust the woman in front of us they must be glad that she is not like
          the Proctor before her who killed an exam participant just because he
          dared to raise his voice but looks can be deceiving after getting on
          the blimp and looking at the food I secretly test the food with a thin
          needle for any corrosive type poison at after doing that test then I
          started eating like everyone else I finally finish eating and start
          going outside I look at the paper that was given to us when we entered
          here it separates our sleeping quarters there are five living quarters
          I just look at the map and go towards the bar on the Airship when I
          arrive there I see that only a couple of participants are drinking how
          dumb are they to drink in a ship full of people who are ready to kill
          you then I also notice our exam Proctor who is talking with the
          bartender who is a person in a suit with lavender hair that curls at
          the end his most distinctive feature is his lack of mouth isn't he the
          exam Proctor during the time gone took his Hunter's exam I decide to
          go towards them as soon as I do so they stop talking and look towards
          me I sit next to my exam Proctor then I look at the bartender and
          smile towards him while saying can I have a shot of whiskey he just
          nods and goes to prepare some drinks with no questions asked then my
          exam proor Kona looks at me with an amused smile and says you sure are
          a rude guy aren't you coming in here and interrupting our conversation
          like that even when she says that I act cly and calmly put my
          briefcase on the table I then look towards her smile and say in a
          friendly tone ah sorry if I did that it's just that all of these
          strong people in here make me nervous she just gives me a questioning
          look and says with a smirk on her face the most most dangerous
          contestant during this time is you I just raise an eyebrow at her but
          I just ignore her and say to her in a friendly voice Sue I have a
          question then she just goes back to drinking from her glass then satat
          brings me my drinks and goes back to washing some glasses Kona just
          shrugs her shoulders and says sure ask away I don't even touch my
          drink that Sadat brought me my face becomes serious and I say to Kona
          hypothetically if all of the other contestants are not able to
          participate on the other exams and only one person is able to
          participate does that person gain a hunter's license understanding the
          meaning of my words kona's eyes widen a little and she says well that
          would depend on the exam Proctor I myself like to be sure that a
          hunter has the abilities to survive meet me after 10 hours for a
          little Spar in room NR 127 and there we will see if you have them I
          just look towards her with a serious face and then a bright smile
          appears on my face then in a happy way I say to Kona I will see you
          there then I pick up my briefcase and without even drinking my whiskey
          I just turn around and walk away while I am walking away I go towards
          one of the empty Pathways and I crouch down and open my briefcase
          inside it there are hundreds of small canisters with a gas mask in it
          I take two of the can ERS and an empty canister and mix them together
          I then put on the gas mask time to get me some exp at 400 in the
          morning while everyone is asleep I go towards each of the rooms and
          put some heavy knockout gas that will keep them down for about 5 days
          I go outside of the rooms and just wait they really seem like they are
          tired today by 5: in the morning everyone was knocked out I take out a
          scalpel from the inside of my suit and go towards the men users that I
          remembered from before when I arrive at their rooms I kill the First
          with a simple needle quickly inserted into his brain I am already used
          to death from my work in medicine and I don't necessarily feel bad if
          other people die for my benefits then I activate my hatsu the tablet
          appears into my hand and with the other hand I touch the N user's body
          and Flash chapter 7 then a notification appears on my tablet 45 exp H
          so that guy gave me 45 then let's see the others I am at the other n
          user sleeping quarters I see a bunch of other participants sleeping
          around but killing them wouldn't give me any benefits or any
          experience so there is no need for that the nin users seem to be
          sleeping together one is male and the other female maybe they are a
          couple well it doesn't matter anyway I go and kill both of them
          quickly and summon my tablet again and then I touch the headman's
          corpse first flash he turns into glittering lights and goes into my
          tablet this ability might also be good at erasing murder evidence or
          something like that this is the an aspect of my ability that I won't
          use but you never know 19 exp so this one was weaker then I turned
          towards the female men user and used the ability again she also gets
          absorbed into my tablet 22 exp after that I go outside of the room and
          I click on my only app on the tablet Jax Miller age 20 Talent LVL
          50100 exp exp 86 St Str LVL 54100 exp AG LVL 52100 exp n LVL 51,100
          exp n amount LVL 5 42,1 XP when I look at my tablet my eyes
          immediately go towards my n Mount and I wanted to upgrade it but the
          condition that when I upgrade n amount or talent I would be forced
          into a state of zetsu and become unable to use my nen I guess first I
          will spar with Kona and then I will upgrade my nen I start looking for
          room 127 around it didn't take me long to find it and when I did I
          went inside and I saw Kona standing there leaning on the wall and
          sleeping as soon as I enter the room she opens her eyes and looks at
          me are you ready I just put my briefcase down and touch a secret
          button on it without Kona noticing anything as it slowly releases
          something into the air I take off my jacket and the necktie I pull up
          my sleeve and take up a boxing stance against her I then use aren as
          my men explodes from my body reinforcing it as soon as Kona sees this
          she doesn't seem surprised at all as she just Smiles slightly and says
          nice Aura you have there then she releases her own nen I can sense
          that it is more refined but I still use G yo on my eyes for a split
          second and look at her Aura quality and such judging by it she should
          be on the stronger side of the hunter Association that is when her
          Aura starts acting strangely and it starts forming tendrils of nen and
          they turn into snakes like n creatures that are attached to her body
          she then comes towards me I jump sideways and her n snakes who are
          attached to her Aura extend and come towards me with the intent to
          bite me I still just keep dodging one of them even comes close to
          biting my arm but I just bam punch it away then suddenly the snake
          turns around and faces me again ready to attack Kona is also coming
          towards me I put my hands in my pockets and then I take out six
          scalpels and keep them between my fingers and throw them towards Kona
          flash she easily Dodges them all and her snake is close to me now then
          I stealthily put my hand in my pocket and aim my gun which is still in
          my pocket towards Kona pow pow I shot towards her 12 consecutive times
          and since she was dodging my scalpel she wasn't able to dodge all of
          the bullets and even though she had Aran active the bullets still left
          some slightly bleeding wounds on her after all not all n users can
          stop bullets like they are nothing but I still kept her n snake on my
          vision and as he was sneakily about to bite me on my leg I just bomb
          kick him away and immediately look towards the bleeding cona she just
          smirks towards me and I can see her exposed muscles tightening and
          stopping the bleeding on wounded areas damn those are some nice
          abdominal muscles well then let's see how long you can last Kona after
          a couple minutes of me just dodging suddenly Kona just bomb drops to
          her knees and falls down unconscious it took quite some time for the
          poison to take effect when I had put down my briefcase the button I
          touched activated a secret compartment that spews out poison I planed
          to keep her moving around and I would win this I am already immune to
          this type of strong poison so it doesn't work on me then I look at the
          unconscious Kona and notice something strange I see so that is it
          chapter 8 when I look at kona's unconscious body I immediately notice
          something strange I use gyo on my ears to make them slightly more
          sensitive and then I listen to kona's Heart beat I see so that is what
          is happening then I just smirk slightly and loudly say so do I pass
          the hunter exam cona then suddenly kona's unconscious body stirred a
          little and she got up she turned around and looked at me with a smile
          on her face sure you are a hunter now you will just have to wait to
          get your pro hunter card I just nod and go to put on my suit's jacket
          and then grab the briefcase and as I am about to walk out I hear Kona
          say to me by the way how were you able to tell that I was faking it I
          just turned towards her and raise an eyebrow at her and say it was my
          hatsu but how were you able to resist the paralysis poison she just
          smiles and points with her thumb towards her chest in Pride and she
          says of course I can resist a little poison like that I am a poison
          Hunter after all if it was any other Hunter you would have undoubtedly
          defeated them also when did you start spreading the poison I didn't
          quite notice that I just smirk at her and say it was my hat Sue
          ability and just walk away she just puts at this liar I just smirk and
          push my glasses up obviously three people can keep a secret only if
          two are dead as I think I get out of the room and start walking away
          when I walk enough far away I immediately feel a little light headed
          the poison was kind of too strong even for me I immediately took a
          vial from my briefcase and drank it this was an anti then I go towards
          the lounge area I summon my tablet and look at my exp I won't upgrade
          anything yet I will wait until I have enough exp to upgrade my talent
          I then lie down on a big couch damn that was tiring anyway I better go
          to sleep now I am quite tired after 3 days of me just exploring around
          the Airship I found out that there was a training room so here I am
          pulling on some 600 kg weights and I am completely naked while
          training I don't want my suit to become sweat sweaty or anything like
          that I am trying to train my physical stats but it isn't having a lot
          of results I only got four exp on strength two on agility and seven on
          endurance so far the easiest stat to train has been endurance the
          other examinees are still knocked out and sleeping my knockout poison
          was very effective and expensive too I didn't want to leave any
          loopholes in my plans but as I continue training I hear the door of
          the room open when I look at the direction of the door I see Kona when
          she looks at me she immediately freezes in shock I just look towards
          her with my nonchalant face and say to her did you need something Kona
          then she gets out of her trace and keeps looking at my lower body she
          just blushes and covers her face on room number one the chairman is
          waiting for you I just nod towards her and go towards the showers cona
          POV as I look at his back with Rippling compact muscles I immediately
          drop my innocent Act and I can't help but lick my lips a little a now
          I want him really bad no no Kona you must control yourself but a
          little peeking will harm no one as I make a little snake for my aura
          and materialize it to make it look like a real snake the snake then
          falls on the ground and start slithering towards the showers I close
          my eyes and my vision Chans as I start seeing what the snake sees go
          on my after 10 minutes of me spying on him he comes out of the shower
          with his glasses and his suit on looking all prim and proper a I want
          to have a go with him he then comes towards me when he is to my side
          he puts his hand on my shoulder and nonchalantly says you really need
          to hide those predatory eyes of yours they give away your true
          intentions as soon as I hear that I am shaken away from my fantasies
          and truly feel a little embarrassed now damn this is embarrassing
          Jack's POV as I leave behind a shocked Kona I can't help but smirk at
          her reaction I mean I do do not have the best perception but a snake
          on the bathroom yay I am definitely noticing that one only by using
          guo and seeing that it was made out of men did I understand what is
          really going on anyway I start walking towards room number one when I
          arrive there I open the door and see an old man sitting on the ground
          drinking tea with a short table in front of him I immediately
          recognized him as the hunter Association chairman Neo he looks at me
          with a smiling face he looks the same as he did during the anime
          except that his beard is a little shorter this guy really is old he
          then says with a childish smile on his face oh so you are the only one
          who passed the exam this year I just look at him there is no need for
          me to even use gyo to see his Aura I can already feel it his Aura is
          quite massive and at perfect control chapter n Neo just looks at me
          with a childish questioning look then he just hums to himself for some
          seconds before seemingly coming to a decision then he says to me since
          Kona spoke so highly of you you can have your hunter's license when he
          says that he has an unreadable look on his face he takes a hunter's
          card from his pocket and gives it to me he has a certain amused look
          on his eyes that I can't read at all damn I don't like people like
          that at all use this carefully now Move Along he says pulling me out
          of my thoughts I just take my hunter card and immediately turn around
          and start walking away I didn't even say anything anything to him I
          open the door and go outside as soon as I was outside I breathed out a
          sigh of relief I am pretty sure Neo just assessed my potential just
          from that look and I bet he didn't see anything special at least I am
          sure he didn't I couldn't read his true intentions at all I am only
          making assumptions based on what I know of his personality from the
          hxh anime better get out of this Airship I need to start getting
          stronger faster or I will never be able to compete with monsters like
          him and when Canon comes around I want to be able to at least compete
          with Maron just to feel safe one day later I am finally getting off
          that Airship I can now start truly getting stronger also no one even
          mentioned The Disappearance of the three men users from the Airship I
          guess when you design a death game you can't exactly ask other people
          not to kill after that since I was dropped in an Airship station I
          immediately go to the receptionist and ask for another flight I need a
          flight for the Valley of Death the receptionist is about to refuse my
          request but I I just show her my pro hunter card and she just nods and
          gives me a ticket to the Valley of Death the valley of death is a
          dangerous place with vicious beasts that could easily kill humans it
          is a restricted place but with my hunter card I can easily get access
          to the place I look at my hunter card this thing really is useful for
          months after that day and here I am I clean my high caliber sniper put
          it back on my big army backpack I look around at the army of corpses
          around me splattered on rocks and trees the beasts range from giant
          snakes to bigger that normal Bears this is just one of the groups of
          beasts killed by me even though it might seem that in my hatsu there
          are a lot of limitations but I thought about my ability for 20 years
          and I obviously put some not quite loopholes but they are the closest
          thing I can get to them for example I can only get exp from someone
          with their inactivated or something physically as powerful as a hunter
          a hunter is always a human there are a lot of creatures physically as
          powerful as a well-trained human I then summon my tablet on one hand
          and I touched the blood on the ground Foo the corpses all become
          specks of lights and go into my tablet this has now become a familiar
          sight to me I look at my exp and see that it has become 794 this is
          enough for now after that I return back to a cave in the Valley of
          Death inside there is a statue I touched the hand of the statue which
          opens a hidden door I go inside and there is an empty room with only
          only a telephone poll in it I just pick up the phone and dial a number
          and I swipe my hunter card on the left of the poll people what can I
          help you with as soon as I hear that robotic voice I answer I need an
          Airship at the Valley of Death secret hideout number 11 then the
          robotic voice answers the Airship will arrive in 27 hours that is
          perfect works for me I answer with a calm voice click then the line is
          shut I need to get out of here it is not a dangerous place for me or
          anyone now that I exterminated most of the dangerous Beasts for exp I
          was able to raise my efficiency by using my high caliber sniper rifle
          though I still Let The Offspring of the monsters live when they grow
          up they will also give me exp anyway I sit down in the dark room and I
          take out a flashlight from inside my backpack to light up the room and
          as soon as I do so I summon my tablet there is also another hole
          almost loophole in my hat sue my fourth restriction says four after I
          upgrade my n amount or talent in my status page I can't use men for
          one day and I am forced into a state of zetsu but what if I save exp
          and I Mass upgrade at once I will still get only one day of forced
          zetsu immediately I put all of my points into talent and the leftovers
          in an amount you will be forced into zetsu in upgrading process
          starting and as soon as the countdown reached zero flash my n slowly
          started to retract itself inside my body to force me into a state of
          zetsu unable to use my nen at all as soon as that was over my nen was
          sealed for one day I didn't try to resist the forced zetsu even I
          don't know what will happen to me if I break this rule my ability was
          created to be out of my capabilities if I force it it could be from
          something like me losing my hatsu to me dying chapter 10 as soon as I
          am forced into a state of zetsu and have nothing better to do I decide
          to sleep and rest my body after all the last few months living on the
          Wilderness I have always slept between 4 to 6 hours a day for someone
          like me who values the healthy 8 hours of sleep something like this is
          abnormal and unhealthy 24 hours easily pass like this though for the
          first time I truly feel weak without N I know how dangerous that can
          be this condition is also an extreme one and after all no matter how
          strong I grow I will always have a 24h hours weaken state that is the
          condition applied whenever I upgrade my nen amount or talent I am
          forced into a 24 hours in a state of zetsu unable to use nen but also
          in a state of hiding at the same time due to my presence being
          completely dulled by zetsu I look at the ration bars that I was eating
          and I couldn't hold my excitement I was finally going to be able to
          literally feel my progress I then look at my watch 3 2 1 Foo my aura
          nodes open all at once and now my higher amount of n seeps out as soon
          as I feel that I use my almost two decades of handling men and control
          all of my men into submission without any problems this this is
          amazing I can feel the power seeping out and the nin feels natural
          like always after all this n didn't come out of nowhere it is the n
          absorbed from others and turned into mine in a way exp is the currency
          to raise my stats after thinking about that I summon my tablet in my
          hand and click on the status app Jax Miller age 20 Talent LVL 70400
          exp exp 0 Str Str LVL 51 17,100 exp AG LVL 51 15,100 exp and LVL 5
          21,100 EXP n amount LVL 6 32,200 exp going from Level 5 level 7 in N
          Talent might not seem much but level five is average and level seven
          is the same as having the talent of 1 in 10,000 that is rare of course
          nowhere near the one in 10 million that kilowa and Gan had but I am
          not far away from it I will soon just go to another hunting ground
          this one is called the aahz desert it is known for its dangerous
          environment and ancient ruins maybe I should try to become a one-star
          hunter that will open more secret information to me and allow me to
          find more hunting grounds for E well anyway I need to wait some more
          until the Airship arrives just like this 3 hours pass I was just
          trying to see how my new Talent is working run fo my aura bursts out I
          condense it and try to make move along my body faster it listens to my
          will quite easily too amazing simply amazing only 3 hours of training
          and I already advanced my run by a little the advance was truly
          minuscule and unnoticeable by anyone other than me who has been stuck
          in a snail like pace of advancement my Advance on the field of nen was
          at such a slow pace that I only realized that I had Advanced at all
          after months of training I have been training then for 13 years if I
          had this type of talent from the beginning I would have needed only 3
          years to get to the same level that took me 13 years to reach then as
          if a fire was lighted into my heart I couldn't help but obsess I need
          more Talent ring ring ring but my thought process is interrupted when
          I hear the telephone pole ring I go towards it and answer it hello I
          am the pro hunter Jax where will I meet the Airship that I will fly on
          then a normal male voice comes from the other side of the phone the
          Airship is above the mountain when you arrive at the top see us signal
          us somehow and we will throw down a rope ladder for you I just answer
          with a simple okay I pack my backpack and things then I get ready for
          some mountain climbing also I need to test something about my talent
          stat then I get out of the secret room and start climbing the mountain
          to reach the top as I am halfway the mountain I am not really a
          professional mountain climber but as I am climbing I notice that I am
          doing some things wrong while climbing fol focus on my hips I need to
          try to keep one hip pushed up against the wall I must have a hip close
          to the wall so it brings my shoulder closer when I arrive at the top
          of the mountain I have to stop myself from shaking because of
          excitement the normal human has different amount of Talent on
          different skills for example someone might be good at cooking but bad
          at martial arts that is normal but me in the beginning when I created
          my hatsu I noticed that some things like memory learning skills got
          worse but my cooking got a little better I suspected it since then but
          now I understand this is an unintended limitation on my hatsu it did
          lower my talent in some things to make them average level lvl5 but now
          I literally have the talent of one in 10,000 in everything I try this
          ability just went from having good potential to out of this world I
          will literally be able to advance limitlessly at anything I try yes ha
          then I have to forcefully calm myself because this literally means
          that I could defeat someone like moram at anything he tries but only
          if I have my talent stat at like 11 or 12 I then see the Airship and I
          signal them they notice me and they drop a rope ladder from the
          Airship I immediately climb it and when I get on the ship I see a
          female flight attendant with black curly hair blue eyes and heavy
          makeup pretty average overall then she comes towards me with a good
          fake practiced smile and says sir about your payment I just nod
          towards her and say 1 million right she he just nods and then I take
          out a checkbook and write the amount down and give it to her then I
          ask her is there a computer here she nods and then guides me to a room
          where there were around 10 computers I go inside the room and turn on
          one of the computers and put my hunter card on it soon I the computer
          automatically goes to the Hunter's website only for hunters currently
          there are around 600 Hunters all around the world and I go towards the
          hunter list finally I arrived at the one I wanted and pressed contact
          chapter 11 when I am calling the person on the computer I see that the
          call is going so that means that he is online he then answers in a
          green-headed bean-like person without a nose and wearing a suit
          appears on the screen when he sees me he has a smile on his face as he
          starts introducing himself hi I am Secretary of the hunter
          association's chairman what can I help you with says the green bean
          guy I just nod at him politely I already know of him from the Hunter x
          Hunter story in my past life I have eliminated the dangerous Monsters
          of the Valley of Death though I did leave the younger ones alive I
          didn't want to destroy the local ecosystem so I was wondering if that
          warrants an upgrade to a one star hunter I just calmly say all of this
          to him my face expressionless not showing my feelings on the matter at
          all the bean looking man takes a thinking pose and the after a couple
          of seconds he finally answers I will need to send some people to
          confirm this but if you did what you say that you did he then takes
          some more time to think things through come on green bean can't you
          rush a little I have plans to follow I am on a schedule here while the
          thing that you did was truly useful and because of the less in danger
          more rookie hunters will probably go there that isn't truly a excuse
          me for my language remarkable enough to earn a one star though if you
          were to do the same in another hostile environment that has some
          historical values you would probably be up gred to a onear hunter I
          just nod at him already understanding what he means by what he is
          saying I then ask him my next question then next time I am going to
          the arz desert it is said that place has a lot of ancient ruins and
          pyramids some of them unexplored beans just looks at me already seeing
          what I am getting at so he just says don't worry about raising your
          rank too much a hunter just hunts something so if you do what you like
          I am am sure that you will get to become a one-star Hunter I just
          smile at him politely but on the inside I couldn't help but think ah
          he is going to be a pain in the ass isn't he but even while thinking
          that I still decide to just calmly say sure no problem and then I cut
          off the chat I need to become a higher ranked Hunter to get the secret
          information on any biomes that even information Brokers can't get also
          I am always hunting what I want I hunt EXP 8 months later after my
          talk with the green bean also I am already at the age of 21 I look all
          around me at the desert surrounding me I have been surviving here for
          a long time drinking from the only water source nearby and eating
          monster flesh resisting the cold at night has also helped me
          tremendously to form a type of very low-level cold resistance I am
          wearing a well-maintained soldier uniform with a helmet I hear a
          strange Roar as the sand in front of me moves and boom I look at the
          giant green lizard that appears in front of me it has eight legs in
          front of me the creature is as big as a one-story house though am I
          also am fully armed with different blades I have already run out of
          bullets a long time ago but I still have the short sword and knives I
          brought along I then pull out my short sword from the sheath while I
          see that the Beast is waiting I summon my N Tablet and now there is
          another app except status it is my new hatsu it is called called
          Gamers glasses can get all of the information from a Target like
          physical strength and an amount just by looking at the target with the
          glasses on the glasses also reveal any Neen hidden by in in without
          the need to use gyo consciously it also acts as a Data Bank where I
          can store information and can be used for different calculations
          conditions if you drink the blood of the creature you are able to find
          out some general information about their inability the information
          will appear in the form of of a riddle if you drink the blood of a
          human under the age of 15 you will be able to tell their talent on any
          end I click the app and the glasses appear on my face I then make the
          tablet turn back into any end but my glasses still stay I look at the
          lizard in front of me and see a lvl4 displayed above his head I have
          already fought the same type of lizard creature countless times
          already but this is also good because this should give me some more
          exp then at this moment the giant lizard decides to charge towards me
          I don't even Dodge it but as soon as it is close to me and as expected
          it doesn't bite but it uses his tail as a surprise attack and as soon
          as the tail gets close to me I use shu to surround the sword with men
          and FSH I cut off the tail of the giant lizard which makes it Roar in
          pain as its blood sprays around while that is happening my glasses
          again pointed out the routes that based on the other similar lizards
          how this lizard will attack then it has a 23 % chance to attack me
          with his right leg and the other attacks all have chances lower than
          6% in battle calculations are hard but with time as I fight more and
          more these glasses will adapt more to it and give more accurate
          readings though the calculations kind of suck after all against
          something intelligent like a human it is pretty much useless after all
          humans have thousands of options attack patterns and Marshall Arts
          that they can attack with then there is nen and special abilities
          created by n complicating it even even more I prepared to dodge its
          right leg but this time it actually decided to attack with its tongue
          this is new but I was still prepared for any attack I don't trust the
          accuracy of the glass's calculating power its calculating power isn't
          anything special there are smart people who could most likely do even
          more accurate calculations as soon as the lizard's tongue is about to
          touch me the tongue FSH falls on the ground chapter 12 so as soon as
          the giant lizard's tongue falls on the ground while still using shu to
          run and through my weapon I just cut its tongue before it could touch
          me I push off the ground and towards the giant lizard Flash and with a
          clean sweeping slash I cut off the lizard's head then like usual I
          just summon my Neen tablet and the body turns into particles then I
          click into my stats page and my glasses dissipate back into Neen Jax
          Miller age 21 Talent LVL 70400 exp exp 1366 St Str LVL 5 31,100 exp AG
          LVL 534,906 139,900 exp I looked at my stats and especially at my exp
          I was tempted so many times to upgrade my Neen talent but I always
          remembered the condition that I made to myself for my ability to be
          forced into a state of zetsu when I upgrade either my anyn talent or
          anyn amount that is no joke especially in a dangerous environment like
          this I will be no different than a human then as I look at my exp I
          still have to force myself to not push the stat to upgrade I have
          already seen what a level s Talent which is one in 10,000 can do what
          about a level 9 which is one in a million it is literally 100 times
          better than level s Talent the speed at which I Advance would be at
          break neck speeds then as I am about to walk away I noticed that where
          the lizard had fallen the sand had moved away to reveal Stone no it
          seems like some type of brick is this some type of ruin the arz desert
          is known for its ruins and all that but I never really thought I would
          find one I mean a person has to be pretty lucky to find one and I
          never count on things like luck but I am not about to kick away a gift
          like this just hope that it at least has something valuable in it
          immediately I serious and used Shu on my sword to run any end through
          it flash with some quick slashes I cleanly cut the stone on front of
          me Boom the stone fell and made some noise down below so that means
          that there is a room in there I use to sense any movements in there
          since I use this time while fighting here in the desert to learn
          Advanced nean Techniques so I am pretty proficient in them even though
          my talent is one in 10,000 using any of the Advanced Techniques takes
          a lot of Neen from me though I still can use them in short intervals
          of time like right now when I am using Ian to sense any movements
          inside the room and there are none damn it really seems like an
          unexplored ruin I then jump inside and when I look around there is
          only dust and darkness that is until my eyes adjust to the darkness
          and with the help of the light coming from the hole I noticed some
          ancient drawings in the walls in the beginning it looks like normal
          humans fighting against huge beasts but then I saw the drawing of a
          map on the wall and immediately like a lightning strike I understood
          what these drawings Express these drawings are about the Dark
          Continent when I start inspecting them a little closer and paying more
          attention to them they immediately start making more sense they do
          talk of fighting some beasts but mostly what they talk about how to
          survive on the Dark Continent the different ways on how to get food
          while you are are there farming methods how to run away from certain
          monsters and how to counteract some of the dangerous monsters
          abilities immediately after using my glasses and storing all of the
          data of these drawings that were in this type of underground Temple
          that was probably buried by some natural catastrophe I take out my
          sword and use shu to run any end through my sword and then I started
          scratching off all of the drawings after all it is better to have a
          monopoly over something then let someone else use it after doing that
          I start hitting all of the weak points holding the underground Temple
          together and then I go outside of it this should make it more
          difficult for any Neen user with some type of rewind ability it is
          unlikely for that to happen but who knows really then I reach inside
          my uniform and pull out an old style cubic phone that looks like a
          brick I look at my phone and dial a number on it pyu pyu pyu I am just
          King an Airship to come and pick me up I am going back to civilization
          it is around 45 hours later that I noticed the Airship that came to
          take me away when I saw that the Airship arrived I can't help but
          somehow feel familiar with this ship they dropped me a rope ladder oh
          I remember now it was the same Airship that took me off the valley of
          death and brought me here I immediately went towards the computer room
          and put in my hunter card in the computer port and then I entered the
          hunter website again I immediately called beans when I see his face he
          has a look of recognition on his eyes he most likely remembers me from
          the last time and then without me saying anything he says I can
          already guess what you are going to say from your location and we will
          still investigate the desert but you Jax Miller have achieved the rank
          of a one-star Hunter come to the hunter Association building and we
          will give you your new card I just seriously nod towards beans He Just
          Smiles at that well then goodbye Dr Miller says the beans the bean
          likee thing I wonder what type of creature even is he maybe he is just
          some human born with a mutation and he closes off the chat after that
          I immediately go towards a sleeping room on the Airship I take a
          shower and while I do that I also fill up a tub with warm water and
          lay in it ah this feels good then while in the tub I summon my tablet
          in my hand and I immediately go towards my stats time to upgrade
          chapter 13 while in the tub filled with hot water when I feel it run
          through my skin I can't help but appreciate the water as it feels like
          the best bath in my life and I actually haven't taken a shower in 8
          months in the desert so that definitely is a big factor in my opinion
          being kind of crooked but really though civilization really is the
          best place to be I then decide to look at my stats on the tablet Jax
          Miller age 21 Talent LVL 70400 exp exp 1366 St LVL 5 31,100 Ex x p AG
          LVL 5 34,100 exp n LVL 5 36,100 exp n amount LVL 6 139,900 exp then I
          immediately put my exp into talent to bring it up to level 9 and then
          I put the rest into anyn amount and bring it up to level s which is
          around equal to a strong Phantom troop member in an amount though
          obviously stats aren't something that one should judge combat
          capability by I look at my new stats again Jax Miller age 21 Talent
          LVL 90180 exp exp 0 St LVL 5 31,100 exp AG LVL 5 34,100 exp and LVL 5
          36,100 EXP amount LVL 75,4 exp your will be forced into zetsu in you
          will now enter zetsu I don't resist the procedure at all now I can be
          in a state of zetsu as all of my nen is put back into my body so
          without fear of being ripped to shreds from a desert creature it might
          accidentally find me soon I will need to start upgrading my body to
          that is if I want to feel safe during this time of forc zetsu level 9
          Talent means one in a million Talent hahahaha one in a million I can't
          believe it that I am already at that level that is what is called
          monstrous Talent still though while not at gone or killua's level but
          it is still pretty close only one level away and I also have more Aura
          than most of the hunters in the world so there is that too level seven
          Aura is around the amount that someone like yagin or a phantom troop
          member has at level eight in AA amount is Neo then at level 9 will be
          the Royal Guards and then level 10 will be the King level I can't wait
          to get to that level just like this 2 days pass me by really fast
          playing with my new Talent is pretty fun I flex my aura a little it
          comes flowing naturally and clearly in almost a beautiful way that is
          I use aren boom my aura explodes out of me turning from a beautiful
          flow into a violent one like tendrils of Darkness extending out even
          the room around me is shaking a little if I went all out just by
          standing in place and violently start using Reen it would definitely
          destroy the room after that I start using 10 flash my aura immediately
          turns peaceful and comes back into my body turning to normal I look at
          my hand and clench it into a fist and in just one day I made so much
          progress on my Reen that with my previous Talent it would have taken
          years no probably Decades of non-stop training for me to finally be
          able to reach where I am now though the progress was only so good
          because I already was pretty good at at it and had experience using
          nen for a long time then I look out of the window of my room in the
          Airship and I see the hunter Association building he finally I am here
          when I arrive at the building the Airship carefully docks on top of
          the building so I just get out and go towards the elevator and use my
          hunter card to open the elevator and then I press the 100th floor
          button the floor is also known as the Chairman's floor when the
          elevator door opens I see that the floor is more like a long hallway
          with a door at the end of the hallway it has different paintings and
          even some vases I use gu to concentrate Aura on my eyes and look at
          the objects around me I look at all of them and see that they all have
          men in them they would probably fetch a pretty good price on the
          market then when I arrive in front of the door of the Chairman's
          office I just simply knock once and then I hear the old Chairman's
          voice say come in when I enter the room I see Neo sitting behind a
          desk his office is unlike the hallway it looks too minimalistic with
          only some usual office trinkets the only thing out of place here is
          the framed shirt with a red kanji 4 heart isn't that his lucky t-shirt
          in which he fights against [ __ ] I wonder if he took that shirt when
          he went to the Dark Continent wonder if he puts some restrictions on
          his abilities so they become stronger when he wears that shirt I mean
          and works in a lot of different ways it is unpredictable and can at
          the same time be the most predictable sht in the world but I stop my
          thought process from wondering as I look at the chairman who is
          sitting on his expensive looking chair playing with a yo-yo I just
          look at him then when he notices me just looking at him he puts the
          yo-yo away what the hell is he scile or something if I didn't know
          about him from the anime I would have passed him as just another
          eccentric old man but now I see that contrary to his attitude when we
          first met he looks at me with a serious look on his face while playing
          with his beard his eyes also have a certain shine in them that
          definitely makes me have a chill on my spine that is when Neo Smiles
          at me I see that you have advanced quite a bit from the last time I
          saw you young man as he says that I can't help but have a sense of
          respect for this man's experience he just read my strength so easily
          and he needed Just One Look he didn't even need to use nen that is
          something that he most likely learned while he fought countless
          opponents during his lifetime this is the man who has reached the
          Pinnacle of strength available for Humanity the man who dedicated his
          life to Perfection and martial arts that is something I can understand
          searching for Perfection and surpassing an unstable adversary though I
          don't agree with the Unstoppable adversary I would rather not fight
          against something like that no matter how strong I am chapter 14 as
          soon as he says that I just calmly smile and say to him in a happy
          voice I must say that my progress was mostly because of my
          life-threatening situation he just looks at me me with his knowing old
          man look and he starts humming in a low tune as he says cool so what
          are you here for I just act like I am tired and say to him hasn't
          beans already told you I am here for the promotion to a one-star
          Hunter then his face brightens up just like he remembered this damn
          old man I know he is messing around with me but I still can't do
          anything since I can sense that his Aura is still way above mine of
          course his Aura doesn't have any malicious intent on it to make me
          scared or anything like that but his quality of Aura it is almost
          beautiful yeah I remember that says Neo his voice cutting me out of my
          thought process he then takes something from his pocket and throws it
          at me while saying here it is you young people are no fun nowadays I
          just grab the card which has a one star on it and leave back my
          previous no star hunter card and I turn back open the door and
          immediately go outside that old man is creepy I can't read in the
          slightest what he is thinking I can only try to predict by analyzing
          his real personality and that is not a good thing because if you take
          off Neo's mischievous mask he is a twisted individual he was willing
          to let as many as 5 million people die if that ensured the end of the
          Chimera and Kingdom also he often enjoyed giving Hunters he trusted
          imposs assignments sometimes with deadlines of only a few months that
          should take years to complete after all he only took nav and Morel on
          a suicide mission Neo already considered himself dead even even before
          he made contact with the ants he knew that there was a high chance of
          death for them and he still decided to not notify any of the zodiacs
          to come help him also there is the other reason that he himself liked
          challenges to the point he wanted his vice chairman to be someone he
          just could not get along with but he also has good points to him after
          all he banned travel to the Dark Continent and he definitely helped a
          lot of people so there is that too but just because he did that
          doesn't make him any less dangerous after all the world isn't just
          black and white anyway as soon as I am outside I go towards the
          Airship again and into the computer room the pilot and the staff was
          away so when I went there no one was inside I look at the new
          information on my hunter website account I immediately started
          searching for cities in poverty and I found one dungi city 98%
          unemployment rate population 400 crime rate also around 98% this city
          is perfect for my goals also it seems like no one is allowed in or out
          of the city by the V5 but I am a onear hunter now so of course I am
          allowed in I spent one month in this hellish City it was a little hard
          smuggling things on the inside at first but the results are really
          worth it I am currently in a big shabby building in dungi city in
          front of me are 100 starving people I just look at them with kind eyes
          and tell them the Lord shall watch over us please eat and after eating
          come here and I will do the sacred ritual on you then I opened 10 big
          sacks full of food and bread then I even went to the side and brought
          the heavy tub of water after they finish eating one of them comes
          towards me and Bows in front of me while saying Oh Holy One please
          bless me I just look at him I have become like a religious leader here
          I have the food and physical power to protect myself and so I call
          them all to come and pray together while I don't care about any God
          after all even if an almighty God did exist leaving people starve to
          death and so he is definitely an evil God so there is that but I only
          do this because of my own benefit I touched the head of this follower
          pushing then into his body flash activating his Aura nodes after
          opening the aura nodes of all of the people in here and then asking
          them to make a blood sacrifice to the god 17 of them died because they
          couldn't control their Aura then I go to another sack that is just
          lying in there this one is smaller so I just pick it up and take out a
          gun AK47 and aim it towards all of the people in front of me papa papa
          paa papa and with that and while using shu to cover all of my bullets
          with nen and the manipulation category having the ability to put most
          nen in an object I slaughtered them all pow and as the bodies of the
          last one fell down I just looked at him and he also seemed to be alive
          and he had a shocked look on his eyes this guy was at the back of the
          crowd so the bullets didn't reach him but I should train my aim a
          little more after all with level 99 Talent then the person looks at me
          with a look of betrayal and despair then he desperately says W cough
          why I didn't answer and just point my gun at his head pow shot him in
          his brain I truly don't like killing but I don't hate it either if it
          gives me some type of benefit I will do it if not then I won't it's
          just as simple as that to me I don't lose a wink of sleep when I kill
          but neither do I gain pleasure from it though I do gain pleasure from
          something else I summon my tablet in my hand and touch the blood of
          all the people on the ground the first condition that I had for my
          ability one the organisms must have their n noes open or be at least
          as strong as the average Hunter physically to get exp from them they
          have their Min noes open so chapter 15 3 months pass after the
          massacre while I am taking a shower I look at my stats Jax Miller age
          21 Talent LVL 90160 exp exp 3261 St LVL 5 38,1 exp AG LVL 5 40,100 exp
          n LVL 5 44,100 exp n amount LVL 8 532,000 exp I have understood
          something critical for my gamer system it qualifies strength in a
          different way than most people I guess my subconscious thoughts on
          strength must have affected it too I have noticed that there are
          different criteria about strength and how much exp I get for example
          the more intelligent a creature the more exp I get from it also the
          more potential unknown DNA good genetics Etc the more exp they give I
          guess that exp given isn't quantifiable just by the strength of my
          opponent but then again I guess that even though I use my love for
          games to create this hatsu other traits of my personality leak through
          during the creation anyway I have already killed thousands of people
          in this city after activating their Aura nodes in the residence I need
          to get out of here soon people have started noticing that thousands of
          them are gone they don't care since almost everyone here is a criminal
          but if tens of thousands of people come after me with guns and
          grenades I wouldn't be sure I Will Survive also my talent has started
          to truly show its strength my aura has been rising continuously and I
          am easily mastering Advanced and techniques this is amazing using my
          talent I even mastered knife fighting to a high level just in case I
          can do a lot of tricks with knives that no one could even imagine
          honestly having this type of high Talent is so amazing I then turn my
          tablet back into my men and go outside of the shower when I am outside
          I put on a tracksuit and towards the kitchen and once I am there I see
          a young girl around 11 years old she has short black hair and black
          emotionless eyes I found her sleeping on the sidewalk of one of the
          roads she was wearing rags and I didn't really care in the beginning
          after all it's just another homeless kid on this sht city but like
          usual I had my hatsu active Gamers glasses and saw that her Aura was
          bigger than average so out of curiosity I secretly took a needle and
          drank some a drop of her blood to determine her Talent with the help
          of my Gamers glasses it was around lvl9 talent in Neen that was
          surprising to me that amount of talent is only seen one in a million
          so I immediately took her in and have been teaching her anyen in here
          secretly I don't let her know of my activities in this city and just
          tell her that I am here to help people also she didn't have a name so
          I gave her one I named her masasa from an anime from my last life I am
          not good with names so I chose that one Mikasa was abandoned by her
          parents at the age of 6 years old and survived until the age of 12
          during which I found her she used to eat from garbage cans that is
          also the reason she looks more like a 6 years old than a 12-year-old
          kid she was malnourished for quite some time I then cooked some
          scrambled eggs and put them on the table and Mikasa immediately comes
          and sits down and even though she has an emotionless look in her eyes
          I know that she is happy she just can't express her feelings plus with
          my level of talent I am already a five-star Chef without even trying
          that hard to become a better cook as expected if one in a million
          Talent as a chef when I put the food in front of her I noticed that
          she is holding her favorite toy a brown plushy with a wolf's head and
          human looking body wearing casual clothes it was the first toy I gave
          her she likes it like no other when I gave her that toy she actually
          cried when I see her toy I tell her I told you Mikasa put the toy away
          when you eat she looks conflicted for a second but then she says in
          her usual monotone voice yes Sensei then she starts eating after 10
          days since then I hold mikasa's hand while we just walk outside of the
          city without anyone even stopping us when we are about 100 m away from
          the city an Airship descends from the sky and like usual it throws
          some rope stairs I just pick up Mikasa with one hand and started
          climbing the Rope stairs when I arrive at the top and enter the
          Airship I see that it was the usual one that I take I then take Mikasa
          towards the training room and I said to her in an encouraging voice go
          and practice aren until you can hold it as long as you can after that
          rest and when you seem ready try again if you are hungry just I point
          towards a phone on the corner of the room ask on that phone and
          someone will come to bring you food also if you get too tired or
          sleepy you can also ask from the phone to bring you to a room then I
          just Pat her head and while smiling I tell her I will go and talk to
          the the captain about some procedures she just nods and says with her
          monotone voice yes Sensei and then she uses AR and her Aura bursts out
          and she enters into deep concentration after that I go towards the
          captain's cabin and when I enter I see the captain in there with a
          cigarette in his mouth he has a full beard now when I enter he turns
          around and says how can I help you sir Jax I just smile lightly and
          say to him in a calm voice sorry for bothering you Captain I just
          wanted to say that my next destination is Heaven's Arena he is about
          to say something but I act like I don't notice and close the door and
          go outside he was probably going to say the cost and time of the trip
          I don't need to worry about that after all I have enough money and I
          can already guess the price range and as usual I go towards the
          bathrooms and I go towards a mirror and summon my inan unlike half a
          month ago my inan comes out smoothly in an almost an way as I summon
          my tablet once it appears on my hand I immediately click on the stats
          app and finally I can't wait to spend this exp chapter 16 I look at
          myself in the mirror and when I look at my stats Jax Miller age 21
          Talent LVL 90160 exp ex 3261 St Str LVL 5381 100 exp AG LVL 5 40,100
          exp n LVL 5441 100 exp n amount LVL 85328 exp my plan is to use just,
          1600 exp to upgrade my talent to the next level I also plan to try and
          upgrade my physical stats a little after all I need to see if that has
          any unknown drawbacks assuming that I know 100% % of my ability would
          be wrong I did create it with certain conditions in mind but I have
          already seen things that I didn't know about in the ability like the
          EXP calculations and such after giving this much thought I decide to
          use 62 exp to upgrade my strength to level six crack crack crack my
          body is immediately assaulted with an enormous amount of pain as I
          feel my bones crack but it also goes away after 10 or so seconds it
          seems like it's not good to upgrade in any way way in the middle of a
          battle that pain though it lasted only for a couple of seconds it was
          the worst pain I have felt up to date that would be disastrous during
          a battle after sighing a little in relief I look at myself in the
          mirror and I have gotten a little bulkier and my muscles a little more
          defined I then decided to put another 60 exp to upgrade my agility to
          level six also and as soon as I do so cling I could feel as if my
          muscle tendons were getting ripped apart at my joints there was pain
          all over my body but at the joints the pain is the most horrible but
          that pain also lasted around 7 to 10 seconds I look at my body again
          in the mirror and notice that my body has gotten thinner and my
          muscles even more defined again H so that is how it works huh I
          decided to put another 56 exp into endurance this time the feeling of
          absolute burning around my body appears but this pain was over in just
          a second faster than even raising strength I look at my body and don't
          see any major difference then I tried jumping around I was a little
          disoriented at first but in about a minute I got perfect control of my
          strength I guess Talent helps with that too then I continue upgrading
          all of my physical stats to level seven and use all of my leftover exp
          to upgrade some more things until I have zero exp left Jax Miller age
          21 Talent LVL 10320 EXP exp Z St LVL 70400 exp AG LVL 70400 exp n LVL
          8 25,800 exp n amount LVL 90160 exp finally I am strong enough as I am
          thinking that a notification appears you will be forced into zetsu
          soon my Aura All Around Me shuts down and comes inside of my own body
          I will be in a state of weakness for 24 hours this condition will be
          my Achilles heel so I need to be careful about it it takes 11 days for
          me to arrive at my destination masasa is next to me as we look over
          the edge of the Airship we are currently at the balcony of the Airship
          together and I see the heavens Arena City below we are around 30 60 m
          in the air then I look at Mikasa and I hear her ask so where is the
          Rope leader that we will go down with Sensei I just look at her and
          smile then I grab her in a princess carry and hear her say in a
          slightly panicked voice what are you doing Sensei then I jump off the
          Airship and that is the first time I ever saw Mikasa truly scared her
          eyes widened and a look of absolute Terror on her face as she screams
          to me in a loudly panicked voice we are going to die Sensei I keep
          smiling at her and we then hit the ground boom a dust cloud is made
          all around us my feet don't even feel numb from handling all of the
          jump Mikasa seems panicked but I just say to her with a smile still on
          my face don't worry Mikasa have some trust in me haah it took even
          Mikasa about 3 hours to go back to her calm demeanor we are currently
          dining at an expensive restaurant on Heaven's Arena after we finish
          eating I say to Mikasa in an encouraging voice Mikasa I brought you
          here to temper and train your nen and I also want you to develop a
          hatsu no matter what don't try to copy anyone's hatsu because it won't
          be strong or effective and you will only get a weaker version of the
          original though you can use certain parts of someone else's abilities
          as a foundation for your own also since you are a conjur try making
          something and don't be shy to put some conditions on it it will just
          make it stronger but don't put anything too extreme or it will hinder
          you just put your own ambition and Power into it I continue giving her
          tips on creating her ability a conjury needs to keep an open mind on
          their hatsu creation but at the same time they need to be stubborn
          about it too Mikasa POV when I hear my Sensei say that I can't help
          but contemplate hatua Sensei always says that it should be a
          representation of yourself and at the same time be something that you
          need I then look at Sensei and ask him what about you Sensei what is
          your hatsu when I asked ask him he seems a little surprised at this
          but he smirks and answers chapter 17 Mikasa POV when I asked him about
          his hatsu Sensei just smiled at me and conjured a pair of glasses on
          his face then he said softly with an amused tone to his voice these
          glasses allow me to see information about my opponent and a lot of
          other minuscule things wow uh that is kind of underwhelming after all
          Sensei is so strong physically and his Aura is very power powerful but
          an ability like that sounds more oriented towards support than combat
          Sensei looks at me with a knowing look on his face as if he already
          knows what I am thinking I know it might not seem powerful but men
          battles are more complicated than just raw power so since I already
          have enough raw power I choose this one to help me determine my
          opponent's power and like always even though I always have my normal
          face with no expression Sensei is able to tell what I am thinking but
          still though I am definitely nor having a hatsu like that I need the
          raw power not the efficiency that Sensei needs and just like that
          after some time Sensei decided to register us both for the heavens
          Arena Sensei went first to fight on the first floor and sensei's
          opponent was a guy with muscles like a swimmer but as soon as he saw
          Sensei he immediately gave up and then when the referee noticed that
          Sensei had been here before he immediately sent Sensei to the 150th
          floor with that me and Sensei will not have to fight against each
          other since our floor will be too far apart then comes my fight my
          opponent seems like a skinny guy wearing a tracksuit he seems around
          his 20s with brown hair and brown eyes when he sees me he gets a
          complicated look on his face and he says to the referee uh fighting a
          kid I am not really comfortable the referee just frowns at him and
          says this is your opponent you either fight or you give up the fight
          then my skinny opponent just frowns back but instead of anger it's
          more like annoyance no it's okay I will fight as soon as the referee
          announced us to begin fighting I immediately charged towards him with
          a punch ready to meet his face he just Dodges and jumps back then I go
          after him again and punch him he blocks my punch with his palm I send
          a kick towards his legs but he jumps up and Dodges he does a back flip
          and while moving backwards Jack MC POV and after a minute or so I
          noticed that mikasa's opponent still hasn't thrown attack at her
          probably because she was a child or some sense of kindness like that
          anyway I noticed that he slips on the stage and falls down and Mikasa
          is about to punch him in the face but she stops just before her punch
          connected with his face and her opponent falls on his back and starts
          Breathing heavily even after this little exercise I put my glasses on
          and noticed that her opponent seems to have something strange about
          him but I can't tell what it is yet damn can't these shtt glasses be a
          little more useful I know I created them myself but it mostly had the
          intention of finding talented individuals then as Mikasa is allowed to
          move to the 10th floor for her fight I told her to go to my room in
          the tower of heaven and rest I decide to follow the guy what I noticed
          with my glasses is that he has a weak vitality and below average Aura
          but what really drew me to follow him is because even though it seemed
          like he had never been in a real fight and knew no martial arts but he
          was still able to keep up with Mikasa who trained with me for a couple
          months which is pretty good I also have this hunch that things aren't
          as simple as they seem when I follow him in an Alleyway and he takes
          off his jacket I see that he has needle piercing marks all over his
          arms and I immediately know what is happening so he does drugs well
          that is disappointing I thought that he was special or something like
          that but he could still have his uses I immediately think of a plan
          this could be either good or fruitless Endeavor if it doesn't work my
          way I immediately stealthily go behind him and Bam I knock him out
          with a soft chop to his neck I put on his jacket make a little cut on
          him to taste his blood and see his talent though he is older than 15
          so the glasses aren't 100% accurate his talent still doesn't seem to
          be that bad I put him on a piggyback and I casually walk towards
          Heaven's Arena lvl8 n talent that is lower than masasa but still one
          is 100,000 am I really this lucky to find a person like him around but
          I guess that no normal person chooses to fight in a Heaven's Arena
          level 8 that will definitely help me on my plans I have never been
          this lucky but I guess that probabilities work in strange
          circumstances and that no normal person at such a young age comes to
          fight in Heaven's Arena damn did I expend all of my life's luck in
          finding him I really hope not after some time I finish carrying him
          back to my my Heaven's Arena room in the tower I see that Mikasa was
          here meditating while having her Reen act if she truly is a
          hardworking student then I drop the guy that I was carrying on the
          ground and take off his shirt then I pull out some needles and
          medicine from my first aid kit and use shu to run some then through
          the needle this guy's symptoms are malnourishment drug addiction some
          bones that haven't healed correctly and some more lower level internal
          injuries if I don't heal those he will never be able to reach his peak
          of power well then let's start the procedure I start cutting him up
          and putting in place some old broken bones as soon as Mikasa sees what
          I was doing I explain that I was helping him but she still goes and
          rents another room in the city I guess she doesn't have the ability to
          stomach blood and organs yet after putting his bones in place tie his
          arm and muscles together then I patch his arm up I go towards his
          internal organs and first I cut some parts of his liver they are
          infected did I also flushed his stomach with the help of nen and with
          my talent my medical skills have gone to the top of this world I could
          literally keep a cut off head alive if I have the necessary tools I
          mean I mostly studied medicine as a dedication to my hatsu just like
          Neo did 10 0 punches I spent 5 years studying medicine and even
          continue up till today anyway I better keep my mind on the procedure
          after 2 hours the whole procedure is done and I patched him up up I
          even use some organic type of glue to keep his internal organs
          together he will have to not overspend his body or he would die of
          internal bleeding if his surgeries open up then after I take him out
          of his anesthesia his eyes immediately opened and a trace of clear
          Panic can be seen in them chapter 18 General POV when JX looks at the
          thin person who is now wrapped in bandages when the other person opens
          his eyes he is immediately in panic and tries to get up and with great
          difficulty he does so Jax doesn't stop him at all he just looks at him
          with indifferent eyes as he sees the slightly dazed look on the man's
          face Jax decides this is the perfect moment to ask him a question what
          is your name the other guy instinctively answered my name is kid then
          kid looks around and asks wait who am I how do I know my own name what
          is happening Jax just looked at him strangely and looked looked at kid
          with a worried look while saying I don't know much about you I found
          you at the side of the road the only thing I know is that you fought
          my student at the heavens Arena kid was concentrating hard but he just
          couldn't remember anything about himself what was going on why can't
          he remember he lies down again since he was feeling quite a lot of
          pain just from standing up then he asks the man that helped him where
          did you find me and in what condition was I in when you found me maybe
          that will give me a clue to what is going on Jax just frowns in
          concentration as if trying to remember something in the end he simply
          says I found you in an alley you were overdosed on drugs you were also
          beaten up and almost had a lot of internal bleeding if I didn't bring
          you here to do a surgery you might have died then kid looks at his
          hands not knowing what to do next not even knowing who he really was
          did he have a family he never suspected that Jax is lying his
          confusion and making him susceptible to Jax then the young doctor Jax
          that saved kid just gets up and starts walking towards the door but
          suddenly he stops and turns around to look at kid again his glass is
          reflecting the light so from his position kid couldn't see the look on
          Jax's eyes since you don't remember anything and you are my
          responsibility now so you can stay with me and my student until you
          find your Road in life I don't know what you used to be but when I
          found you with all of the drugs in your system and close to death if
          if you go chasing after your past be careful of what you look for says
          Jax with a neutral voice but still giving him a warning then Jax pulls
          off his bloody gloves and throws them in the garbage bin next to the
          exit and then goes outside of the room leaving kid all alone in the
          room with his thoughts then as Jax goes outside of his room leaving
          kid behind he can't help but contemplate the previous situation I
          definitely don't 100% know how the brain works but I know where to hit
          one to make it 100% clean I definitely won't be having druggies as my
          students they are unreliable and prone to mistakes I can't have
          someone like that in my presence yes Jack's completely obliterated kid
          as a person leaving behind only small or in this case instinctual
          parts of him behind let's see how useful you can be to me kid thinks
          Jax as a smile appears on his face so like this 15 days pass Mikasa
          and kid both were sitting in the ground meditating with their calm
          controlled auras flowing through their body though kids was a little
          shaky Jax is just sitting there and reading a book about the latest
          medical discoveries though Mikasa and kid always train around the same
          amount he can't help but compare his progress with mikasa's she was
          already advancing and learning things 10 times faster than him if it
          took him 10 days to learn something it took masasa just one even
          though he was an adult he couldn't beat her even in physical contests
          he couldn't help but hate his past self even his body would have
          become a [ __ ] if Jax didn't help him pring then suddenly an alarm
          clock rings out Jax just looks at it and gets up goes towards the
          clock beside his bed and he turns it off then he started walking
          towards the door when he arrived at the door he told his students I
          have my first fight on the 200th floor you guys can also come and
          watch it if you want might learn a thing or two from it when Jax
          arrived at the arena he sees that his students have already found
          seats amongst the spectators then as his opponent gets on the arena he
          has a smile on his face he is an average built man with one leg then
          the referee says start immediately JX uses his new hatsu and uses en
          to hide his hatsu his opponent uses nen on his fists and tries to
          attack Jax and as soon as he gets close his eyes is just widened and
          plop he falls in the ground when the referee sees this he immediately
          says knock out winner Jacks the audience is confused after all the
          fights in the 200th floor aren't supposed to be over so quickly even
          his students seemed confused at what happened after the fight when he
          goes to his room both Mikasa and kid are confused then kid asks Jax
          what was that ja Dash I mean Sensei how did you defeat him Jax just
          looks at kid and says kid you are around my age having you call me
          Sensei is weird also that was my new hatsu ability then Jax just has a
          playful smile on his face as he jumps up and starts walking on air
          then he starts floating they look even more confused now then Jax just
          points at his eyes and says use goil masasa and kid do so though kids
          goil is a little unsteady and what they see shocked them immensely and
          when they saw it they both thought W what even is that chapter 19 when
          Mikasa and kid used Gio what they see shocked them it was a dragon
          head made out of metal no it was a dragon head made out of countless
          needles kid and Mikasa couldn't help but think amazing there was so
          much Aura in each of those thin needles that it was crazy then Jax
          makes all of the needles disappear this was the ability that he made
          with versatility in mind he didn't put any conditions on it he wants
          to use it as freely as he can even though he didn't get any extra
          Power by not putting any restrictions on it with his strong Aura it is
          quite strong just by itself then just like that 2 months past and Jax
          has fought nine other fights on the 200th floor winning them all and
          becoming a floor Master he didn't get any exp during this time but he
          got very valuable battle experience also he used his ability a lot and
          sometimes even let the fights go on for long just so he can get
          experience using his new hatsu he could use his new ability to fly by
          creating needles in the inside of his shoes or creating a needle
          platform to travel on then Jax thinks of what he could do with his
          abilities I can ever create giant needles for big enemies that will be
          in the Dark Continent when I go there I can also use them as a shield
          or even as a type of manipulation method if I stab someone with a very
          thin needle in the brain and have them call me Sensei and if I have
          also taught them then they will slowly start becoming loyal to me and
          think of i as their savior ready to willingly give their life for me
          this is not a forceful type of manipulation this is a very soft way
          manipulation that is more delicate I can't immediately Force the
          person to be 100% under my control but this ability allows the people
          under my control to grow stronger I called this Gamers piercing this
          is the versatility he was thinking when he created this ability the
          hatsu is also in a way connected to his gamer Powers he has this hatsu
          as an app he needs to click on to use though he can't use two of his
          hatsu at the same time this problem should be fixed once his Aura
          amount raises in level and as a manipulator out of all the other n
          categories manipulators can put the most nen in an object this hatsu
          will grow the more his n amount grows and just like that four more
          months pass Jax becomes 22 years old kid has already gone on a journey
          to find himself where such and Mikasa has gone to take the hunter exam
          he had already put needles in their heads and they are already as
          loyal as they can be this is my countermeasure plan in case he gets a
          n curse or has his nin sealed like Cur Pike did to cwlo how has his
          own people that will go and find him and an exorcist if something like
          this happens then Jax looks at the dinosaur like beast in front of him
          he thinks that if creatures on here are like this how about the
          creatures on the Dark Continent how strong would they be how much exp
          would they even give then as the dinosaur comes towards Jax he just
          simply conjures a couple of giant needles and skewers the dinosaur one
          in the head and the other in the middle of its chest then after that
          Jax goes there and touches the dinosaur's dead body while holding his
          tablet flash then he turned the dinosaur into exp after doing that he
          clicked the stats app and looked at his stats Jax Miller age 22 Talent
          LVL 10320 exp exp 238 St Str LVL 8100 27,800 exp AG LVL 8 248,000 exp
          and LVL 95336 exp n amount LVL 93966 exp he couldn't help it when a
          smile appeared on his face with the gamers piercing hatsu his killing
          ability has skyrocketed he can kill huge numbers of beasts within
          second and he has upgraded his physical stats his men amount is
          growing naturally and currently he is trying to make his physical
          stats at least 10 before he enters another state of forc zetsu after
          all he will be raising his physical stats anyway better do it now than
          later soon after Mikasa and even kid will become Hunters then after
          they gain their own accomplishments they will become one star Hunters
          giving me my ticket to become a two star thinks Jax with a smile on
          after all to become a two star the Hun Hunter needs to have one
          disciple be a one-star Hunter then to become three star one must have
          two or more disciples at one star level Jack has also tried countless
          times hacking the hunter association's websites but even with his
          level 10 talent and learning hacking it was as if someone had given
          his life to hacking if someone really has given his life as a
          condition for some type of hacking like men power then Jax MC POV I
          have no chance to beat hackers like them with just Raw Talent after
          all a life restriction is the strongest and ultimate decision one can
          make while creating an ability and even if I have my stats all 10 or
          even more than that there is no reason to be careless especially in
          this world where raw power isn't everything 3 years later MC AG 25 I
          have now become a two-star hunter my students already made quite a
          name for themselves and now kid is dead the needle was deactivated
          upon his death I had the gamers I Spy on both kid and masika at all
          times during that I saw that he was killed by a certain group of
          people a certain group of people that I know of it is true that he has
          already outlived his usefulness but I did waste a lot of my time on
          him and he was very useful also I kind of want to meet his killers
          they are a truly interesting Bunch chapter 20 cwlo POV I just hear
          nabin Naga and yajin arguing like usual I look at the warehouse around
          us it is a worn out building and a temporary shelter to us it's it's
          also quite far from even the nearest city so this is also a good place
          to hide until our next job the other members are playing cards while
          naanaga and yagin are arguing about the previous game I look at the
          side of the warehouse and on the wall there are countless glass cases
          lined up with each of them filled with Scarlet eyes I got a fancy for
          them when I heard of their beauty they truly are special but I have
          already gotten bored of them we should start selling them we have
          already sold half I wonder what I shall do with the money I guess look
          for a legitimate way to get another Ben's knife that would be useless
          during combat or maybe some ancient book knock knock knock I am
          interrupted from my thought process when I hear a knock on the front
          door I look at Maki and she just shakes her head this Warehouse is
          completely surrounded by strings made from maki's n ability and
          somehow someone got in him I wonder who it is feton just goes and
          opens the Door Creek when the door is opened we see a man drenched in
          Rain he came inside and said oh thanks guys I thought I would be stuck
          outside thank God that there were people here I can't sense any type
          of Aura from him he is completely normal or so he seems he is wearing
          glasses has black hair and brown eyes he is also wearing a black suit
          with a black collar which seems a size too big for him he is around5
          cm tall then I look towards Maki again she has like a sixth sense on
          these things a so-called instinct when I look at her I see something
          strange she is breathing heavily and tears are coming out of her eyes
          what immediately I asked her maky what is wrong she just looks at me
          and says I don't know boss my body can't move I have a chill all over
          I don't know what is going on something is wrong yuin goes to to the
          Intruder and says to him with a serious face sorry we are at full
          capacity pal then feton that was behind the Intruder when he opened
          the door takes out a knife and uses kosu to concentrate his nen at the
          tip of the knife as the knife is going towards the back of the neck of
          the Intruder then plop an arm falls to the ground fet and's arm fell
          to the ground cut off my eyes widen my book appears in my hand I flip
          it to a page I immediately teleport yagin at the unguarded side of the
          Intruder yagin using his Instinct without even thinking he immediately
          punches the Intruder in the kidney as feton grabs his cutof arm and
          jumps back then as yuen's punch lands on the Intruder a red AA is
          concentrated in yin's other fist Big Bang impact we immediately jump
          back to avoid getting in its range Boom the warehouse is completely
          obliterated all of the members are immediately ready for battle they
          are all to my side I have the book on the same page again in use to
          bring yuin back to us but when I bring him back I notice that his
          right arm which he used to attack is completely twisted like a
          Whirlpool Maki on the other hand has a calm face as she uses her
          strings and attaches feton arm back in place as as the smoke and
          debris clear up the rain has stopped falling and we see the figure of
          our attacker his upper clothing is all missing and he has a muscular
          body it seems like he obviously is a monstrously strong opponent even
          above what his musculature might suggest it seems like the last attack
          did no harm to him I just look at our opponent with calm eyes he truly
          is a dangerous enemy Yuen then says I didn't see his Counterattack at
          all we should also be careful of his speed boss then the attacker just
          looks at us and smiles and then he says with a normal soft voice while
          dusting himself ah what a mess you guys are really strong anyway nice
          to meet you all my name is Jax Miller and I must repeat you guys are
          really strong when I look at him I immediately notice a certain tone
          in his voice he is toying with us he has 100% confidence in defeating
          us we should immediately Retreat even if we were able to somehow
          defeat this monster we would lose most of our members we just stay at
          a standstill waiting for him to make the first move MO has already put
          string traps all around the field already in Franklin is ready to
          shoot at any time using his n ability if all of this can even slow him
          enough for Fon FX and bolov to use their abilities they are our Heavy
          Hitters since yin's arm is out of commission then our enemy the
          so-called Jax if that is even his real name says in a completely
          relaxed voice and he even has a smile on his face Sue ladies and
          gentlemen I seem to have lost one of my students his name is kid you
          wouldn't happen to know where he is would you and then when this Jax
          released his Aura boom to me it seemed as if the world turned gray for
          a split second when we felt his Aura it filled me and even the other
          troop members with abject Despair and that was the moment when we all
          understood we need to retreat immediately to even have a chance to
          take down a monster of this caliber you would need an entire nation's
          military author note the MC has finally become so strong that people
          like the Phantom troop are no longer a match to him his Mastery Over N
          all of his basic and advanced men techniques have reached their limits
          also his current stats are Jax Miller age 25 Talent LVL 11064 exp exp
          238 St Str LVL 10 33,200 exp AG LVL 10 33,200 EXP and LVL 101 13,200
          exp n amount LVL 10 83200 ex chapter 21 cwlo POV continuation
          immediately when he released his Aura my body was shaking and couldn't
          move I look at the others and notice that they also couldn't move Maki
          was affected the worst she was on the ground throwing up she had
          calmed down her instincts at first when we met him but now he is
          releasing his nin explosively this isn't about fear of death or
          anything like that we aren't scared of dying Maki is the same too
          death isn't something that we are afraid of what terrifies us all is
          this this monster by the way he has acted until now he will most
          likely torture us to Insanity just for fun I have seen a lot of cruel
          nusers with malicious Aura but I have never seen such a malicious Aura
          my thoughts are all jumbled up right now and my mind is screaming we
          need to run right now but humans are beings who have been able to
          overcome their instincts so I just turned my book to another page but
          suddenly I feel as if time is moving slowly I see that Jax is slowly
          walking towards us I also noticed that the troop got extremely nervous
          I could also feel like I could think faster what is happening I have
          never been able to think so fast during stressful situations suddenly
          I have a realization ah I get it now before death it is said that
          someone's time is complet ressed so I will die anyway if that is the
          case then then I find the ability that I wanted to use my aura flares
          up as I summon then a blue doglike creature with multiple fangs a big
          red nose bulging yellow eyes and a top hat appears into my hand then I
          just tell it while pointing at yagin heal him when yagin sees this he
          already knows what is about to happen so to make it easier he
          forcefully twists his arm back into place with just a silent grunt of
          pain but his fingers and whole arms bones are still shattered but now
          they are at least in the right place so that they can be healed the he
          opens its mouth and spews out water that splashes into yin's arm and
          heals it this is a hatsu ability that I stole from an old man and I am
          lucky that he hasn't died yet and the ability disappeared yuen's arm
          starts to heal back into place and finally it returns back to normal
          fully healed this ability uses stamina to heal but if yagin has one
          thing about him it is his stamina but I also see that yagin is a
          little tired that it means that the injury was truly disastrous it
          probably had more internal bone pulverizing and shredded muscles in
          just less than a second he did this to yagin the most durable amongst
          us is a testament that today might be our last day alive then I look
          at Jax who has stopped releasing his malicious Aura but he still has
          his Reen activated which is enough to keep us from having any
          adventurous thoughts his Aura is massive it feels as if it covers the
          whole world even if the whole spider's Aura amount combined together
          wouldn't even be anywhere near his he also hasn't killed us yet so why
          is that he just keeps looking at us with a strange smile on his face
          and then he says quite the good ability you have there it must be a
          type of hatsu stealing ability for you to be able to use two
          categories like that one from a mission with the little dog and the
          previous one with the teleportation but I guess that must also clear
          some conditions before you must be able to steal an ability maybe four
          or five conditions before you can steal an ability the conditions must
          also be quite harsh for such an ability the more he speaks the more
          nervous we all become he just managed to figure out my ability so fast
          even his thought process is scary truly terrifying we definitely won't
          be able to escape him one looks is all he needed for him to figure out
          my ability I have never met someone like this the monster just calmly
          keeps walking towards us until he is 10 m in front of us and then he
          stops what are his intentions if we have killed his student he could
          have killed us whenever he wanted but why didn't he do it is he lying
          about the student and just attacking us for fun no he doesn't need to
          lie he could have just attacked us and massed us all within an instant
          so that means that he didn't necessarily care about his student and
          more likely just found us for fun he seems like that type of person or
          maybe he isn't but I definitely know something 100% that we will all
          die if we fight him our chance is to Escape are all slim to none if we
          fight him we die if we run we also die what should I do no I need to
          stay calm it doesn't matter if even most of the spiders die as long as
          the troop is alive that is all that matters but how do I deal with a
          monster like this while all of the troop members are on guard I notice
          the monster smile at us know he is smiling at me specifically like he
          already knows what I am thinking I keep racking my brain on how to
          solve this disaster that has fallen upon us how just how do I solve
          this maybe because of my stress or fear I finally got an idea I just
          closed my book and got rid of the heate then I just put my hands in
          the air and said to the monster in human skin I give up so how about
          we become your underlings this is the best action possible to ensure
          our survival then JX just seems to think a bit and like he got an idea
          with a cruel smile on his face he says H chapter 22 then with a cruel
          smile on his face Jax answered to me you are all weakling so you would
          be useless as subordinates how about this you spar with me and if I
          find you fun and entertaining you can live if not then you will die
          simple right this is better he could have just refused I was even kind
          of expecting him to refuse he obviously has some negative intentions
          but as long as the spider survives it doesn't matter I also decide to
          ask him another question also if theoretically we were to lose would
          our deaths be quick and if you were to torture someone I ask that it
          be me there is no need to put the people in the Phantom troop who
          aren't good with pain into a situation like this Jack still with the
          same happy smile on his face says to us it depends really I might
          decide to have my way with the girls while you watch or kill you and
          have fun with the girls while they look at your corpses or maybe
          torture some spiders while you watch or do both who knows honestly it
          depends on what mood I am but don't worry I will kill you all at the
          end of the day if that happens your pain won't last too long I knew it
          a monster without any qualms about what is right and wrong I see some
          of the troop members shaking in anger or is it fear well it doesn't
          matter either way better get started as I open my book Bandit secret
          again we are about to start the so-called Spar but Jax just looks at
          us with a confused look on his face by the way why are you guys so
          scared when I threaten to torture and kill you all you know that if
          you kill someone you really should expect to you yourself be treated
          the same way didn't you like Massacre a whole clan or something
          recently from the elderly to the last child man you guys are just
          confusing sometimes liar you could read us all along you have probably
          figured out some of the troop members personalities I can definitely
          tell that he has read some of the troop members like an open book
          though I don't say that out loudly no need to anger him to go all out
          and there is a slim chance of victory Jack's with that smile who has
          already gotten way too creepy in my opinion the smile is just too wide
          so then just start whenever you feel ready he says with a casual and
          even slightly bored look on his face immediately we all get in
          position I can't use the teleportation ability anymore since it has a
          cool down so I will go with another Foo we all used aren and most
          activated their hatsu Franklin attacked first by detaching his
          fingertips and using his nin bullets Jax easily Dodges them then yagin
          goes for an attack towards Jax's skull flash but as yuen's attack is
          about to land plop his arm falls on the ground then swish yuen's other
          limbs are also all cut up I didn't see anything no movement from Jax I
          am already using Goo so no tricks either we will need to end this
          fight quickly or he will die from blood loss Maki then throws thin
          needles with strings attached to them Jax also dodged them easily but
          then Maki used her strings to trap him by tying him up and he still
          has a smile on his face as if he can easily break out of there and we
          know he can but I open my book and go towards another ability and then
          I point towards Jax the air around Jax gets heavier this will only
          last for 30 seconds but that is enough as finx appears behind Jax and
          he winds his arm backwards one more time he has already done 47
          rotations boom and it hits Jax in the back of his head shaer then
          appeared in front of him with an antenna ready to poke him in his eyes
          where there shouldn't be any defenses but as expected Jax's aren is
          too monstrous and the antenna doesn't even touch Jacks then we all
          jump back feten picks up yin's body and Maki puts him back together
          then bonolenov comes and conjures a sphere around himself he conjures
          a sphere that looks like planet Jupiter around himself and it attempts
          to crush Jax I noticed that Jax was still smiling and then he flash
          easily gets out of his restraint and the heavy air around himself then
          he just holds one hand up and catches Jupiter boom We immediately jump
          back from the crash radius I see that Jax comes out of the crater
          while holding up Jupiter with one arm he just smiles and throws it
          towards us but banol laav just dispelled Jupiter and he landed in
          front of us nabin Naga then takes this chance and Drew his sword and
          ran towards Jax and he used KO and slashed with all his power towards
          Jax's neck King but the monster caught it just using two fingers and
          he stopped the sword from moving we are all covered in cold sweat we
          literally threw towards him our strongest attacks but it didn't work
          then Jax just looks at us and he released his bloodlust and Flash he
          disappeared ah then I hear some members scream and as I turn around I
          see that Franklin shauk and cupi they were instantly knocked out and
          even some of their limbs cut off flash next thing I know my body is
          falling down what then I see that I have also had my right arm cut off
          I guess he will kill us then I look at Maki and see she is being held
          by the throat by Jack the others either had their limbs cut off or
          were knocked out Feen was one of the members that was knocked out then
          the monster just said you know what chapter 23 Jack MC POV I just look
          at the Phantom Troop All in the ground so Hoka hasn't joined the
          spiders yet well that is a shame I would have liked to see his
          expression would he be like the other members I look at them they are
          all scared some of them are even shaking their bodies won't move from
          Fear I look at the one I am holding by the throat maky she seems to be
          struggling to try and break my grip on her throat I can see her eyes
          are all bloodshot and the veins around her neck convulsing I could
          have killed them all under one second before they could even react I
          would cut off all of their heads even though my usage of n is the best
          in this continent but I haven't met someone who would even force me to
          use more than my raw power my raw power is out of this world even
          though my stats are about Mor's level I am still stronger than him
          when he fought Neo he just uses and throws his power around like a
          child but me I can control my muscles to stop bleeding and make my
          defense even stronger I know martial arts to such a high level level
          that even if some people gave their life to martial arts they wouldn't
          be able to have even 1% of my usage of it what takes them a century to
          learn I can do so in a year I have so many combat oriented hatus for
          every environment because of my high Aura I didn't even put any
          restrictions on most of them and they still came out monstrous I
          remember that it used to be hard for me to even use nen in general but
          now I do it with as much difficulty as I breathe and walk anyway
          enough daydreaming I look at Maki her eyes have already rolled on the
          back of her skull and she is unconscious but still alive sigh I just
          let her go and she drops down I see the other members have a strange
          relief in their eyes they are smart so they know what me letting maky
          go means I am not going to kill them and I won't torture them then I
          just conjure 13 needles and throw them in the ground they are very
          thin needles barely seen by the normal eye and they are as long as a
          normal finger when the Phantom troop sees this they have questioning
          looks but I know that they don't dare to say anything after all they
          do think that they are hanging on a very thin rope but the truth is I
          never really was going to kill them I would like to keep them around
          as entertainment they can play my little game so I just start walking
          away as the sun sets in the background and then while walking away I
          say to them with a soft voice but I know they heard it insert these
          needles into your head then then I started walking away when I said
          that they all understood that wasn't a request it was an order and
          some of them are a little too panicked to think this through clearly
          well they could decide to not put the needles in their heads and to
          the ones who don't I will hunt them down and kill them they know that
          so they are very careful I should go back to some ruins and learn some
          more about the Dark Continent since I don't have a lot of information
          on it from the manga I have started going through many ancient ruins
          and learned some very useful information for example the Dark
          Continent doesn't have a marum level monster at every corner though it
          does have something even more Troublesome giant animals poisoned
          environments creatures with special abilities that raw power is
          useless against some of them I understand why Meto said that there was
          no battle in the Dark Continent only survival but for me the dark
          continent is like a delicious sheep just waiting to be slaughtering
          one year later Mikasa POV age 17 I just look around the coffee shop it
          is a homey place in this small town there is a small wind in the town
          I am wearing a brown short jacket with a white shirt under it and a
          red scarf then I see that one of the waiters a young girl with
          beautiful blue hair that reaches to her back her blue eyes full of
          tenderness locked into my black coal eyes I must say that she truly is
          a beautiful thing then the waitress just asked me with a voice full of
          excitement how can I help you Miss I just look at her and say with my
          usual calm face on and then I say can I get some iced tea she just
          nods and says right away miss when she started walking away after
          finishing the iced tea and paying for it I go outside then as I am
          about to go outside of the coffee shop I just call the cute waitress
          back again she asks me if I need anything then with a small blush on
          my cheeks and an embarrassed voice I asked her you seem like a nice
          person s so would you like to go out with me sometimes she seems a
          little conflicted and Confused then with a reluctant voice she says uh
          sure just meet me after my shift is over at 8:00 also even though you
          are a pretty girl and probably you learn from some of my costumers
          that I am into girls too anyway I want the date to be in a public area
          not some dark alley I smiled towards her and then left then I after it
          gets dark and her shift is over me and alinity the waitress went on a
          date after the date we were outside of the city in an old castle where
          the stars looked beautiful from here even though she said that we
          wouldn't go into places where no people are now that she has gotten
          close to me and knows me a little better she decided to bring me here
          then as we are sitting on the edge of one of the outer walls in the
          castle alinity looks towards me and is about to say something when
          cough she coughs up blood and falls down from the wall hitting the
          ground and breaking her neck immediately mediately I am on full alert
          and look around then I immediately activate my hatsu chapter 24 Mikasa
          POV continuation when I see that my date has fallen down I immediately
          look around I can't sense anything or anyone damn it I better use my
          hats suit just to be safe fou a giant teddy bear costume is conjured
          around my body the bear is wearing a top hat it has hands like humans
          made out of metal then I used Ken and my aura concentrated into a
          dense defense with my dense High Aura I can count the people that I
          know who can get through my defense with one finger together with the
          defense from my hatsu even from someone very powerful it should be
          quite hard to injure in just one attack I smell the air and I can't
          smell anyone even if they use zetsu I am able to use my enhanced sense
          of smell to locate them this just became dangerous I should summon my
          gun and knife as I am about to do so someone comes from behind a wall
          in the castle when I see that face those glasses and that black suit
          who seems one size too big I immediately recognized who it was it was
          Sensei whom I can't sense anything from actually now that I really
          concentrated on him specifically he seems like a normal person did he
          lose his n somehow or this isn't really Sensei I didn't let my guard
          down and said with my voice which now because of my hat Sue it is
          blurred and sounds like a growl tell me something only Jack's Sensei
          would know I see him just have a smile on his face ha had definitely
          got that down at least he just raised his hands in a surrendering way
          and he said that girl that I killed wasn't your real lover was she she
          was just your target you have really become a good Blacklist Hunter
          mikaso I just narrowed my eyes and said I said say something that only
          Sensei would know he just released a tired and said when you were
          young you always like my cooking you also used your favorite toy that
          I gave you to create your hatsu also when you were young one time when
          you walk I immediately interrupted what he was about to say okay okay
          I believe you he doesn't need to say embarrassing things like that so
          he definitely is Jack's Sensei sigh I just sit down and say to Sensei
          why did you have to do that you could have come out and identified
          yourself sooner I wouldn't have had to summon my hatsu he just smiles
          and Flash he appears next to me he is also sitting down I didn't see
          him move at all he has gotten even stronger he crossed around 30 m in
          a split second he also knows that when I summon this hatsu of mine I
          put a condition on it that when summoned I cannot take it off for 24
          hours when he sits down next to me he just casually says something
          shocking I am planning to go to the dark continent in the future as
          soon as he said that my body shakes a little he always talked a lot
          about the Dark Continent but I never thought he would want to go to it
          he always said that it was a dangerous place with the chance of
          survival below 1% I just look at him I don't want Sensei to die he is
          the person who gave me freedom and took me away from a place that can
          only be described as hell I would have died or be raped multiple times
          by now if it wasn't for sensei I can't let him go to the Dark
          Continent I can't let him die he is my most precious person in this
          world I would give my life for him but why would he want to go to that
          place it does have things that would be able to revolutionize the
          human world as we know it but I know that Sensei doesn't care for the
          human race so even though I know the dreaded answer but even though I
          knew I just wanted to hear a different answer so I asked the question
          to Sensei but Sensei why would you want to even go there he just looks
          into my eyes and says I have almost reached my limit here the growth
          that I experience is minimal my power has started stagnating so I must
          go to a place where I can become stronger I always knew it Sensei no
          not Sensei the person Jax has always been seeking an absolute power
          even though he didn't say it out loud his obsession with power is
          abnormal even while teaching me he was always also non-stop training
          himself to become stronger he had has fought a countless number of
          beasts just to try ABD Rouse his fighting experience and strength then
          my big teddy behead just looks down and I ask another question again
          when are you planning to go to the Dark Continent he just answers
          casually well I am currently 26 years old so I will wait until I am in
          my 30s to go there after all I need to prepare some things tears come
          out of my eyes inside my suit while I ask him my last question and for
          what reason did you come here he just lies down on the Cold Stone as
          he looks at the stars then he just extends his hand Towards the Sky
          while saying I don't have a lot of people that I care for in this
          world not even my birth parents but I might die in the Dark Continent
          so I just wanted to let you know and warn you to not follow me if I
          die on there I have never said it out loud but my dream is to become
          the strongest creature in the world I have started stagnating lately
          and I hate that in around half a decade I probably won't get any
          stronger so I just wanted you to go and live your own life I saved you
          but you don't owe me anything I want you to have a family and be happy
          maybe name a kid after me that would be nice then he gets up with his
          usual smile not on his face then he says with a serious voice this
          might be the last time we meet so while walking away he waves towards
          me bye-bye when he said that I got up and wanted to say something to
          him just say something but I couldn't so I fell down on my knees bam
          hitting the rock floor below me and breaking it emotions that I
          haven't felt in a long time formed in my chest absolute sadness and
          despair I was about to lose the person I care most about in this world
          not only someone that was my teacher he was also my father brother
          Mother and everything else he was my world tears wouldn't stop flowing
          from my eyes knowing that he would be walking to his own death my
          sadness was giving me physical pain as I felt as if my my heart was
          about to burst I couldn't help it as a cry of Despair came out of my
          throat damn it chapter 25 3 years later gone freaks POV as we walked
          away from the hotel where zi's Master explained us those mental
          techniques when we go outside I just hear kilua say with a neutral
          voice he was lying there is no way that a mental technique could do
          that he probably means that there is no way a mental technique helps
          resist his attacks after that we arrive at the 200th floor we are in a
          hallway and as we are about to go forward we see a floor clerk she is
          a young woman who much like all the other Heavens Arena staff dresses
          in the standard Heavens Arena referee uniform she has shoulder length
          hair sleepy eyes and wears nail polish when we are about to walk
          forward flash a murderous Aura comes forward we just look at the clerk
          in front of us is she doing it then the clerk says you need to
          register in for the 200th floor before midnight but then out of the
          corner another person comes Hoka he just steps forward and stands
          behind the clerk the clerk turned around and was startled when she saw
          Hoka behind her then Hoka just said remember when you ordered Airship
          tickets off the cybernet I found you from there really should be more
          careful with stuff like that he goes and sits down at the end of the
          hallway he just looks at us with a smile on his face while saying you
          guys aren't ready for the 200th floor yet boom his Aura of bloodlust
          comes towards us it immobilized us completely kilua can't move at all
          but I push forward I can feel a type of heaviness in my heart as I try
          to walk forward some more then flash I feel someone touch my shoulder
          the blood lust is is canceled Hoka just licks his lips as his smile
          turns evil I turn around and see a beautiful woman with black hair and
          pilous black eyes behind me she has a completely blank face then with
          a cold voice she says you shouldn't push your body like that or you
          might die then her eyes look at Hoka then she says with a calm voice
          like always just going after kids Hoka Hoka just keeps smiling while
          saying amikasa truly amazing I didn't even sense you would you like to
          stay in my room as soon as Hoka said that to the one called Mikasa her
          expression didn't change at all as she said go dye you piece of sht
          Hoka just sigh and acts sad ah how cruel of you to say that then
          Mikasa and Hoka just stare at one another with clear animosity between
          them then suddenly another voice says I hope that you learn that you
          aren't ready yet for the next level kilua Ken gone Ken then I see that
          it was Wing San immediately kilua just turned towards Wing San and
          with a little anger in his voice he said this is n he is able to
          physically stop us from walking forward with just willpower that is
          true there is no way men is just some type of mental technique Wing
          just smiled at us and then grabbed both me and kilowa by our shoulders
          and nudged us to go outside when we went outside he just said I will
          teach you guys nen when I heard this I was happy but kilua just looked
          at him suspiciously and asked wing and why would you decide to teach
          us n now wing just sigh and says to them people who go to the 200th
          floors unprepared at best he or she will lose one of their limbs the
          power levels compared to the lower floors it is completely different
          someone with men hitting someone without it can cause catastrophic
          damage and I don't want two kids like you to have that fate so I will
          teach you n kilua just looked at him and said what can you offer us I
          am sure that lady called Mikasa would teach us too Wing just gets a
          worried look on his face while saying I am not really sure you would
          even survive her training she doesn't teach the traditional way she
          just throws impossible challenges and expects her students to be able
          to live through them her current student just to get accepted as her
          student she had to fight on the 200th floor killu a POV Wing S I am
          pretty sure I could survive it it is not arrogance or anything like
          that but my family is way worse then Wing San just sigh and says you
          shouldn't be associated with her I heard some rumors that she is
          looking for someone and she has killed people just for small amounts
          of information gone just listen to this and can't help but have a
          curious Gaze on his eyes so he asks I wonder who she is looking for
          Wing just smiled at that and said well I heard that it was her teacher
          the one who taught her nen his name is Jax or something I don't know a
          lot about him just that he is a three-star Hunter there are only a
          handful of those it means that he is accomplished in multiple Fields
          there are even some books that are written about him then Wing San
          stopped talking when we arrived at his apartment but he still said
          with a serious voice I don't want you guys to worry too much about
          other stuff today you need to concentrate on your nen that I will
          awaken chapter 26 Hoka POV I just threw another card on the wall and
          the card pierced the wall there were dozens of cards that I had
          already thrown I just need to wait for Gan and kilowa to finish
          learning their nen Gan already instinctively knows how to use zetsu he
          did so at the hunter exam when he took my badge he should definitely
          have the talent to learn n before midnight and kilua alumi always says
          that kilua is the most talented member of the zoric family and my
          instincts say the same he definitely is as talented as gone I can't
          wait until they grow up so I can break them I should also try to
          instigate a fight with Mikasa I don't know her hatsu since she never
          used it on any of her fights to become a floor master in Heaven's
          Arena though I do know that she is famous for her monstrous strength
          and mastery of all the N techniques basic and advanced she can use
          them all with pinpoint Precision but doesn't fight anymore since she
          is already a floor master and is known to be in the top tier of the
          floor master so there is not going to be any challenges against her
          also I believe that after training her current student she will most
          likely be gone from here and I will lose my chance to fight her maybe
          if I kill her student she would become angry enough to fight me then
          as I am thinking these things I sense two auras from the corner appear
          in front of me me aan and kilua I knew it their Aura also seems to be
          controlled now that shows that they have got the hang of 10 not
          letting their AA leak away as they start walking towards me and I
          while sitting down I just release my Reen on them but they with the
          help of their 10 are able to pass through when they can finally walk
          through the hallway they arrive in front of me I just keep smiling at
          them and say welcome to the 200th floor it seems you will be able to
          pass without undergoing a baptism just by looking at gan's face I am
          able to determine what they are here for I can guess what is the
          reason that brought you here Gan your intention was to confront me
          after training in here wasn't it I see Gan frown and say the only
          thing I couldn't have expected was to see you here this just makes it
          easier for me to win he must really be an enhancer I just laugh a
          little he he he you have become quite confident since you acquired nen
          then I point a finger up and form my men into a heart and then a skull
          and hide it with I in I see that they haven't noticed it yet so they
          don't know gyo or anything more advanced than that then I just stop
          using I in to hide my men and they can finally see the shapes while
          looking at their slightly surprised faces I just say n is quite deep
          and complicated then I got up and started walking away to speak so
          arrogantly as you are right now I don't want to fight against against
          you then I turn back and look at them one more time and say come out
          Victorious from one fight on this floor and only then will I fight you
          I then walk away as I do so I see three people one in a wheelchair one
          with only one arm and the other without any legs pathetic they only
          fight against rookies in he truly weaklings that will never become
          stronger in their lives as I am walking towards my room in the tower I
          see a little girl around 12 years old past me she has orange hair and
          is wearing a blue dress she seems to be holding a tub of vanilla ice
          cream her name is iie the student of Mikasa even though she is the
          same age as gone and kilua her Ora is more compact than them she has
          been learning men for quite some time should I kill her now that would
          guarantee a fight with masasa that would be fun as I turn around and
          go towards Little iie I slowly take out a card but suddenly I feel a
          dangerous feeling coming from behind me I immediately turn around and
          throw my card towards the danger when I clearly see what the danger
          was I see Mikasa she just dodged my card that I threw then the card
          pierced the wall behind her H interesting the card which is stuck in
          the wall with the help of my rubbery men bounces back from the wall
          gaining a higher velocity towards mikasa's back she just like always
          simply has a cold look on her face as she just takes out two small
          knives out of her Pockets she throws one towards me and with the other
          she just turns around and just pierced my card with it and with a
          swirl before her first knife even reached me she turned around towards
          me and threw the other knife with my card towards me also smart she
          was able to read my mind in a second then as both of her knives are
          coming towards me I just used nen and grab them but still I can feel
          two deep Cuts in my palm that is quite some men in these knives a
          smile appears in my face as I say well hello there Mikasa but with a
          cold voice she just says you are dead Hoka yep it seems like she
          discovered what I was thinking and was about to attack her student
          when I feel her violent Reen appear and I can feel a Tremor in the air
          I just lick my lips a little I got hard just from sensing her when her
          cold look her powerful aura that surgical control that she has over
          her Aura a I think I am in love chapter 27 Mikasa POV I just look at
          Hoka his face doesn't really hide what he is feeling Jack's always
          said that if you aren't 100% sure that you can defeat your enemy then
          go for the kill Hoka has never really hidden his hatsu sometimes he
          even says what abilities it had I don't know if he maybe has a
          condition that makes his n more powerful when he explains his hatsu or
          what but I do know one thing for sure Hoka is definitely a difficult
          opponent for me his bunge gum is very tricky to deal with so I just
          use Ari and my aura explodes I have a higher amount of Aura than Hoka
          but that means pretty much nothing in an then battle and our
          difference isn't that big though he already is at a disadvantage he
          carelessly caught my knives and cut his hands I acted like I took
          those from my pockets but in reality I conjured them since I wasn't in
          my bare suit this hatsu of mine that is like an in curse didn't fully
          apply the unhealing curse that doesn't allow any injuries given by my
          knife to heal at all those small Cuts in his hands will take around a
          month to even start showing signs of healing plus I am not alone iie
          my little student though she is weak in comparison she can definitely
          give an edge in the battle after a single opening between combatants
          of our level is enough to decide the battle iie just has a calm
          expression and looks at me I just nod at her since Hoka has his back
          towards her turn his front towards me he can't escape from here then
          Hoka just calms down he looks behind him and then at me again puts his
          hands up and says how about we leave this for the ring I still keep my
          guards up and my look gets even colder I am not going to fight him if
          there is no benefit to me so I just say okay then we both relax our n
          then I just say iy come here iy just just looks a little confused and
          scared while saying sure Sensei then as she is coming towards me I
          observe Hoka like a hawk as soon as he tries acting suspiciously I
          will attack it would take half a second to fully activate my hatsu and
          Go full power then iie just came towards me having forgotten about her
          ice cream the ice cream already fell on the ground as soon as H sooka
          tried to attack her then when we reach my room I can finally breathe a
          sigh of Rel Lea Hoka would have died if we fought but iie would also
          have a high chance to die too he is a maniac and his actions
          unpredictable I just look at iie who has a scared look on her face
          even though she didn't say anything in front of Hoka she was
          definitely scared of him then I just Pat her head and say don't worry
          my little doll I will protect you and even though I said that with my
          usual monotone voice iie still had a bright smile on her face she just
          suddenly hugged me you are the best Sensei I couldn't help as a small
          smile appeared on my face also we will be moving to a new place a
          place where even though I didn't go there Sensei used to say that it
          is perfect for helping people learn Advanced and techniques then I
          feel Ary hugg me even tighter while saying I love you Sensei when she
          said that my cold face that only had a small smile morphed into a
          bright smile if people who knew me saw this they would say that it
          looked strange on my face I wonder is this what Jax felt when he took
          me in though I wasn't as affectionate as iie saigh when that thought
          comes into my head I can't help but think about Jacks he hasn't been
          seen anywhere during these last couple of years there hasn't been a
          clue to where he is then I suddenly hear iie say by the way Sensei
          where is this place that will help me learn in better my face goes
          back to my ual monotone look as I say well the name of the place is
          called Greed Island general POV during this time in the Deep darkness
          of the ocean where light can't even reach anymore where only the
          strongest of underwater creatures those who can handle this type of
          water pressure can live a strange sight can be seen in there a youngl
          looking man who seems to only be around his early 20s he was just
          punching and kicking the water all around him and his punches and
          kicks seem blurry most of the time the ripples around him are keeping
          away the creatures that were looking at him with predatory eyes
          suddenly he just stops in place and looks around him even though no
          light comes to this place he just sigh as if noticing the creatures
          that had him surrounded then a strange Aura came out of him boom as if
          the sky had started falling an even heavier pressure than the bottom
          of the ocean descended the giant fish that could swallow ship's hole
          just stop stopped moving they had died just from feeling the aura of
          this person then the person's terrifying aura that was darker than
          Darkness just receded back into his body as if it was all just a
          pigment of the imagination all along he had killed dozens of these
          giant creatures that had lived in this dangerous dark pit their whole
          lives and they were one of the most dangerous Beasts of the human
          continent they had all died just like that from fear and simply the
          raw power of His Aura the guy whose appearance can't be seen but he
          just fash faster than most fish known to humankind he swam forward and
          in a blink arrived in front of his victims then he touched them with
          one hand and a tablet appeared on his other hand when he does that all
          of these these giant creatures disappeared one by one after this the
          person just looks up and he Foo the water around him trembled as he
          swam upwards creating numerous waves on his wake in 7 seconds he
          arrived at the surface of the water his black hair was all soggy and
          his brown eyes were closed then he opened them they squinted for a
          split second he just looked around and thought Canon should have
          already started he then pointed his hand up and poof a floating big
          chest appeared in front of him then he pulls out a wooden boat out of
          the chest something that should be impossible to do due to the chest
          size then he climbed on the boat and he started pulling out clothes
          more specific speically a stylish black suit with a black tie then he
          put on some glasses as he does so he takes a breath of fresh air and
          smiles I haven't had to breathe for a month since I was underwater as
          expected it still feels more natural than holding my breath for months
          then he pulled out a phone from his box and he called someone and when
          they picked up he said hi there I am Jack Miller and I need a boat at
          the middle of the ocean actually just follow my phone signal he moved
          quite a bit underwater during his training so he isn't exactly sure
          where he even is chapter 28 two months later General POV yuin just
          like a madman kills the mafia members who have numerically weapons he
          looks like a caveman killing ants also from far away Kapa Melody and
          the rest of the no straight family guards just look at this with a
          little fear in their hearts they had never seen an end user of this
          caliber bullets and even Rockets are nothing against him and there are
          even more monsters who should be around this level just playing cards
          after that the shadow beasts come but they are all defeated by yuin
          but he is still paralyzed from the poison men Foo a chain comes out of
          nowhere and grabs yuin right before the eyes of the other troop
          members all of this was happening while a human covered in darkness
          looked at them it was Jax he was just looking at all of this with a
          smile on his face and some popcorn as if this was all just some great
          show to him when he saw kpa's chains the first thing he thought was
          weaker than expected sure they would be able to hold down people as
          strong as yagin but I would be able to break through in less than a
          second around zero 1 seconds man I really have gotten stronger I can't
          wait to go to the Dark Continent while contemplating this Jack Still
          kept following kurapika's little gang who just rode away with yuin he
          just kept running casually and was easily able to keep up with them
          this is really fun seeing them in real life is way better than the
          anime amusedly thought Jax then he decided to stop and wait for the
          Phantom troop those guys are way more fun than these I will also see
          how the battle with the rest of the Shadow beasts is like Jax just
          looked at them as Al just uses his conjured cloth to try and trap the
          Phantom troop members in the car since naaga was sitting in the middle
          in the back seat when the others jumped out he couldn't decide fast
          enough which side to jump so he got taken okay so the fight was really
          one-sided not because the shadow beasts had bad abilities or anything
          like that it was just simply arrogance and hot-headedness honestly
          their hatus weren't even that bad but as expected within minutes they
          got slaughtered only owl the one that can conjure a cloth that reduces
          someone's size and weight truly a nice ability that one if he trained
          for a couple of decades he would become really strong a top level
          Hunter that ability also has pretty good defensive properties thought
          Jax with a disappointed look on his face just like that he followed
          them to an abandoned building where feton tortured owl the other
          members were in another room just relaxing that is when Jax decided to
          walk into the building as soon as Jax got into the second floor where
          the others were maki's body immediately started shaking nabin Naga
          just looked at her with a frown and asked what is wrong Maki Maki had
          a nervous look on her face her body drenched in cold sweat her
          instincts screaming I see can f feel his P person H he is close T to
          us stuttered Maki even though she wasn't on the floor throwing up and
          screaming like the first time she met him her Instinct still warned
          her of someone way out of their leagues is nearby that Monster is here
          in this building thought nauna together with the others with that
          memory of that night resurfacing fiton was still torturing Al but even
          he stopped even from the other room with his Keen hearing he just
          heard what the others said then they all heard clap clap clap some
          slow claps coming from the darkness of the hallway shizuku shelar Maki
          and nabin Naga can't help but feel fear as their worst nightmare comes
          out of the Shadows I must say your intuition is truly terrifying Maki
          it's like you have a sixth sense though I must say seeing a girl
          become with just from my presence raised my self-esteem said Jax with
          a smile on his face commenting about Maki being covered in cold sweat
          naaga even though he is scared for himself he puts his hand on the
          handle of his Katana while saying what is it that you need we already
          have your needles in our skulls there would be no need for you to find
          us Jax just smiled and raised his hands up to show that he is harmless
          wow you guys have gotten stronger now I must say that is really scary
          when they saw his actions they just couldn't help but think that this
          monster really likes to bullsh Too Much Jack's POV I just look at them
          all this is fun having power like this truly the only threat to my
          life on this continent would be nanica or post nuk marum but sadly
          none of them are available currently and I am not willing to mess with
          nanica since her fighting Power by herself is close to none but
          anyways better concentrate in the fun stuff going on in front of me
          when I see that none of the Phantom troop reply to me I just shrug my
          shoulders well I guess you guys are humble and all that that is nice
          being humble is very good anyway I have nothing better to do so I will
          be following you guys around all of them immediately have worried
          looks on their faces wow talk about being a bad host but anyway I just
          told them reassuringly don't worry I won't don't interfere with
          anything you guys do I will just be an observer having fun even while
          saying all this I have a bright smile on my face a smile a day keeps
          the depression away or so they say shaar feton nabin Naga and Maki
          sighed in relief at this man am I really that scary to them I try to
          think back on the things that I have done to them that could make them
          so afraid of me while I guess I can see where they are coming from
          they are forced to reluctantly accept I am currently watching them
          from afar as they free yichin how lucky Kapa is for him to not be here
          he is meeting with hissoka and he is probably already planning on how
          to take out yagin a battle between n Fighters is very complicated
          knowing your opponent's abilities is such a huge Advantage actually in
          most n fights knowing your enemy's ability is the main reason you
          would win against your opponent even though lately my raw power has
          reached such a stage that I don't really even need to try and I would
          EAS IL kill my opponent under 02 seconds if he was near me at a 50 m
          radius without even needing to use nen anyway now things should start
          getting interesting next day and they did get interesting everything
          went almost like Cannon I am actually looking at the fight against
          Kapa and yuin this was awesome and entertaining as hell though I
          forgot to bring some popcorn so that is a bummer after the fight I
          just looked as Kapa buried juin that guy really just brought a shovel
          to a fight I couldn't stop laughing when I returned back to the
          Phantom troop Hideout like usual it was another abandoned building
          outside of the city I saw that all of the members of The Troop were
          there it also seems like we have some new members in the troop General
          POV cwlo was the first to have the guts to ask Jax did juin fight the
          chain user and is he alive Jax just Shrugged and a smile appeared on
          his face come on now I can't tell you that you must solve the mystery
          by yourself sorry but you ain't getting no spoilers from me when Jack
          said that nabin naga's grip on the handle of the sword so tightly that
          vain started appearing on his bands he was angry but he knew that he
          couldn't attack Jax or he knew what would happen he would be killed by
          Jax before he could even blink so he had to breathe deeply to try get
          rid of the anger inside of him while this was happening the Phantom
          troop members were too concentrated on Jax to notice that Hoka had a
          totally different look on his face his eyes were wide open and a
          psychotic smile appeared on his face he truly couldn't sense any men
          from the person casually talking to the Phantom troop members but then
          suddenly Jax turned and looked at Hoka he just smiled at him chapter
          29 while gathered here with all of them I just looked towards Hoka and
          smiled that is quite the creepy smile that you have clown kuen Hoka
          doesn't answer he just gets up and is about to walk towards me but FX
          immediately just says Hoka don't or you will get us all killed
          hisoka's eyes widened at this and he looked towards crlo and the
          others to confirm this crlo just opened a book to read after that he
          confirmed thinks is WR Hoka you would get all of us killed Hoka wasn't
          dumb enough to not listen to their advice so went back and sat down on
          his place interesting so even he has common sense I honestly thought
          that he would have a sixth sense and be able to tell the difference in
          power between us then I just Shrugged and went to sit down on one
          corner I pulled out a game console and started playing an old style
          RPG I love those games there is a reason my hatsu is so effective N is
          a representation of themselves and my power represents my love for
          power in games next day I just woke up I had fallen asleep while
          playing video games I went toward York New City and looked around for
          anything interesting I like interesting things I also really should go
          and look at any new games around and keep them around to spend time I
          mean until the Chimera ants come around everything else will be
          relatively borish well not borish but more like there will literally
          be nothing that can even give me a decent fight I decided to take a
          coffee as I saw nabin Naga and Maki sitting like they are on a date
          but they were really trying to find out who is following them which is
          gone and kilua they are hiding in a building a block away while using
          zetsu to hide their nen I just take a sip of the coffee Dam this
          tastes pretty good with the sun shining on me and the cute waitress
          looking at me hey who knows maybe I will get a date tonight while I am
          thinking that I sense gone and kilua just got found out and go on a
          possible date or have fun enjoying the cannon timeline and look at the
          arm wrestling match between abaga and Gan H well the girl probably
          won't [ __ ] me on the first date but maybe she will give me a BJ yeah
          I guess I will have to go with looking at the cool match between Gan
          and nabin Naga so I went and watched the arm wrestling obviously
          hiding from all of the other troop members even Maki can't sense me I
          obviously let her sense the previous time if I couldn't even trick a
          simple Instinct then that would be pretty lame of me but as expected
          Don lost and when he beat na naga in that one match and said that if
          they cared about each other why can't the Phantom troop spare some of
          those tears for the Innocence that they killed obviously Fen got angry
          and was about to break gan's arm but naaga took a liking to Gan since
          he was straightforward like yagin but before nabin Naga could say
          anything I walked forward from the Shadows that I was hiding my shoes
          tapping on the ground and making noise as I just smiled and clapped
          clap clap I looked towards gone and my smile widened truly marvelous
          little kid if you train constantly for around three decades you might
          be someone worth fighting against gone just looked at me who are you
          glasses guy I just smiled I still wear the glasses even though I don't
          need them anymore my glasses reflect the Moonlight as I mysteriously
          said well now that would be wrong to give my name away like that maybe
          one day when you strong enough I will tell you where Jing is gone k he
          he he Flash and I disappeared in front of their Icees at least from
          their point of view from my point of view I just casually jogged
          towards the city honestly this was boring maybe I really should have
          asked that cute waitress on a date H maybe I should go to that place
          Greed Island obviously going through the regular channels would be
          boring so I am going to find where Greed Island is on the real world I
          just sigh a little and summon my tablet there are a lot of new apps on
          it the screen is full of them then I capped the app called compass app
          and a compass appeared on the screen of the tablet the compass was
          pointing East well then that is where Greed Island should be though it
          doesn't show the distance so that is a bummer but my hatsu is already
          beyond amazing it can locate any person or place as long as I know its
          name and what I am looking for for days later and here I am swimming
          in the middle of the ocean while looking at the slight House of an
          island I start swimming towards the island when I reach it I can feel
          a N Signal trying to locate me but I just completely silence my nin
          and walk on the shore soon I see a person with a ring so that is a
          player then Flash before he even noticed me I easily decapitated him
          cut off his finger and took his ring and put it on my finger after
          that I simply said book and a book appeared in front of me whom I
          summon my tablet and pull out a charger at the same time I put the
          tablet on charging and with the other side of the cable I touched the
          ring and I tap on the app called hacking on the screen of the tablet
          appeared different codes and different things I just narrowed my eyes
          and quickly tapped on the screen then suddenly a notification appeared
          on the screen hacking successful I couldn't help but smile at this now
          I can fill this book with any card and can take them from here Chapter
          30 I just smile I analyze the ring and see some men inscriptions on
          the inside of it I must say this is some complicated stuff I can't
          help but wonder how many talented people and how long it took to
          create Greed Island I was here just so I could get some cards that
          would have a very good utility in the Dark Continent I have visited
          countless ruins about the Dark Continent and learned that every day in
          that hell hole would be a battle for survival and since the records
          are hundreds possibly thousands of years old the information might
          even be outdated but I for sure want to prepare 100 % for the battles
          that I will have in there I don't just want to survive in the Dark
          Continent I want to thrive on there the book already had 31,100 cards
          needed to complete the game so that is pretty good for me with my
          strength I can easily get the others it also seems like my cute
          student is here I can sense her location from the needle that I put
          inside her forehead well I will meet her later anyway I started
          running towards the center of the island I saw a couple of weaklings
          down the road so I just quickly killed them and took any of the cards
          they had also hacked their rings too now I have 10 rings and way more
          space to hold any card that I want obviously I hid those by wearing
          gloves I must say it feels quite nice being all sneaky again it feels
          like such a long time since I used to hide from anyone or anything
          just so I could survive anyway in around 7 minutes I arrived in anok
          keba the town of prices and just went around the city I had enough
          money on me and since people in here also use the same monetary value
          like in the outside world but they had to be in card form I turned
          them in card form and just went around buying any sweets or delicious
          foods that were around there seemed to be a monthly rock paper scissor
          tournament going on around here I obviously joined and used my high
          perception and speed to win every single match after I finished this
          the referee came forward and gave me a sword which had strange runes C
          carved into it I turned it into a card and put in my book sword of
          truth shinjitsu not suuji number 083 rank B transformation 22 card
          Effect splits into two anything and anyone deceitful in Trials it's a
          criminal's worst nightmare the sword will shatter when used to cut
          some un truthful but will regenerate if stored in its Scabbard for one
          day that was a nice weapon really useful against someone when you are
          unsure if he is being truthful though I doubt that it can cut through
          anyone deceitful after all it doesn't have enough conditions on it to
          even come close to making it that Powerful 2 hours later and after
          that I defeated an NPC who I suspect is actually a real human we had a
          sword fight and because he was pretty weak and I had overwhelming raw
          power he was easily defeated and the card I got was Paladin's necklace
          necklace of the Holy Knights number 084 rank D transformation 60 card
          Effect a player wearing this will reflect curses cast upon him and be
          able to undo curses placed on cards he touches honestly this is a
          pretty fun game I really am enjoying it I can really relax and hear
          now where are the highlevel monster areas 1 month later General POV
          some people on Greed Island were running away from some type of giant
          lizard person the five of them were all regretting coming here in this
          dangerous Zone but then suddenly flash like an impossibility like
          something out of a fairy tale the giant lizard man was decapitated by
          some dark shadow the people turned around in shock when they saw that
          they wanted to say something but before any of them could they were
          also decapitated out of the air Jax appears with his usual business
          suit on together with his reading glasses which he doesn't even need
          anymore this got boring I already have 97,000 100 cards I only need to
          get breath of Angel and plot of Beach and then the quiz will open up
          though I will have to defeat Razer to get plot of beach thought Jax
          while calculating his next actions because of his overwhelming
          strength nothing on this island was even a challenge anymore he knew
          that not even rayizer can make him sweat he would let Razer punch him
          all day long and even then he doubted if he would even gain a small
          bruise probably not 2 weeks later in the je Island Badlands there is a
          beautiful female with black hair that goes up to her shoulders and she
          has black eyes Mikasa was teaching her student iie how to control her
          hatsu okay now float on it iie nodded put her pointing finger and
          thumb together to form a circle then ran through her fingers and
          formed a transparent screen like thing in the circle made by her
          fingers them she blew on it and swash a giant bubble was made as big
          as the 12-year-old iie she jumped on the bubble that she created and
          started slowly floating around Mikasa had a smile on her face when she
          saw this that is amazing iie you are truly talented at this in another
          decade you will probably be as strong as me when Mikasa said that was
          without even noticing anything she heard someone whisper into her ear
          but that is not that strong now is it chapter 31 as soon as Mikasa
          hears the whisper behind her she immediately turned around and
          clenched her fist and punched whoever was behind her before the punch
          connected though she used KO and with 100% of her n concentrated on
          her fist she backhanded the person behind her crunch as her punch
          connected Mikasa heard the loud crack of bones breaking and saw the
          person she just hit in her hand the person who she just hit was
          wearing something she was very familiar with and had a very familiar
          smirk on his face even as she had bashed the back of her fist into his
          face it was Jack's she looked at her hand it was completely mangled
          with her fingers all broken in awkward positions it had felt as if she
          had just hit an immovable and indestructible object Jax's nose though
          no indication of pain came out of Mikasa she was in very deep pain but
          she has had worse then silent tears slowly came out of her eyes not
          out of pain or anything like that it was out of happiness for finally
          finding Jax and seeing that he is okay though contrary to Mikasa Jax
          had a completely Carefree smile on his face yo Mikasa how have you
          been though Mikasa was still in shock when she heard Jack speak like
          that she felt an overwhelming nostalgia she fell down on her knees on
          the ground as even more tears came out of her eyes when Jack saw that
          he looked uncomfortable and fidgeted around a little awkwardly uh I
          didn't mean it when I said you were weak your men has advanced to an
          amazing level and it also seems you have kept up your training I could
          count the men users stronger than you in one hand especially when you
          use your hat Su and that punch you gave me was mediocre I I mean
          amazing too he crouched down to mikasa's level and started patting her
          head so come on now don't be so down Mikasa when Mikasa heard Jax's
          insensitive words she couldn't help but smile you are really horrible
          Sensei said Mikasa as she was half crying and laughing now while this
          was all happening iie was still standing on her bubble and didn't know
          how to get down but she didn't want to interrupt this moment her
          Sensei Mikasa and Jax were having she slowly was Rising higher and
          higher then Mikasa got up and hugged Jax he reciprocated and hugged
          her back and he took a small vial filled with red liquid from his
          pocket he poured it into mikasa's hand and it immediately started
          setting her hand back in place and healing it Mikasa was a little
          surprised at this she wondered where her teacher got this miraculous
          liquid from then finally iy couldn't take it anymore and screamed hey
          Sensei get me down from here mik came out of her daydreaming about Jax
          and looked up and saw her student about seven stories high can't you
          control your bubble iie said Mikasa now back to being her calm self
          again iie just shook her head Mikasa sighed a little and was about to
          equip her hatsu to give herself a boost in strength as she can't jump
          that high naturally since iie was already around 10 stories high in
          the air but as she was about to do that she had forgotten that Jax was
          next to her so he just smiled at iie crouched down and concentrated
          some n to his feet and Flash Jax easily jumped up and floated next to
          iie he gave the bubble a sharp fast poke with his finger pop the
          bubble popped and he caught iie in a princess carry and he fell down
          on the ground boom creating a crack all around the ground where he
          landed iie looked at Jax with starry eyes she had just been saved by
          her handsome prince then Jax just simply bam dropped iie on the ground
          carelessly and completely ignored her as he went towards masasa so
          masasa you have also gotten a little rusty you shouldn't have
          immediately trusted that it was me when I approached you you should
          have been a little more suspicious and Jax just kept criticizing
          masasa for being Reckless and not having her guard up while iie still
          had a shocked look on her face unlike his looks he really isn't a
          gentleman at all thought little iie as she pouted in Anger she got up
          and stomped on the ground she has never seen someone so disrespectful
          how did he even become the teacher of someone so gentle strong
          beautiful kind talented and smart like Mikasa Sensei thought iie as
          she kept criticizing Jax for not being the same as Mikasa had
          described him to be Mikasa POV I listened to Jack's sensei's criticism
          I took it to strive he still feels like a normal person even when she
          is standing one foot away from him he feels normal I still don't know
          how he even does this when I asked him once he just Shrugged and said
          turn your n silent I don't even know where to start with that and he
          is still criticizing me why I didn't also leave some nen to use for
          defense instead of using KO to gather 100% of my nen in my first I
          should have used Ryu and dedicated some percentage of my men for
          defense too so do you understand me Mikasa said Sensei to me in a
          slightly harsh tone when I heard him keep trying to teach me even now
          I feel like I am still a little girl being taught by him again the
          same as all those years ago back then I didn't even know how to
          express any emotions with Jack's Sensei patiently taking care of me
          and never not even once he complained about me being weird and never
          expressing emotion I know that no matter how he acts he does this
          because he cares about me a small smile appeared on my face as I
          thought of that he truly does care about me suddenly I felt a hand
          grab me by the top of my head and start painfully squeezing so you
          think this is funny don't you Mikasa he really treats me like I still
          am a little girl no no Sensei you are misunderstanding after that
          whole ordeal was over he started asking me how many cards I had which
          I answered with 35 he had 97 yeah he has only been here for a month
          and he already already almost finished the game how did he even find
          the secret places and such those places are hard to come by by the way
          we will be training for a month then we will get my 998th card which
          we will get by playing a game of dodgeball and we will meet some
          interesting kids at that time as Sensei said that he had a mysterious
          smile on his face muahaha I flinched a little as he then started
          laughing menacingly out of nowhere chapter 32 1 month later on the
          beach of Greed Island a man was dodging as a little girl around 12
          years old with short orange hair and she usually wears a blue dress
          suddenly another woman with cold black eyes and black hair appeared
          behind the man the woman had a knife in her hand and attempted to stab
          the man the man was wearing a suit and reading glasses he had his
          hands in his pockets as he easily sidestepped the stabbing attack the
          man was Jack's he had a small smile on his face as he danced in
          circles around Mikasa and iie while they tried to stab him what
          annoyed the girls even more was that Jack still had his hands in his
          pockets and seemed like he wasn't even trying which he really wasn't
          from his point of view the girls were throwing slow and telegraphed
          punches suddenly iie decided to use her hatsu and created a red bubble
          and when the bubble appeared in front of her she punched the bubble
          then the bubble quickly flew towards Jacks he just turned around and
          just looked at the bubble as it got close to his face Mikasa jumped
          back and boom the bubble exploded in front of Jax's face the explosion
          was about as strong as a rocket launcher then suddenly a wind came and
          cleared out the smoke from the explosion after the smoke cleared up
          both Mikasa and II couldn't help but frown not only wasn't Jax injured
          at all he still had his suit and scathed and even his reading glasses
          were without even a crack on them Jax just looked at them with his
          usual smile mile that was a good explosion so you overcame the natural
          slow speed of bubbles by punching them to give them more speed that is
          smart iy also the explosion has gotten stronger that is very good it
          was about as strong as a rocket launcher and it can continue to get
          stronger the more n you put into it also since you are an emitter play
          to your strengths and since you have pretty good control over your
          bubbles it could still be better so train manipulation after all since
          you are an emitter you have an A % affinity for manipulation also
          don't ignore your enhancement you have 80% in that too maybe try
          enhancing your bubbles by making them stronger and using them as a
          semi- Shield explained Jax his explanation was very good and easy to
          understand during this last month of training with Jax iie found
          herself respecting him more she thought that with the way Jax acted he
          wouldn't be a good teacher but he proved her wrong he is an amazing
          teacher if it wasn't for his attitude thought irie as she looked at
          Jax who had a small smile on his face but you are still a weakling
          that I could defeat without even having to use 1% of my power said Jax
          completely relaxed even while iie got angry he didn't see her as a
          threat at all damn he really is annoying though iie with a little hate
          towards Jax while this was all happening Mikasa still had a knife in
          her hand she just smiled at Jax he is still as blunt as he was back
          when he taught her so to Mikasa who used to live with him for so long
          this is pretty normal she sometimes even heard him look at himself in
          the mirror and call himself God yet Jax in general he is a very weird
          person but to Mikasa the way he acts is very normal one week later one
          week after that training battle that was the time Jax iie and Mikasa
          decided to go to challenge rayizer and his 14 Devils they had already
          met the lady n DC that will turn into the card that they need but they
          will have to defeat Razer they got to the place it was a big building
          when they went inside they saw that the building was empty there was
          also ashes in the form of a circle iie and Mikasa were confused at
          this but Jax had a smile on his face as planned exactly on time
          thought Jax as he mentioned for iri and Mikasa to follow him after
          some time they finally passed all of the other empty areas is and
          entered the DodgeBall gym when they entered there they were just in
          time to see Hoka grab the ball using H bungee gum and also biscuit
          just got disqualified for the ball touching her dress which qualifies
          as part of her body so she is out kilua suggests something but gone
          interrupts him saying I won't settle for some cheap win Jack Smiles a
          little at this scene and just looks towards Razer and says so after
          they finish their game can we go then Razer just turned towards us us
          he had this peaceful look on his face as he just nods of course though
          you must also have 14 players are n constructs counted as members
          asked Jax to which Razer just nodded so after that Jax and the girls
          went to sit down to wait until the game was over Jax just sees that
          the game is going almost completely like Canon even the ball catching
          thing when Hoka Gan and kilua fuse together he just Smiles at this a
          little that is when Gan kilua and Hoka look at him Gan and kilua have
          a surprised look on their faces at this and Gan as the bulkhead person
          he is he just bluntly asked oh you are that guy with the Phantom troop
          Jax just has an amused look on his face when he hears gone say that
          well me and the troop aren't really Partners neither am I in the troop
          we are just simple acquaintances gone immediately nods ah okay I
          understand kilua had a conflicted look on his face as he thought gone
          is way too trusting hisoka on the other hand had a smile on his face
          but unlike when he met the troop Hoka was more under control of his
          instincts so he didn't immediately tried to attack him this time Jax
          already saw gon J jenin and he had a small teasing smile on his face I
          am just about to end this kid's career thought Jax amusingly they
          continued the game like that and nothing really changed from Canon Gan
          used his jenin Razer deflected and hissoka caught it with his bungee
          gum and bounced it back Razer was about to return the ball back but
          with bunge gums both Rubber and gum ability the ball got stuck to
          razer's hand and pushed him out of bounds winning the game normally
          just like gone wanted then finally came Jax's turn when he got up
          Mikasa and iie were about to follow but he just signaled them to stay
          down down Gan kilua and the rest of their team members were still here
          they were curious at what Jax would do Jax just simply said to Razer I
          will heal you with an angel's breath card if you allow me and you to
          play oneon-one Jax then pointed towards gone plus the kid could learn
          a thing or two from this bout Razer just sigh and just rolls his
          shoulders as if testing them for something no need for that I have my
          own Angel's breath it would be fun fighting someone like you I can
          sense a certain dangerous feeling from you Razer then pulled out a
          card and used it an angel figure appeared and she breathed towards him
          healing all of his minor injuries that he suffered during the
          dodgeball game against Gan and his team they got on the field and
          Razer threw the ball towards Jax you can start first said Razer with
          his peaceful look on his face Jax just nodded towards Razer and then
          he looked at gone who was watching the game intently you have a quite
          simple ability little kid simple but good so let's see how far it can
          go as Jack said that he threw the ball up and took a certain pose
          immediately all of the people's eyes in the room opened wide in shock
          even biscuit was surprised a little as in shock she unconsciously said
          impossible boom Jax's Aura flew out though it had no negative intent
          in it the amount of Aura seemed to consumed the whole building as Jax
          used aren it made everyone break out in cold sweat even Razer then
          Jax's Aura all turned in a golden color and it went concentrating
          towards his fist this strange phenomenon produced a strange sound as
          his fist started shining like the sun surrounded by Flames the ball
          that he threw upwards started falling down and finally he said the
          words Jan Ken chapter 33 then Jax's Aura all turned a golden color and
          it went towards his fist this strange phenomenon produced a strange
          sound as his fist started shining like the sun the ball that he threw
          upwards started falling down and finally he said the word Jan Ken with
          every word he said his men got even stronger Jax charged the attack
          until the ball was in front of him and then he punched it as he said
          Rock Boom the ball is hit Foo and it goes towards Razer who as he saw
          the ball coming towards him he had opened his eyes and had an
          expression of uncertainty on his face razer's first instinct was that
          he must Dodge this attack but then he remembered gone he is watching
          and the kid didn't dodge razer's attacks I can't look cowardly in
          front of Jing's son decided Razer as he used KO and concentrated all
          of his men on his hands as he clasped them together He adjusted his
          position to minimize the damage he would suffered then the ball came
          close and he received it with his hands swish but the force behind the
          ball was too powerful as Razer went slipping towards the wall at break
          neck speed boom he was pushed through the wall boom and another wall
          he could feel his back bloodied and his wrists were broken but he
          wouldn't give up so Razer just clenched his teeth as he smelled the
          outside air signifying that he was pushed outside of his building ra
          C's bones and his arms had all cracked he was just holding the ball
          from hitting his chest that would just cave in his chest and
          immediately kill him his mind is full on concentration as even
          something as simple as redirecting the ball was impossible he was
          barely keeping himself from dying just from a ball which was simply
          punched by the technique Jax copied razer's face started forming into
          a nervous look some could say a scared look appeared on his face as he
          couldn't hold the ball anymore and he was actually flying towards the
          wall water splash he fell into the water creating a huge splash the
          ball started forcing him to the depth of the shore water since it
          wasn't too deep it was only about two stories deep and underwater the
          ball finally seemed to have finally lost its power as razer's back
          touched the ground underwater then he used his legs which only had
          minor injuries to try and swim upwards and into the shores he was glad
          I almost died there thought Razer with a deep deep fear of Jack
          starting to take root in his heart that guy is a monster back in the
          Dodge Ballroom everyone looked at Jax in fear awe and shock they
          didn't even know what to say they all felt the power of that punch
          Razer would be lucky if he survived something like that they looked at
          the walls where Razer was ranm through they had giant humanized holes
          on them the first one to have the courage to speak to Jax wasn't
          Ahsoka who had a crazy smile on his face it was gone as he said wait
          so you copied my hatsu Jax just smiled at that and the one to actually
          answer was biscuit no that isn't possible the ability to perfectly
          copy or steal someone else's hatsu would have around five conditions
          to fulfill plus those conditions would have to be pretty restrictive
          for a power like that to exist he couldn't have completed all of them
          in such a short period of time analyzed biscuit with a critical eye
          using her Decades of experience to guess how Jax was able to do that
          then after a couple of seconds she continued saying it is natural
          Talent isn't it you copied that ability just by looking at it and
          since it is an enhancement hatsu it is simple so you could understand
          it easier it wasn't even that you copied the ability or something like
          that it was more like you recreating an ability from scratch which
          took gone here months to develop you simply developed it in seconds
          what you have isn't a monstrous hatsu you just have monstrous Talent
          when he heard this Jax just smiled and turned towards biscuit giving
          her an okay sign Bingo you read it perfectly said Jax but what he
          didn't elaborate on was his original ability that was way more
          monstrous than his talent after all he was able to get his talent from
          raising his talent stat which now is at level 12 two levels above Gan
          and killua's estimated Talent level suddenly Gan just pointed towards
          Jax and childishly said I don't care how you did it you are just a
          thief and a cycat when he heard this Jax just laughed out loudly
          haahahaha as expected of Jing's son but your father also has the same
          ability too gone when he heard this gan's anger subsided and
          immediately he went to being happy wait so you know where Jing is did
          he even hear what I said though Jax even though he still had a smile
          on his face he was still a little surprised at how simple-minded the
          little psychoan is it is truly hard to believe that someone like him
          had the guts to remove his n limiter just like that contemplated Jax
          but maybe that simplemindedness of his gave him the courage to do it
          who knows really while gone was waiting for an answer from Jax he
          looked at Jax intently even Hoka was a little surprised at this after
          all he never thought that there would be people that have CW's ability
          but just instinctively and with no need to fulfill any real condition
          to get it well I don't know his General location but if you want I can
          tell you when you will meet him said Jax with a strange smile on his
          face Gan just frowned at this and the others were shocked he has an
          ability that can predict the future that was the thought on everyone's
          mind even Mikasa his student had no idea about this chapter 34 Gan
          just shook his head sideways when he heard this I don't need to know
          that I just simply need to find Jing after all knowing something like
          knowing when I will find Jing wouldn't help at all and would make my
          journey with my friend boring I would hate that Jax just smiled at
          this and Shrugged his shoulders well that is your choice kid said Jax
          as he had a strange smile on his face he went to readjust his glasses
          and they reflected the light obscuring the look that he had in his
          eyes when Jack said that he would say when gone would meet his father
          well that would be because he actually can't see the future but he
          knows about the anime but more people assuming he can read the future
          would be good because if someone was after him they would know that he
          would know about about it and for someone smart overthinking things is
          their weakens then as he was about to walk out Jax just turned around
          one last time and said well don't worry about it though you will owe
          me one kid when you finish this game you won't be able to take all of
          the cards outside so I want you to give them to me after the game is
          over they wouldn't be useful to you anyway so I will take this as
          payment for me showing how far your jenin ability can go Gan just
          simply nodded okay immediately kilua went and punched Gan hey don't
          accept a deal so easily from such a shady guy Jax just smiled at this
          and went outside Mikasa and iie were right behind him as they went
          outside Jax just looked at Mikasa from the corner of his eyes and said
          soon I will go to the Dark Continent Mikasa nodded I will come with
          you Jax had a calm look on his face as he turned around and frowned at
          Mikasa I can't guarantee your survival in any way Mikasa simply just
          nodded again I wouldn't mind Dying by your side iie just looked down
          unsure of what was even happening Jax's frown became even more
          renowned you could die a very painful death and anyways you wouldn't
          be very useful to me with your current strength Mikasa stopped walking
          Jack's face relaxed as he looked at mikasa's conflicted face he just
          decided to put the final nail as he said also you should stay with
          your student and spend a happy life on this side of the world suddenly
          as if coming to a realization Mikasa looked at Jack's a soft smile
          appeared on her face you know nothing do you Jax seg m and for the
          first time in her life she called Jax just by his name Jax seemed a
          little confused at this what is that supposed to me Mikasa she started
          laughing in happiness jaxu told me that men can become stronger the
          more emotional you are and the more restrictions you put in it right
          they were outside of the building now and quite far away from it so
          Gan and his team couldn't see or hear what they were doing suddenly
          Mikasa conjures a red dagger on her hand then immediately with a smile
          on her face she just FSH stabs her own heart no Sensei what have you
          done iie immediately panicked and screamed Jax's eyes widened in
          realization as Mikasa started falling down as she said what would
          happen if n after death was the activation condition flash he caught
          her before she could touch the ground suddenly even with her heart
          being stabbed by her own knife Jack still can hear Mikasa silently
          whisper my then my monstrous nen when I die take over this body
          Puppeteer it take over completely and follow the orders of the one
          most precious to me follow him to the end of the world and make sure
          he survives become stronger mine and give me all the power I could
          ever have so my precious person can survive and so mikasa's eyes
          closed signifying her death by mikasa's willing sacrifice and the
          extreme condition of death by Suicide as the abil's activation trigger
          dark n started surrounding Mikasa while Jax was still holding her in
          his arms a conflicted expression on his face he never quite thought
          that Mikasa would go this far then the dark n surrounded Mikasa slowly
          changing her body from the inside even a knife inside her chest melted
          inside her being her wound to her heart started mending itself
          together and after all of that was dunh her and quieted down and her
          hair slowly turned silver Jack still just looked at her he had already
          calmed down and he didn't even sense mikasa's heartbeat anymore then
          strangely Mikasa opened her eyes she still had those dark eyes she
          looked around strangely her eyes were dull and strange as if they had
          no life in them Jax just looked at her and said that was beyond stupid
          Mikasa Mikasa didn't have any reaction even though her eyes were
          opened her face looked cold her body had also gotten colder like she
          already was dead she she got up from Jax's arms and stood up iie was
          happy that her teacher hadn't died but when she saw the dull look on
          her teacher's eyes she saw that masasa was dead it was just her
          postmortem removing it on the other side Jax had a completely
          different opinion his face was full of curiosity like he had just
          found a new toy to play with he looked at mikasa's eyes and she too
          looked at his eyes Mikasa doing that was the peak of stupidity her raw
          strength right now would be around no she is a little stronger than a
          chimera ant Royal Guard so she can defeat most of the people on this
          side of the continent I wonder if she knows she is in it now it is
          simply a tool though I wonder can it still use her hatsu if yes then
          she is way stronger than a royal guard after all her little costume
          hatsu gives her even more physical power I guess we will have to just
          wait to find out who would have guessed that a girl I picked up just
          so I could train her and become a three star hunter thought Jax well I
          guess the Chimera and will be next chapter 35 but really though Mikasa
          wasn't as sane as she seemed to begin with remember the time when she
          was willing to kill Hoka she accepted that iie has a high chance of
          dying and also it was insinuated that she tortured people to find
          information on Jax's whereabouts truly the only reason she even had a
          student was just so she could in a creepy way recreate what she and
          Jax had also remember the time when she and Jax reunited iie was was
          going to the sky with the bubble and masasa was so concentrated on Jax
          that in her eyes iie is unimportant and she completely forgot about
          her mikasa's whole goal in life was to chase after Jax and try to find
          him again her life is centered around Jax and her doing the ultimate
          sacrifice as her emotional state was all messed up lead to her own
          suicide also some of you seem confused by Jax's reaction read the
          title of the story now do you know what selfish means let me just
          Google it for you and copypaste it here selfish of a person action or
          motive lacking consideration for others concern chiefly with one's own
          personal profit or pleasure you see now yeah and him caring about
          Mikasa is not selfish bro come on now any other reaction out of him
          and it would have broken character also if you want to drop the story
          drop it I don't care I don't need 100 messages informing me about it I
          am not your daddy I don't need to know everything you do I read every
          single comment and don't want to waste time reading something like a
          drop comment okay now back to the story we go announcement end I just
          wait a little here in Greed Island just a little more until gone and
          the others get all of the cards I am currently in one of the hotels
          there are two separate beds I am lying on one bed with masasa on the
          bed next to me her eyes dull and emotionless like a dolls after the
          game is finished I am planning on getting all of the cards after after
          all having these abilities in the outside world is quite amazing I
          mean my n is pretty good and I would like to consider myself pretty
          strong but I for sure do know that I can't instantly build a city of
          10 0 that listens to whatever I say now that is what one of the good
          cards in this game can do I am obviously not after the raw power of
          the cards since it isn't generally good what I am after is their
          versatility mikasa's student has left the game after masa's death so
          now she is going on a journey she believes that Mikasa made her choice
          and so will she she is going to become a disaster Hunter well good for
          her then probably won't see her anymore after all next is the Chimera
          ant and after that it will be the Dark Continent I look at Mikasa next
          to me her hair white I have been studying how it Mikasa Works her body
          is completely cold like a corpse even her heart has already stopped
          beating but somehow her nen is still flowing around her body and it
          has stopped her from rotting she also seems to somehow have
          intelligence even though her brain is already dead she isn't like a
          machine more like an artificial intelligence but quite impressive if I
          must say so I have been teaching how to not be tricked in a battle by
          an opponent also she somehow seems to have developed a natural hatsu
          her and amount temporarily Rises with the appropriate danger that I am
          in the more danger and closer to dying I am the more powerful she gets
          Mikasa is a conjurer so this ability isn't in her category at all
          conjurers have a 1% chance to become a specialist so I believe that
          she has developed a specialist ability must say that ability is quite
          nice I finally have someone who is useful and I bet that her hatsu has
          more hidden secrets now I can't wait to discover them it's like a
          mystery game and I love games 20 days later while I was just relaxing
          and trying to gather even more cards that seemed useful pow I just
          kicked a giant lizard turning it into a card but that is when I Heard
          a Voice say participant 001 has collected 99 cards the cards to get
          the last card there will be a quiz left H so did G and kilowa finish
          the game and get all of the cards that is the most likely scenario
          boom suddenly behind me a large explosion happened I just turn around
          and see masasa using two knives to cut through some monsters like a
          hot knife through butter thankfully the monsters turn into cards or
          else we would have been covered in blood and guts a long time ago I
          just look at her and say Mikasa that is enough she immediately stops
          after killing her next victim fash and in the blink of an eye she
          appears next to me well that was quite slow but to others that would
          seem pretty fast she is up there with around the speed of sound not
          quite passing it but she was around there if she had stats she would
          have nine in agility and endurance then an eight in strength her body
          still hasn't shown any signs of deterioration which is good as
          expected men isn't something that can be explained by something like
          science anyway I go towards the little place where we enter the game
          from I see that there are a lot of players around I also told Mikasa
          to wait for me outside of this place where no one can see her as I
          walk forward I can still hear the quiz being asked I don't really pay
          attention to it because I don't care I already know who will win and
          if gone doesn't win I will simply kill the other winner and get his
          cards after all no one on this island can challenge me I just sit down
          quite a distance away from Gone in kilua some people look at me but I
          just let a little of my N Flow out of me but kept invisible under I in
          so they can't see it but they will feel a certain danger Instinct not
          to approach me it's simply a self-defense mechanism like when a normal
          human looks at a lion it instinctively feels fear when Gan finally
          finishes Greed Island some people go to bother him but I see that they
          are weaklings so I didn't need to help him as he finished them off by
          himself I just let him go meet the people and so on General POV as Gan
          comes out of the meeting with Jing's friends he can't help but think
          about what they said to him as he walked forward he saw that there
          were biscuit and kilua waiting for him in a tower is this the real
          world now asked Gan kilua just looked at him nonchalantly yep it
          really doesn't feel that different says gone as he looks at his hand
          kilua just shrugs well Greed Island is the real world too so so what
          cards did you get gone did you take the ones we planned about asks
          biscuit excitedly gone just nods and pulls out the three cards showing
          them to biscuit and kilua the cards were blue planet Paladin's
          necklace and plot of beach biscuit takes her card and materializes it
          while looking at the beautiful gem called Blue Planet she has stars in
          her eyes gone materializes plot of Beach and Paladin's necklace
          turning plot of Beach into its real form and accompany card suddenly
          they hear someone out of nowhere just calmly say now that was clever
          are you going to find Jin with that accompany card immediately they
          look at where the sound came killua's eyes widened in fear when he saw
          Jack standing on the ceiling upside down as if walking on it he even
          seemed to defy gravity as not even his hair or clothes was following
          gravity they all stayed normal as if he was walking on the ground but
          he still remembered how scary he was against razor biscuit also was
          surprised by this kilua and her have been here for almost an hour they
          haven't noticed anything in here it was as if he had come out of
          nowhere that is impossible even if he was sneaky or fast the wind
          around him would have moved and I would have been able to sense it how
          did he do it is it some type of hatsu though she was thinking all of
          this biscuit had a smile on her face after all with her experience
          even if she is surprised her body won't even give a hint of it on the
          contrary gone had a starry look on his eyes wo how are you doing that
          Jax just shrugs his shoulders and casually said I am a strong guy gone
          I can do a lot of cool sht chapter 36 General POV Jax just looks at
          the people in front of him while he is standing upside down as if
          Defying Gravity even his hair and clothes seem normal kilua and
          biscuit are very suspicious of jacks but gone has stars in his eyes as
          he looks at him so anyway can I get the cards since you don't need
          them anymore asks Jax as he has a small smirk on his face Gan Just
          Smiles and says sure you can have it and he throws his ring towards
          Jax which he catches and smiles towards gone thanks if you need
          something in the future just ask me who knows if I feel like it I
          might help you says Jax already knowing that they will meet again he
          then suddenly drops down as gravity starts taking effect Jax just does
          a backflip and lands on his feet with his hands still in his pockets
          he just turns around and starts walking away but suddenly biscuit is
          still suspicious so she just uses her innocent look as she asks Mister
          excuse me but what do you need that thing for do you plan to go back
          to the game since the game is already finished you won't get any
          rewards anymore when he hears this Jack stops and turns back around he
          smiles at them and he takes out the ring that gone gave him after that
          he just says book poof the book appears on his hand immediately
          biscuits kowas and even gan's eyes widened in Surprise T that isn't
          supposed to be possible says biscuit unconsciously but she uses her
          long experience to come to a conclusion you overwrote the N ability
          you have a hatsu especially dedicated to this you must have a
          condition on this ability that only allows this for Greed Island Jax
          just laughs at what biscuit says haahaha you truly are smart that is
          all he says as he just turned around and walked away not saying
          anything anymore his ability isn't like that at all contrary to
          Biscuit's expectations he doesn't have a lot of conditions on his
          ability due to his massive nen not many people even have as many hatsu
          as Jacks because they will just be mediocre and not master any of them
          plus their ability needs to be somehow connected for maximum
          efficiency Jax's ability the game which turns his body and soul into a
          game character by using manipulation men which Jax has 100% efficiency
          in it due to being his natural category his ability manipulates
          everything about Jax from his muscles Soul talent and even then this
          also makes him resistant to control abilities like a lum's needle or
          something like that due to manipulators being first come first serve
          he is technically already controlled by his own inability as Jax
          walked away from them he walks along the city he just walks towards
          one of the dark alleys as he walked in there out of the Shadows came
          mikaza she had her usual emotionless look in her eyes tell me Mikasa
          what did you learn today asks Jax this is a method he devised to try
          and understand how Mikasa works now after all having a tool without
          knowing how it works is pretty useless I learned many things but the
          most important were the basic and advanced n techniques you taught me
          I learned them all within a day but it seemed as if it was instinctual
          and I already knew those I suspect that it is due to masasa and
          knowing them already says Mikasa in her usual monotone voice Jack just
          cusps his chin as if he is thinking after a couple of seconds he says
          H that is true I made Mikasa learn those techniques to use them
          instinctively before she died also technically you aren't learning
          those techniques more like remembering how to use them again but how
          does she even store memories with her brain dead maybe if I learned
          how her body works I could copy it and use it myself after all even
          though I have high talent and can technically learn Tech techniques
          just by looking at them when it comes to nen I also have to know the
          working and conditions behind a hatsu to be able to copy it
          contemplates Jax after all if he can understand how Mikasa keeps her
          body from rotting it could be applied to his own body and make him
          essentially Immortal now did you study the math biology and political
          books that I gave you to read asks Jax again as he mentions for Mikasa
          to follow him as they walk out of the alley after an hour they
          casually just walk outside of the city Mikasa is walking normally
          while Jax has a type of game console on his hand he just whistled
          along as he played the game he used his great speed and perception to
          beat a lot of the RPG bosses while being low-leveled after all to him
          the game is super slow and he can make the best possible move every
          time and Dodge at the perfect time Jax has an excited expression on
          his face as he pumps his fist upwards yes finally level 78 imma about
          to go and spawn kill some noes when Mikasa saw this she asked why are
          we doing this what are our next actions Jax Jax stops playing and
          turns towards Mikasa with an excited look on his face he puts his game
          inside of the pocket in his jacket tell me why did you ask such a
          question Mikasa asks Jack excitedly as he approaches Mikasa contrary
          to Jax's excitement m Kasa emotionlessly answers I have understood
          that I need to know about our situation in order to protect you better
          H that is reasonable but you must remember that the best way to
          protect and be useful to me is to follow my orders says Jax as he
          yawns losing interest in Mikasa again I understand Jax then says
          anyway we are going to a place that will be beneficial to me but sadly
          I will have to leave you outside of the place where I will Vis it as
          he says that boom Jack as monstrous nin flows out of him the ground
          under him cracks slowly out of his nen needles of different sizes from
          as small as a normal needle and needles as big as a truck are created
          Gamers piercing jaw just waves his hand and Flash immediately the
          needles start moving and forming a serpent like creation when it fully
          forms it takes the form of a giant Chinese dragon hovering above the
          ground the dragon is as big as a train metallic dragon even Mikasa is
          stunned but not by the dragon but the nen that Jax just released for a
          moment to create the dragon Jax just jumps at top the dragon's head
          and lies down he looks at Mikasa and loudly says Mikasa jump in this
          is a faster way of traveling we will reach our destination within days
          Mikasa jumps on the drag made out of metal which is made from Jax's
          nen well now let's go says Jax with a smile on his face Foo the dragon
          immediately Soares towards the sky at incredible speeds even faster
          than a plane he could have made a simple needle to travel so there was
          no need to truly make a dragon out of them all traveling also needs
          some style thinks Jax with an amused smirk on his face chapter 37 2
          days later it took only 2 days for Jax to arrive at the outskirts of
          NGL he dropped masasa in one of the towns in the outskirts outside of
          the NGL Jack POV now I can finally meet some Monsters of my caliber
          maram I am coming for you but still I decided to do this journey by
          foot instead of relying on my big flying dragon after all currently I
          am in no rush I just casually towards the the Border since I am in no
          rush I looked at the creatures around after all I have never really
          been to NGL it wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be also I
          passed all over the border patrol I didn't want to bother with a
          checkup from them after all since the government in NGL will collapse
          soon there is no need to follow the rules on here they won't make
          problems for me I used I to spread my nen in a circular motion to
          check every movement around 3 km no Chimera ant around maybe in a
          little more time they will start to truly develop they will be a great
          source of exp for me at least until the king is born that guy will be
          the biggest prey that I have ever hunted suddenly I sense a snake that
          tries to jump me but I just give it a look and burst it bursts like a
          watermelon aren't animals supposed to have a survival Instinct or
          something I just look at the snake again and narrow my eyes using G yo
          it doesn't have n so being some type of spying animal or something
          like that is very unlikely but then again snake Charmers exist in this
          world they don't even need to use nin to charm snakes also there seems
          to be no camera on the snake so even technological spying seems
          unlikely it must be just another normal snake I guess I should wait a
          little more then I crouch down and dig my hand underground and I start
          digging even more until there is a hole about my size I just jump down
          and cover it up this is the best possible way to survive surprise
          attacks you can feel the vibrations in case of an attack from an
          underground enemy and even above ground when someone is close the
          vibrations wake me up too having senses to this level is truly amazing
          also I better be careful now after all no matter how much raw power I
          have all that is needed is just a complex ability to lock me up till
          starvation or to somehow kill me n battles aren't all about raw power
          but more about finesse and creativity my hatsu allows me to absolutely
          control everything about myself it's not overly complex on the outside
          but I also needed to have medical knowledge and much more in order for
          my men to understand what I wanted from it 6 hours later after 6 hours
          of sleep I immediately wake up and flexibly I dig above ground Ian
          nothing yet though there seems to oh there is actually a chimera ant 2
          km from here and it is flying it seems to be carrying a human so it
          has started then that is good now I need to find their nest and wait
          for them to learn then and develop some more then I can start to
          Massacre them well I better follow this ant I better have a place
          close to the nest so they don't start moving away without me knowing
          as I follow the flying ant I arrive at a shtt y looking place it looks
          like an ant nest just with the ants needing bigger accommodations due
          to them being bigger so the nest is also big damn it seems like once
          an ant always an ant but really though it is stupid of me expecting
          any more from them what they really have is luck if the queen landed
          anywhere else except NGL she would have been killed and even her
          soldiers would have been easily obliterated but it was lucky of them
          to land on NGL but also at the same time I pity the ants not really
          they will never be able to catch up to humanity no matter what even
          the king who they see as their Messiah is useless just one rose
          nuclear bomb is enough to kill him and really any country worth its
          name has a bomb like that they are really cheap to produce too I mean
          even in the worst case scenario I don't see Humanity losing at all
          sure we would have to sacrifice maybe millions of people but humans
          make choices like that easily ants think that their idea of structure
          and order the way that ants will always follow the king and a king
          always being worthy of his title will win against Humanity's
          individualism they think that humanity is is as strong as their
          weakest link in the chain how stupid of them they don't understand
          Humanity's evil they underestimate Humanity we are a race of
          psychopaths the ants can never match our malice I better secure this
          land and make it better for me to fight in one month later just like
          this one month passed I must say I now want kilu as n ability maybe
          then I can charge the games I have been playing I have been running
          out of batteries to use lately might actually have to go back and get
          some I mean suddenly before I can even think about the next thing I
          sense a malicious n appear on the nest due to me currently being
          underground and the only light source was the game that I had in my
          hand for a split second I stopped and my character in the game died
          sht I lost that game I have to start from the beginning now but I
          decide to put the game back in my pocket Sai I have had enough fun for
          today also it seems like pitu was just born Yan so tonight is the time
          kite dies I guess I better watch some of that it is bound to be
          entertaining maybe I can even copy kite's ability after all having
          another rebirth chance doesn't sound so bad flash a couple of hours
          later I just follow Gan kilua and kite walking around and talking they
          seem to be going towards the Chimera ant nest I stay at a constant 46
          M away just enough to be out of kiten not that he could sense me even
          if otherwise but I don't really need to get any close I have a pretty
          good eyesight I can see that pitu has sensed kite her Ian really is
          something able to sense almost 2 km away pitu jumps from the nest and
          there goes kite's arm is flying gone is knocked out by Kila and they
          start running away as expected I mean that is the best possible
          decision for them after all they would have only gotten in the way now
          let's see if my estimate for stats is correct a level 9 stat is around
          Royal Guard level so this should be correct till now I have determined
          that pitu has a level 9 in agility especially due to her fast jump
          that can actually break through speed of sound for a split second
          chapter 38 General POV kite seeing that Gan and kilua start to run
          away he sigh in relief he can help and by them sometime to escape Jax
          also sees this but he decides to ignore gone and kill in favor of
          seeing the fight between kite and pitu kite summons his crazy slots
          hatsu which takes the form of a small clown-like creature floating
          next to him as soon as the creature is summoned it just says in a
          joking tone haahahaha it seems like you are in quite a pinch now
          sucker looks like a good number is coming up pitu just looks at this
          and says with an interested voice oo so even something like that is
          possible but kilua while running away had a whole different thought
          process while he is carrying Gan on his back he can't help but
          criticize his and gon's actions we were conceited kite is stronger
          than both of us combined even when he lost an arm that is his
          conclusion that is reality if kite had been alone things probably
          wouldn't have ended up like this we were total idiots the
          uncompromising reality has set down on kilua back at Jacks he is just
          looking at kite's crazy slots and after a second of analyzing he
          finally came to a conclusion The Chosen ability isn't radong kite
          actually cheated his own condition that is smart the miniature clown
          is an intelligent being and when it sees the situation it judges the
          best ability that kite will need kite of course will never admit it or
          his nen might actually weaken his ability or even backlash and lose
          the hatsu completely if I knew what exact conditions he put in his
          hatsu I could create a copy of the ability H that is quite a creative
          way to go with your ability the danger of actually being careful to
          not speak about the condition cheating might Empower his nen
          absolutely amazing no wonder Jing is called one of the top five nin
          users as his student kite learned quite a lot from him kite just looks
          at the enemy in front of him this is monstrous he has never felt such
          n before crazy slots has chosen the ability and he knows that he is
          most likely to die in this fight but before that happens the least
          that he can do is hope that his death is enough to activate this
          rebirth ability her inexperience was shown when she simply jumped her
          way here she simply follows her instincts on how to attack it left her
          open but I made the mistake of being worried for kilua and Gan to take
          that chance to attack it was the best chance it is unlikely she will
          be airborne for an attack anymore well it wouldn't matter anyway I
          doubt I would have been able to run from this type of monster even if
          I had two arms thinks kite as he takes a breath and his n flows out of
          his body when nurpus sees this her eyes form into slits she smiles at
          this her Aura gushes out too but unlike kite she has an unclear Aura
          flow it was chaotic and had almost no finesse to it boom the ground
          under pitu cracks as she attacks kite though the difference in speed
          between the two is huge and pitu almost created a sonic boom kite is
          still able to do by jumping to the side he already predicted that this
          is how the inexperienced pitu will attack due to pitu using too much
          power in the charge she was about to crash into a tree but she
          Maneuvers her body to kick off the tree but crash the tree is
          immediately snapped as soon as foot touches the tree kite takes this
          moment of confusion and mistake on Pit's part to make an attack with
          all of his power he uses KO and concentrates 100% of his Aura in the
          tip of his rebirth key FSH pitu is able to dodge that attack by
          instinctively doing a backflip but kite predicted this and as she is
          midair his attack changes Direction bomb hitting pitu in the cheek
          crash and she crashes into another tree breaking it she now has a
          small scratch wound on her cheek suddenly a large gash of blood
          appeared in kite's chest his eyes widened a little from the pain while
          he attacked Patu she in that Split Second while she was being flung
          away used her tail to attack kite at the same time on the other hand
          Jax who sees this gets up to leave he knows how the rest of the battle
          will go kite is already tired and suffering from blood loss his n
          ability which is activated by his death and that a chance of getting
          the rebirth key thing it seems like kite will have to be reborn in
          another 5 minutes probably even less the fight will be over maybe
          longer if pitu decides to play with her prey thinks Jax as he walks
          away neither kite nor pitu were able to sense his movement after all
          if Jax doesn't want to be found then he won't be found it is as simple
          as that his men is completely silent as if he never existed to begin
          with at dawn kilowa and an unconscious gone were under a giant tree
          kiloa was tired so was sitting and breathing heavily due to the long
          journey and exhaustion that he had due to having to carry God with him
          too Gan was lying on the ground next to him suddenly kilua hears the
          sound of a car engine coming from the opposite direction where he came
          from before he looks towards the vehicle and sees that it is a
          military truck three figures come out of it one is a tall man with
          white hair and wearing sunglasses he also has a big smoking pipe on
          his hand he has it swung over his shoulder he is Morel next is a man
          wearing a neat suit and reading glasses he has neatly combed hair and
          his hands are in his pockets he is nav the last person is someone
          kilua is very familiar with he has a white ponytail and a white beard
          with the tip of his beard being a gray black he is walking on his
          strange with sandals and wearing a white yucata he is Neto the hunter
          Association chairman when Morel sees kilua he just smiles and says
          what do you know it's just a little kid this is what happens when you
          play with fire hurry on home now kid nav just adjusts his glasses when
          he hears this he says to Morel come on now Morel don't be so harsh on
          him he is just a child after all kilia doesn't say anything at this
          and just keeps his head down he isn't someone who would be riled up by
          something like this he is someone raised by the best assassins after
          all when Neo sees kilo's demeanor he has an IM used smile on his face
          as he laughs softly ho ho ho you look like you had it quite rough hm
          then Neo's expression changes to a little amused even as kilua looks
          up a little he sees the absolute terrified look kilua has on his face
          were they really that intimidating asked Neo while his mind was
          thinking in a future fight that he might enjoy kiloa looks Neo in the
          eyes as he says one of them knew how to use n he then recalls the aura
          that pitu released it was the creepiest aura that I have ever come
          across States kilua as he tries to compare pus Aura with the people
          that he has encountered in his journey more terrifying than my brother
          more than Hoka contemplates kilua kilua looks at Neo nav and Morel in
          front of him sensing their Aura because I have learned men myself I
          can tell you guys are extremely strong however I don't think you will
          be able to win against that monster how about me then suddenly a voice
          comes from the close by distance a man is walking towards them with
          slow and steady steps he has black hair which was sweeped backwards
          with only one long strand in front of his face and brown eyes which
          have a certain terrifying light on them but none of that was important
          as what everyone is concentrating in is the terrifying Aura coming out
          of him chapter 39 Jax who has now gotten rid of his glasses and is
          just calmly walking with his hands in his pockets he is wearing his
          suit like usual and no dirt or Grime seems to be on his suit he seems
          just like your everyday sharp businessman but what amazed kilua Morel
          nav and even Neo is Jax's Aura the aura is massive and the others
          except Neo faces being filled with nervousness even though there is no
          negative intent towards them but what shocked them even more is the
          smooth flow of his Aura which has a gold color from the toenail to the
          tips of his hair Jax's Aura is simply perfect Jack just looks at kilua
          and says with a calm voice judging someone's fight just in their n
          amount is very unprofessional and that means that you have already
          lost when you go into a n battle you are going into the unknown you
          have no idea of your enemy capabilities or their special ability Jack
          suddenly Smiles at this though you should be cautious in an infight
          you must always go in it with 100% confidence in your Victory anyway
          as I asked before by your estimate do you think I have a chance
          against her kilua just looked at Jax still amazed by his Aura finally
          when he hears Jax say he comes off his stuper and answers with a
          simple yes Jax just smirks at this then he looks at Neo well then
          chairman Neo are you up for a little game when Noto hears his
          suggestion he just Strokes his beard and has a bemused look on his
          face H but I am an old man so don't expect me to be too good at games
          I will most likely just complain all day long haahah Jack's just
          laughs at this come on now don't underestimate yourself old man I bet
          you could take on monsters that would terrify other people I mean you
          used to be the strongest n user ho ho ho you overestimate my strength
          Jacks Ken I am nothing but an old man now it has been more than 5
          decades since I have been the strongest nowadays I don't even have
          half of my strength says Neo jovially while acting like an old man
          others could not see it but what Neo and Jax were doing is paying
          respects to each other through this Neo has determined that the
          training and pain Jax must have gone through to achieve this strength
          is unimaginable he knows that Jax has been going after strong beasts
          to fight but he never guessed it would have ended up like this though
          he didn't know that Jack simply cheated and didn't spend one decade
          training non-stop JAX on the other hand knew Neo's ambition through
          the anime he respects the old man for his efforts into trying to
          become the strongest and his Devotion to martial arts to others it
          seemed like two men being overly humble and joking around but to Neo
          and Jax it is a way of respect from the former strongest human to the
          current it is undeniable he is currently the strongest human and
          probably the best n user his control over his Aura is meticulous which
          says something due to his huge Aura I doubt that even the 12 zodiacs
          and all their abilities put together would be able to beat Jax over
          here H he might actually take away the fight where I am supposed to
          die I am getting weaker and weaker every day my power is waning I want
          to find an enemy where I can give it my all against I could fight
          young Jacks here but sad L the poor man's Rose bomb is already inside
          of me so if my heart stopped yeah I don't really want to kill him
          thinks Neo analyzing if he should really fight Jax or not after all
          Jax will definitely be an opponent where he can give it his everything
          though sadly he has the bomb inside of him already so a fight to the
          death will be devastating killing them both Neo just turns towards
          kilua and his jovial tune when he talks with Jax is all gone instead
          the old man has a hard and indifferent look on his face it is very
          difficult to believe that giant Chimera ants are devouring humans but
          now that we have verified it to be true we must do all that we can to
          stop the damage from spreading Neo looks at kilowa in his eyes and
          continues saying any weak link amongst the team will be absorbed by
          the enemy understand kilua just answers with a simple yeah his mind
          was analyzing what the old man just said amongst these three a small
          group of Elites and kilua looks at jaxs that monster this also means
          that we are not included thinks kilua as he comes to his conclusion
          but suddenly Neo decided to give the kids a little hope and drive as
          he threw two half tokens to kilowa in the town nearby we have
          Unleashed Two Hitmen whether you fight them or not it's your choice
          however Neo turns around as he starts starts walking away defeat them
          and come find us show us if you have the courage to live as a hunter
          the old man stops once more and hives kilua a look we do not need any
          weaklings Only the Strong need apply Neo Morel nav and Jax start
          walking towards the NGL though nav and Morel were very nervous in the
          beginning when they felt Jax as nen now they are more relaxed due to
          long exposure to it and also Jax's Aura never displaying ious intent
          also now the nen is back inside jack so they can't feel it anymore
          Jack seems like your normal everyday person they were obviously
          shocked and a little terrified of jacks but they strangely felt no
          danger at all from him quite some Aura you have there Jack asks Morel
          now back to being himself after the shock factor of Jax's Aura amount
          is gone Jax just smirks at this yep though it really took a lot of
          training to get here I was always in search of the next big monster to
          fight when I caught wind of giant Chimera ants I come and see for
          myself Jax's smirk gets even wider as he continues saying who knows
          what new monsters I will meet next immediately nav and Morel by
          hearing what Jax just said they assume that he is a battle freak
          wanting to grow Stronger by fighting creatures stronger than himself N
          is a representation of one's inner self in a way so it isn't
          surprising that someone like Jax who they assume to be a battle freak
          and a power freak got so strong that is when Neo decides to ask Jax by
          the way what is the game that you want to play chapter 40 by the way
          what is the game that you want to play asks Neo Jack smiled at this
          and his eyes got a certain sense of amusement on them well I want to
          see who can kill the most Chimera ants without getting caught since
          you are old you can have Morel and nav backing you up since you know
          you are an old man and all that immediately Neo screams hysterically
          who are you calling an old man brat I bet I can beat you score nav and
          Morel are confused when they hear Neo be so sensitive about his age
          because when he is with them he always Embraces his age and even makes
          fun of it himself has he finally gone scile thought nav and Morel with
          awkward faces Jax just Shrugged at nro well it is the truth plus we
          will observe the enemy camp and after that our game will start just
          like this they pass one full day of traveling and finally they reach
          their destination the Chimera and Nest though they are still over 3 km
          away from it Neo uses his pointing and thumb finger to maale a circle
          he used n and put his hand up to his eye that is how he sees pitu when
          Neo notices that he says that creature it seems to be stronger than me
          referring to pitu Jax is able to see pitu with his natural sight
          Jack's POV she is strong stronger than her friend poof who is in the
          shadows of the nest Neo isn't wrong as he currently is his chances of
          winning are pretty low but after meditating he should be able to
          handle pitu within minutes after all contrary to the popular belief
          the stronger someone is the shorter their battle in hxh Cannon maram
          versus Neo fight lasted only around a minute but in that minute
          thousands of confrontations had happened I just smile at this well
          then see you old man I immediately walk away leaving nav Morel and Neo
          up to their devices and plans as I went around for a look General PV
          19 days later two giant bug like Chimera ants were looking for humans
          went suddenly FSH their heads disappeared from their bodies who later
          turn into specks of light Jax then spread his Ian and tried to find
          any other Chimera ant around H this makes 146 kills thinks Jack as
          flash he immediately appeared above two other Chimera ants close by
          and he just sank his fingers behind the creatures necks and then he
          ripped off their heads their bodies disappear in like part particles
          too of course Jax needs to touch his table than the body of the one
          whom he killed to get the EXP but he has been doing this for so long
          and with his stats it seems like it is instantaneous like as soon as
          he kills them his victims turn into exp the king will be born soon he
          he he he I really can't wait to fight him these little things that
          have already started getting boring thinks Jax excitedly after some
          time and as Jax continues hunting for some days on Neo's side
          something else completely happened while Morel and nav were resting in
          a cave they noticed a chimera ant flying towards them immediately they
          are about to escape after all when there is one Chimera ant there are
          supposed to be at least a dozen more but then they see the White Flag
          signaling surrender on the flying Chimera ant's hands they decide to
          hear what the Chimera ant whose name is Colt has to say after all with
          nav's ability they can escape whenever they want and what they heard
          shocked them the king is already born of course Colt proposes the deal
          that they heal the queen and he will give them even more information
          they took some doctors and Chimera ant Specialists and went to the
          Chimera ant nest since the king had moved away they expected to not
          have a lot of ants but they are all on guard it is too quiet suddenly
          they hear footsteps and Morel nav and Neo are immediately on guard
          after all no matter how much they believe Colt story they will never
          let their guard down in an enemy's territory after all even though
          they have already verified with different methods that colt was being
          truthful they are experienced hunters and it isn't too strange for
          someone to trick their Messenger to have an edge over the enemy Neo's
          physique has also changed and it's closer to his prime now his elderly
          thin body has gotten more muscular and he cut his beard shorter he is
          also wearing his lucky heart shirt now suddenly Colt gets a nervous
          look on his face he uses signals to try and determine if it is some
          other Chimera ant but the results shocked him he is able to determine
          that it is unlikely to be an ant as it didn't receive the signal
          suddenly out of the corner out of nowhere comes Jax they are a little
          shocked except Neo who simply says so I guess that you won our little
          game didn't you Jax Just Smiles at this yep as soon as the queen was
          reported to be dying the Squadron leaders tried to leave but I decided
          to not just let them out in the world so I killed them all in here
          sadly some were able to run away successfully then Jax's smile turns
          malicious I can't wait to hear about their reappearance so I can
          slaughter them all they were pretty arrogant when I came here but they
          immediately had their tails between their legs and ran away 2 seconds
          later haahahaha when Colt hears this he feels uncomfortable and A
          tingle in his spine he doesn't understand what is going on here his
          instincts are somehow warning him but he can't feel anything above a
          normal human of the man in front of him even his Aura seems about as
          average as a normal human ho ho ho Neo laughs wholeheartedly at this
          he is amused by Jax's way of acting he then Strokes his chin since he
          has cut his beard now so Jax is the queen alive Jax shrugs at this and
          answers yep but she is pretty close to death I didn't really kill her
          yet due to wanting to know the location of the king Neo's expression
          becomes serious as he says well then let's get there quickly before
          she dies Jax yawns at this and starts walking away out of the nest
          well you guys do you I have better things to do than try to save an
          already dead Chimera and queen he already saw the look that Neo has in
          his eyes no matter what the queen will not be walking out alive they
          just want to know something like the N abilities of the king or one of
          his Royal Guards so they will act like they are saving the queen in
          front of Colt whether they kill Colt later depends Neo looks at Jax's
          back as he walks away H there is not even a speck of blood on him or
          the walls it must be his hatsu ability I wonder what it is I guess I
          will just wait for the attack on the palace that time I can fight the
          king also I copied some nice abilities from the Chimera ants thinks
          Jacks as he takes out his his tablet and looks at his stats chapter 41
          Jax conjures his tablet there are quite a lot of apps but he clicks on
          the stats app and looks at his stats Jax Miller age 30 Talent LVL
          12128 exp exp 3933 St Str LVL 103,2 exp AG LVL 1080 3,200 exp and LVL
          111 156,00 exp n amount LVL 111 16,400 exp Jax looks at his stats with
          a fond look in his eyes a level 10 is the representation that that
          stat is as strong as marum and level 10 in Talent signifies that he
          has as much talent has gone in kilua meaning one in a 10 million but a
          talent 12 means one in aill ion talent but that is not talent in just
          nen it signifies talent in everything from cooking to even playing
          chess it can easily be said that Jax is the most talented human in
          every category after almost people who have rare talent in something
          are not likely to Discover It Jax then just dissolves his tablet back
          into nen it seems like I will have to wait a little more till I can
          level up Talent again I have understood that the other stats are trash
          compared to the talent stat thanks Jax contemplating the different
          stats Talent has made him able to copy others abilities as long as he
          understands how they work what does the next level in talent mean does
          it mean that I can copy any in power I see or something like that what
          about after that maybe I will reach a level of talent where I can copy
          an inability as complicated as future sight conspired Jax planning to
          spend most of his exp on his talent after all the other stats can be
          raised especially when someone is talented 2 Days Later Jack's POV I
          am currently in the city and look around as Morel eliminates The
          People Under patu's Control since leol and chidu are already dead by
          my hand Morel has no problems easily handling the situation but
          currently I am more concentrated on patu's control ability she is a
          specialist and having only an 80% Affinity in manipulation her ability
          is amazing for an 80% I mean she is likely around found as good at her
          manipulation men as alumi zic who is a natural manipulator at 100%
          Affinity I mean pitu seems to have more finesse at making her
          controlled targets better for fighting like with kite while alumi
          seems to be better than her with subtle manipulation like he did with
          kilua Anin truly has Limitless potential as long as you are creative
          with it also the fighting stops when the puppets all stop moving so it
          seems like Patu used her ability to heal the King which requires her
          to enter a state of almost zetsu to use So currently the king and
          kamugi are playing so the King still ripped off his arm this means
          that the king will develop feelings for kamugi this could be useful 7
          days later I am currently just observing outside of the palace looking
          for any subtle sign of movement phone ring suddenly my phone rings and
          I pick it up it is an O type flipped phone I know I see that the
          number is unknown but I still opened it and said hello Jax here out of
          the other side Comes A Familiar sounding voice ho ho ho Jax I hope you
          are up for another game I smile at this what would you like to play at
          old man nro how about we meet 2 hours later at the Ravine close to the
          castle asked Metro I just thought for a second and decided to accept
          General POV after 2 hours Jax went to the empty Ravine and there he
          sees Neo meditating there seems to also be another old man next to Neo
          who seems to be meditating too Jax immediately notices that he knows
          him from the anime the other old man is Zeno zoldik killua's
          grandfather Jax also sees that Neo is in even better shape than before
          his muscles were all pronounced his n too felt silent almost like
          Jax's but at the same not alike at all unlike Jack's nin silence who
          hides his Menin completely and even makes him seem like a normal
          person if he wants to NEOS n silence is completely different it allows
          his attacks to not be read through it all making his moves
          unpredictable by just observing his Aura Jax just looks at what Neo is
          doing with his nen with this it becomes unpredictable for the enemy to
          predict your moves I wonder if Jax closes his eyes and his men starts
          to move strangely before it is settled down it spikes to its full
          power for a split second but it doesn't bother neither ero nor Zeno
          zoric who has had contact with death so much that he doesn't fear it
          anymore so Jack says Ora doesn't bother him at all when Jack sees this
          he can't help but crack a joke at them you trying to find some
          Enlightenment in your ages Zeno opens his eyes and simply looks at Jax
          with a neutral face contrary to this Neo has a full-on smile when he
          sees Jacks he jacks I have a plan on how to handle the Chimera ants
          says Neo with a jovial tone in his voice Jack shrugs at this is it
          some type of sneak attack where you fight the king Neo does an okay
          sign yep I am going to go off with a firework so you plan to die then
          H says Jax as a matter of factly already knowing the answer haahaha
          Meto just laughs loudly at Jax's Proclamation yep I am getting older
          and older I will most likely die in bed one of these days that sounds
          absolutely terrifying to me so I am planning to give it my all and
          possibly die against the king ho ho ho Jax just raises an eyebrow at
          this so then what do you want me to do then old man Neo's face gets
          serious as he says with a serious voice I want you to keep the Royal
          Guards away I know I can kill the king even if I was to die when Neo
          says that most people who use n would assume that he has some type of
          Last Resort Revenge Type ability maybe with the condition of his own
          death but Jax knows better than that he did see the anime after all
          what Neo means is an atomic bomb inside of himself one day later
          Jack's POV you know I have my own metal dragon made out of needles but
          I decided to fly on Zeno's Dragon I didn't want to waste any
          unnecessary men today we are way above the Cloud so we can't be seen
          or noticed by Pit's Ian range then Neo starts counting down 3 2 1 go
          Zeno creates an N dragon as we all start floating down on its back I
          look down and see pitu in a pillar she had an excited look on her face
          when she sees the dragon when her Ian makes contact with Zeno's Dragon
          Patu turns off her Ian and starts going into complete battle mode
          ready to jump towards us but Boom the pillar under pitu breaks down
          unable to handle the power exerted into it as she jumps towards us I
          just jump from the dragon and dive down towards pitu Zeno uses this
          chance to use Dragon dive splitting his big men Dragon into thousands
          of miniature dragons attacking the whole Palace pitu still comes
          towards me since she can't change directions madir as she is an arms
          length away Pow with swift kick I hit her in the stomach making her
          spit out blood as flash she flies backwards outside of the palace
          boundary hope you don't interfere anymore Little Ant I say already
          knowing how this will end she survived my full power kick as expected
          of a chimera ant I contemplate calculating my next actions chapter 42
          I kicked pitu away to stop her from interfering her body flies away at
          Breakneck speeds I mean even at my level if she interferes in a battle
          it is likely to interrupt my fighting Rhythm and even I am likely to
          get killed by the king because of that this battle isn't something
          where I am absolutely sure of winning with interference these actions
          all happened in less than a second me Neo and Zeno all graciously land
          on the ground in a split second we all use Ian to try and sense the
          kingk location I know notice that pitu is trying to sense the location
          too as she used Ian also immediately we all sense where the king is he
          is at one of the towers holding someone injured in his arms we all
          calmly walk towards the tower the first thing I see is as expected
          everything is going to plan up till now I don't take action because
          this isn't the best time even though I will most likely be able to
          kill the king in seconds if I attack right now but unlike me who has a
          logical reason to not interfere I see that Z and nro can't help but
          not interfere in the scene in front of them the king is in front of
          them he is holding the girl kogi in his arms as she bleeds from her
          side as they are both surrounded by a wrecked Tower the king's State
          of Mind can easily be told by the erratic way his Aura moves they
          stopped at this was mostly due to the girl kamuki splattered in blood
          from an injury on her side the second reason that they stopped was due
          to the grotesque creature the king embracing kogi's body full of
          unmistakable tenderness if I was them right now would be the best time
          for an allout attack especially since a little cat will arrive soon
          flash suddenly out of the window pitu arrives she looks at Mar and
          then at me I noticed that she hasn't even bothered to heal herself
          from my attack she even has blood continuously coming out of her mouth
          talk about dumb dedication to a King ha the kingk expression soon
          returns to normal but I did notice that Pit's anxiety heightened as
          the king just looks at her and says pitu when she hears her name
          called pitu just looks at the king and says yes your majesty expecting
          the kingk orders the king just said in a compelling voice heal kugi I
          am counting on you I see that pitu immediately moves as soon as the
          king says that she even has tears of joy probably from some stupid
          sense of accomplishments shees doesn't she know that her King was dumb
          enough to spend too much time playing games and didn't investigate
          Humanity's power I mean a liter all hugle this world's Google search
          will tell you what Humanity's strongest weapon is also at this time
          Zeno and Neo seem to just be standing by not doing anything so I take
          the initiative by asking with a serious look on my face ant king shall
          you change your location it would be beneficial for all of us the king
          doesn't say a word about this but he just nods at this exact Time pitu
          released her ability Dr ble for that Split Second Zeno and Neo were
          distracted by it that is all the king needed as he just simply walked
          past through both of them before they even noticed maruan could have
          killed both of them in that Split Second when they were distracted but
          he didn't it was mostly a show of respect to them too as they didn't
          attack when he was holding kamugi but contrary to the old man I just
          looked the king straight in the eyes I smiled at him I got no reaction
          action in return as I just walked outside to Zeno made an End Dragon
          for Neo and the King to use it to travel to the fighting Place Zeno
          also made sure to keep his Aura extremely neutral as he did so and so
          the king flies away with Neo Zeno stays behind I just look at pitu
          healing kugi I walk towards them pitu immediately takes the protective
          position over kugi even though she is forced into a state of zetsu due
          to her an inability having the condition for activation I just walk so
          close to her that I am only 1 Meer away and say you are still an enemy
          so don't resist this or I will kill you and the girl I conjure a thin
          needle which is almost unseen by the normal eye and I casually throw
          the needle towards her forehead flash it pierces patu's forehead
          without problem even though pitu has a nervous look on her face with
          sweat on her forehead and rigid limbs I just yawned at this and
          started walking away leaving behind a slightly conf fuse Patu when
          outside I see that Zeno is still here so I ask what are you going to
          do next Xeno just looks at me I finished my job of separating the king
          from his Royal Guards I have completed my part of the contract I just
          shrug my shoulders at his answer and I start walking away well I guess
          I will hunt some ants now that I don't have anything better to do I
          use my en for a split second again in sense Gan and Kila running
          around towards patu Morel trapped poof with his Smoky jail knuckle has
          also used his ability against yuppi shoot and nuck seem to be having
          some problems but whatever H well not my problem 49 minutes later
          General P flash Jax kills even more Chimera ants as he casually
          strolls around the castle thinks Jax counting the Chimera ants killed
          by him he has already exterminated most of them already there are only
          a couple of them who might be hiding underground or Flying high in the
          sky Jax uses Ian again spreading his Aura in a perfect circular motion
          sensing even side if it h So Gone and pitu went away think Jax as he
          just goes towards the tower where a confused kamugi is just sitting
          around and scared Jax arrives at the tower at his top speed just a
          second later when kamugi hears this she asks around s Sue leader I is
          that you Jax doesn't answer her at all talking with her anymore would
          be useless kogi asks again Su flash Jax disappears in a Flash and
          before she can finish kogi's head flies off and it is caught by Jax as
          her neck spouts out blood and falls off like a puppet with its strings
          cut off her body lays there dying with her last thoughts being about
          the Supreme Leader which she didn't even know the name of on the other
          side in a tomb maram who has his full concentration fighting Neo and
          getting hit repeatedly suddenly he feels a heaviness in his heart what
          is this feeling thinks the king as he is hit by another one of Neo's
          attacks chapter 43 I grabbed kogi's head and summon a floating chest
          simply throwing the head inside poof and the chest pops out of
          existence this thing is very useful for storage it is truly convenient
          and useful also I sense poof and yuppi go towards where their King
          went welp I guess they will reach there in half an hour or more flying
          is truly convenient for covering large distances of travel during all
          of the time I have been in a palace I haven't really interfered that
          much with Gan kilua knuckle or any of the hunter battles because they
          are all unimportant to me and it doesn't even matter if they die plus
          I want poof and yuppi to go and look for Maru after some minutes of
          walking around I look to my left and see a centur like creature flying
          around it seems to have noticed me as it looks at me General POV yupi
          just looks at the human who is walking around with his hands in his
          pockets the human is up in a wrecked Tower while he is down below even
          though the human seems so normal his animalistic instincts scream that
          the human up there is dangerous no not just dangerous he is the most
          dangerous creature he has ever met even when compared to the the king
          that is impossible a human can make me feel like this thinks yuppi as
          he suddenly looks at his arm and sees that it is shaking in fear how
          can this be I am afraid of someone that feels so average suddenly he
          hears a voice that seems strangely playful you can go to your king now
          little Aunt as Jack says that contrary to even his expectations yuppi
          turns around his shield like thing on his arm that stores up his anger
          just flares a little suddenly Wings appear on his back as fash he
          flies away making the right decision by deciding to trust his
          instincts not knowing that he truly would have been killed in one shot
          if he didn't listen Jax just looks at yuppi as he runs away towards
          the king so it seems like soon I will have to fight the king before he
          dies thanks Jax contemplating different scenarios and outcomes of this
          simple battle his playful attitude is no longer here knowing that
          maram will easily surpass him in raw power soon that ability is way
          better than mine giving him so much strength just by eating the
          conditions and everything else really it is so much better than my
          gamer ability contemplates Jax already having everything in place to
          fight an even stronger morum he is glad knowing that the king will die
          soon no matter what so he can never grow enough to surpass him
          suddenly Jack asmin overflows around the palace stopping everyone one
          in place as they suddenly see a giant metallic Chinese dragon fly away
          Jax is at top the dragon too as it flies away under his command he
          sees the palace disappear behind him as he flies towards the place
          where he will meet the ant king halfway to the Palace everything is in
          place and everything has been planned for on the other side poof and
          yupi look for their King in the Flaming hell that surrounds them they
          scream for their King as poof flies in the sky and yuppi uses his
          Hooves to stop on the mold hot around together with tentacles with
          eyes as he tries to look for the king they search for 15 minutes when
          they suddenly fund the ant king poof is still flying around the
          perimeter in case the king got blown away by the explosion but
          suddenly ah a deep monstrous howl is heard into the fiery land Poof's
          heart immediately stops as yup's howl is all he needs for his worst
          fears to be confirmed Poof's face is already covered in tears even
          before he even sees the body immediately when his many clones go by
          and see the thing in yupp's arms he too can't help but howl no my king
          he sees that the kingk body is completely molten he has no arms or
          legs and cannot seem to talk but there is still life on him tears come
          out of yupp's eyes he can see that his King is infinitely close to
          truly dying but poof has a different idea as his body starts releasing
          in the cells that he uses to make clones and he uses them to spy this
          time he closes his eyes and thinks oh cells of mine give yourself to
          heal the king as the king starts getting better yupi also turns his
          cells into liquid to give to them too after that process slowly the
          king easily walks through the fire and smoke poof and yuppi whose
          bodies have now turned into miniature versions of themselves have
          giant Smiles on their faces his heartbeat his power his whole body is
          better now he has gotten stronger thinks poof glad that he can at
          least help the king be stronger like that yuppi on the other hand had
          a strange reaction the king is stronger than that human now once he
          was reassured of that yupi things on the more important things
          happening in front of him but more importantly why is it that the king
          seems confused in another place close by Jax is sitting upon a pillar
          of rock his hair is slicked backwards and he is wearing glasses again
          but these reading glasses aren't normal they are the ones created by
          his n as a form of observation and supercomputer the king most likely
          already has raw power over me now truly frightening that thing
          surpassed my Decades of hard work in a simple motion of days I am no
          longer a match to him in raw power but I have something that he
          doesn't have though and that is my knowledge of Technology on my side
          thankfully the ant king spent his free time playing gungi instead of
          learning about Humanity's strength analyses Jax already knowing that
          gungi did help the king win against Neto but that is only because of
          his intelligence to be able to turn a game like gungi into a fighting
          strategy though he used the simple strategy of always attacking he
          still had to remember every sequence of attacks that nro did so he
          will attack him again in another way to reveal a new move from Neo he
          then will keep perfecting his rhythm to slip right through Neo's guard
          a simple but terrifying strategy that will only work for the king as
          he can essentially defeat anyone like Neo by using this method that is
          a dangerous intelligence that he has going on for himself thanks Jax
          as his men flares around him like a perfect flowing black fire he has
          already sensed the king coming towards here he knows that he can't
          necessarily outsmart marum but his glasses are like a supercomputer
          something like a fleshy brain will never be able to keep up with its
          calculating power even if the King was 100x smarter he won't even get
          to the 0 1% of the calculating power of a supercomputer as the king is
          flying closer and closer to him Jax just simply takes his hands out of
          his pocket and gets up he has to also end this battle fast too or he
          might get poisoned too so Jax just looks at the king and his two
          little mini Royal Guards the king stops when he sees Jax and senses
          his nen are you going to stop me asks the king already predicting what
          Jax is going to do but he still asked just to be sure Jax just looks
          at the king flying so close to him but he still simply answers with a
          simple yes chapter 44 as soon as Jax gives his confirmation of his
          actions the king's orat explodes out of his body I see then I will
          kill you says the king not even wanting to discuss anything anymore
          with Jax flash he immediately disappeared from his place leaving yuppi
          and poof behind Jax's eyes narrow as he disappeared to and dodged
          maron's attacks by jumping back everything around them is not moving
          anymore as their speeds have long since surpassed the speed of sound
          their exchanges are silent poof and yuppi can't see anything at all
          jaxs and the King are in their own world as the king attacks using
          kicks with terrifying power behind but Jax uses different hatus
          together so even though the king is faster than him he can still keep
          up with him hundreds of blows happened within a second until boom
          until one of them crashes into the ground as the dust clears up Jax
          walks out of it he has a surprised look on his face the king just
          surpassed a super computer and beat Jax burst and Jax's arm falls on
          the ground he looks ever more surprised so fast at that last hit I
          didn't see anything thinks Jax as the king's speed suddenly surpassed
          him by a far reach did he read my rhythm already but it hasn't even
          been a second Dam the king looks at Jax due to having Poof's ability
          he can also read Jax's emotional state you seem surprised says the
          king stating the fact but you are not afraid I wonder why that is Jax
          looks at his stump of an arm it is cut at the middle of his arm it
          wasn't even neatly cut it was more like ripped away Jax looks back at
          the king who has a little blood on his fingers the only thing
          signifying how he ripped off the arm I am not scared of you you are
          already dead so being afraid of a dead and isn't exactly human nature
          says Jax casually while this surprised yuppi and poof as tears
          appeared in their eyes this must be a lie thought both of them as they
          turn to look at their King however marum still has a calm look on his
          face as expected of marum sama he is absolutely calm think both yuppi
          and poof not wanting to believe that their King will just die like
          this but their hearts are broken when they hear maru's next words I
          see then so as suspected I am already poisoned you most likely already
          know that it is contagious so your plan must be to finish me off
          before you two are poisoned H you have around a minute and a half at
          best says the king calmly analyzing Jax's actions he no longer seems
          interested in fighting Jax he seems to want to just understand him
          after all he will die and doesn't have his memories Jax Just Smiles at
          this he understands that the king truly has nothing now he is curious
          like a newborn suddenly his severed arm levitates towards him and he
          pots his stump aside and it connects slowly needles come out of his
          severed arm that is how he was able to levitate it towards him the
          needles slowly change shape turning into staple like form and they
          clamp together Jax's arm then he just clutches his previously cut off
          arm forming it into a fist H this will have to do says Jax completely
          relaxed his expression is calm like always he looks back at the king
          how were you able to read through my rhythm AR room the King seems a
          little surprised as Jax called him by his name but he still answers to
          him as he floats down in front of Jax your Rhythm was very H how to
          express this your movements were very mechanical and easily
          predictable I simply moved faster at the last move and took off your
          arm though getting through your aura was a little hard Jack smirked at
          this you know if we met during different circumstances we could have
          been sparring partners Maru Chuckles at this you don't seem like the
          type of person to like people who are stronger than you haa Jax has a
          full out laughter when he hears morom say that after the laughter
          quiets down Jax just simply confirms that is true I hate people who
          are better than me at anything poof and yupi look at this weirdly when
          they see the king and Jacks who are supposed to be enemies acting so
          friendly with each other Jax just sze at this anyway I think that we
          should continue fighting again the king's smile disappears when he
          hears this you know that it is impossible for you to win against me
          that is when suddenly Jack starts laughing haahaha and King don't make
          the mistake of underestimating Humanity again you did so once and it
          cost you your life the king's face turns back into a smile again that
          is true but I feel as if I can't remember something important as if
          something very important is missing from the picture Jax Just Smiles
          at this as a cold glint appears on his eyes kamugi as soon as the king
          hears that his eyes widen representing his shock that is when Jax
          takes the chance and a knif likee needle appears on his hand flash he
          disappears and faster than anyone can perceive he goes for the throat
          of marum as his eyes are wide in shock and he is remembering things
          about him and kugi as the needle gets closer and closer to his throat
          a a vicious smile appears on Jax's face as the knife siiz needle is
          about to pierce the king but suddenly Jax's arm stops in its track
          just an inch away from the needle ripping into the king's throat man
          this sucks I haven't felt so outclassed in a long time thinks Jax as
          he looks at the king in the eyes the king no longer seems confused he
          has a Clarity in his eyes poof seems frustrated at this but there is
          nothing that he can do anymore the king already remembers kugi he used
          his clones to get rid of her dead headless body already but all of
          this is useless now the king already has the memories of kuki but
          contrary to the others thought process maram has other thoughts in his
          head kamugi wait for me I can finally tell you my name now chapter 45
          Maru stopped Jack's midt trck and he looks at him and says I don't
          have a lot of time so I will have to go and meet her one last time
          sorry but sadly you can't fight me anymore but I must thank you I am
          sorry but I do not know your name as Maron says that Jax just sze at
          this I guess I should give it my all too but I will have to make him
          move past his limits that will give me the best benefits as Jax thinks
          that he simply summons a box and opens it he puts his hand inside the
          box and says to marum did you know that there is a way to gain un
          imaginable Power by making the ultimate condition I bet that someone
          like you will reach quite far if he does so Maru seems to think of
          something when Jax says this so what are you getting at says marum a
          little confused by what Jax means to do next Jax just gives him a
          malicious smile it brings chills as it reminds him of a certain crazy
          old man marua may never underestimate the evil hidden inside a human's
          heart as Jax says that he pulls something out of the box it is the
          head of kugi who had turned blue and even smelled a little Maru just
          looked at it in shock W what have you done says marum completely in
          shock his mind comes to a halt as he contemplates the reality in front
          of him but Jax Just Smiles maliciously at Mor's expression well now
          that is quite hypocritical of you didn't you kill people before this
          too so please now use that rage and give up everything sacrifice
          everything that is the only way that you can avenge kugi says Jax as
          he clutches kugi dead head maram looks at this as tears come out of
          his eyes and no is all that he can say before burst kogi's head bursts
          like a watermelon man that face really suits a bug like you says Jax
          with a nonchalant expression on his face after all bugs shouldn't act
          so high and mighty they should beg to us humans not to squash them
          like the bugs they are immediately the king's Ian overflows all around
          like a flash of light it can even be compared to the speed of light as
          it envelopes all around the place Jax can't even change his expression
          and all he can see is a dark shadow approaching him but his men moves
          faster Jax who is a manipulator has the 1% chance of developing a
          specialist ability obviously someone like him already developed his
          specialist ability it is called perfect plan suddenly a slid appeared
          on Jax's head the eye was red and it had a brown clock instead of a
          pupil and at that moment maram noticed something strange his speed
          which some might call is something that is comparable to the speed of
          light and as he immediately went for Jax's head planning to kill him
          instantly but suddenly in an impossible scenario somehow Jax's head
          tilted to the side easily dodging maron's attack what he can't see me
          do to my speed how is is that even possible thinks Mar contemplating
          this as he decides to attack with a light fast kick but flash suddenly
          the king noticed something strange Jack's just staring blankly in
          front of him his eyes not following Mor's movements at all but Jax's
          body still moved to dodge his kick what is happening thinks marum as
          he sees the strange situation in front of him before when he went to
          his full speed in their first exchange for only a split second Jacks
          lost an arm but now he seems to be able to dodge the attacks perfectly
          is it some programmed response on action prediction thinks marum
          trying to figure out this new ability that Jax is using how is he
          doing it maram uses the ability that he got from yupi to be able to
          change his physical body so he uses this to turn his hands and feet
          and hands into claws his wings also gain steel like feathers but marum
          is not finished as his exoskeleton turns into a metallic like color
          his leg muscles expand and Flash he immediately appears before Jax
          again using his tail to try a sneak attack but as Maru expected Jax's
          dodged by jumping back slightly maram looks at this with cold eyes I
          have your ability figured out now suddenly out of his chest another
          hand appears and bomb it hits Jack in the chest but to marum even
          though they are moving at speeds way above sound he swears that he
          heard Jack simply say bad move little ant as Jax says this maron's
          hand who hit him is stuck in a pink like thing as soon as it touches
          Jax's abdomen Jax use his KO and concentrates all of his men in there
          to protect him from the devastating blow that would have most likely
          pierced right through him if it wasn't for Jacks using KO bungee gum
          slowly the small pink patch of n suddenly transforms into a bungee
          Gumball that completely encompasses marum the ant king immediately
          tries to punch his way out of this but due to bunge gum having the
          properties of both Rubber and gum it isn't easy to break through this
          type of transmuted nen morum punches one side of the ball and like
          rubber it extends due to the force applied and wash it Returns the
          attack back to morom who already attacked hundreds of times in that
          Split Second a drop of blood comes out of R's mouth signifying that he
          was hurt by something like this due to me being a natural manipulator
          I only have 40% Mastery in transmutation but with my aura amount being
          so much higher than hisoka's it has made the ability way stronger than
          Hoka it is at a level he is unlikely to ever reach thanks Jax finally
          able to get a breather he never even saw Maru move in any way he was
          only able to survive due to his ability perfect plan Jax can finally
          smile a little he was able to finally outthink Maron chapter 46 Maron
          just looks at Jax's he knows that he has been imprison completely this
          substance won't be easy to get out of it seems like I underestimated
          him I have five more minutes before I die I need to kill him at least
          before I die thinks marum as his mind is now back to being calm he
          wanted to die with kogi but he knows that it is impossible now Jax
          just looks at Mar and flash Jax casually kills both yuppi and poof
          with no effort at all just squashing them to death maram doesn't look
          surprised or sad at their deaths at all his reaction is to only take a
          deep breath Jax looks at morom one last time and he says an King you
          are lucky if the queen had landed anywhere else in the human world she
          would have been killed by the advanced Nations Jax just shakes his
          head again in disappointment you just simply got arrogant and assumed
          that this is all Humanity has to offer you are absolutely wrong
          humanity is so far along on its game that the ants never stood a
          chance continued Jax as he walked forward and got close to morom who
          was covered in the bungee gum bubble the ant king just looked at Jax
          calmly there is no anger or wavering of emotion on the ant kingk face
          suddenly the king pointed his arm towards Jacks his arm turns into an
          angry red color and swells and a mouth with rows of teeth appears on
          his palm Jax immediately jumped back slowly nin gathers at the mouth
          of Maru hand boom a roaring cannon in Blast shoots towards Jacks but
          Bungie gum stops the blast and the gum extends Maron notices this and
          he puts even more men into the blast making it strong enough to easily
          blow up a mountain pop the bungee gum bubble suddenly pops unable to
          handle the raw power that Maron uses but the blast didn't stop at that
          as it goes straight towards Jack's obliterating everything on his way
          when Jack sees this his eyes narrow a little at this this Blast has a
          wide range attack and can be dispersed if countered at a weak point
          analyses Jacks in a split second his body already knowing what to do
          but I already know the perfect plan on how to deal with this situation
          very fast needles are created from Jax Zora for form in countless
          miniature needles which Jax controls with just a wave of his hand the
          needles start combining together and form a pyramid with the point
          pointing towards the center of the N blast Jax just sigh at this a
          little surprised that this was actually the best move he would have
          used the cards from Greed Island to teleport next to morum and hit him
          with a sneak attack but that seems to be a move worse than the current
          one but after that one hour I will be especially vulnerable I could be
          poisoned in the ability just gives me the perfect decision in that one
          hour and no more but Jax then uses Ian and just like Mars it is as if
          a flash is activated he can sense everything within 10 km his Ian and
          maru's Ian are at the same level though Jax's Ian is way more refined
          and it forms a perfect circle unlike maron's irregular shaped one
          showing Jax's superiority in nen usage maram just uses his nen in its
          raw form without any finesse but Jax is the exact opposite he uses nen
          in such a controlled manner that it seems like a part of his body boom
          and as the nin beam hits Jax's shield made out of needles it shows
          this difference in nin usage when the beam hits the pyramid it
          immediately disperses in two parts and everything except where Jax is
          Maru frowns again unsure of how JX continues to see through his
          attacks this should have been a totally new attack that he shouldn't
          have predicted does his brain somehow process things at such a fast
          speed that as soon as he saw Min in Gather in my hand he predicted
          that it will be a ranged attack I had plans in case he somehow dodged
          my attack I can actually try to curve the attack to still hit him it
          was the perfect move made by Jax again contemplates morom trying to
          figure out what Jax is doing he has obviously noticed at the third eye
          on Jax's forehead has the pupil who seems like a clock does his
          ability have something to do with with Time guest marum time travel
          time Erasure no it is most likely future sight but even that doesn't
          explain him making the best possible move time travel would but that
          is impossible Mar's mind goes through thousands of scenarios and
          possibilities eliminating them as fast as they come he can see the
          future possible outcomes thinks morum as he comes to this decision but
          why when I use Poof's ability and sense emotions instead of Jack's
          having a conflicted feeling which everyone has when presented with a
          choice instead he has a feeling of absolute certainty Mor's terrifying
          intelligence was able to almost able to figure out Jax's specialist
          ability JAX on the other hand looked at morum straight in the eyes my
          ability is called perfect plan it allows me to see in the future for 1
          hour not just the future but the best future if I follow the actions
          of the future me I can make the best outcome possible as Jax says that
          the king's eyes widened in shock not at what Jax said because he
          already guessed that Jax's hatsu will be strong but what shocked him
          is that in Jax's forehead two other eyes appeared they both are red
          eyes with a brown pupil who looks like a clock he activated another
          ability as he explained that to me or was that a condition thinks
          marum as he comes to his conclusion his fight with Jax has allowed him
          to grow and look at nen in a different perspective I am stronger than
          Jax in every other category except Ora size which we are at the same
          level but I am going to die anyway so no need for me to even dwell to
          much on stuff like this suddenly the King has an absolute epistemic
          shock Jax can see the future with this then why should a little poison
          be so Troublesome for me I can just just like Patu did it to heal
          people boom Mar's n explodes at full power that is the Split Second
          Jax decided to attack chapter 47 maram just looked at Jax as he
          attacked him and even though he seems to display no emotion on the
          outside on the inside it is a totally different matter so perfect plan
          Isn't So Perfect after all thinks marum as suddenly his men stopped
          flowing out of him so it seems like his ability determined that it
          would be too dangerous for me to create a special ability hatsu and it
          was the best time to attack now what that says is that even if he
          predicted that who is the one really in control as soon as the king
          heard about Jax's ability he immediately made a countermeasure perfect
          plan can only choose the best option but that is where the flaw comes
          what if there are only two choices like when [ __ ] decided to create
          his hatsu special ability Jax could either attack or stay back his
          ability predicted that it was better to attack at that moment and not
          allow [ __ ] to create his abil it immediately gave marum knowledge
          that if he created his ability it would be dangerous for Jax also if
          he only allows a perfect option available one that is created by Him
          then perfect plan can be used against Jacks but I will need to finish
          this fast or else I will really die normally it would take a couple of
          hours for this poison to kill me but it has been shortened to minutes
          due to me being in high level movement all this time making my body
          more susceptible to the poison and making it move faster along my body
          analyses maram his mind coming up with thousands of actions that he
          can think of and deciding to take an action to make jackx do his
          Perfect action immediately moram goes on the offensive as Jax is
          coming towards him maram speed outclass Jax's but Jax still dodged
          just as marum expected so he used yup's ability and created fleshy
          tentacles behind his back each of them having a knife like Edge at the
          tip also two more pairs of arms appear making it a total of six arms
          plus with his metallic exoskeleton moram looks nothing like his
          previous self immediately before he can even finish his transformation
          and attack Jax Jax jumps back this being the perfect move possible at
          the moment but this made Jax be on the air so marum attacked him flash
          during this Split Second maram as he is using his Ian to sense
          everything within his surroundings he sens his needles punctuate Jacks
          to move him backwards flash seemingly dodging Mor's attacks but
          suddenly morom points towards Jax's cheek and says you have a small
          cut in there and truly a small cut appears on Jax's cheek maram Just
          Smiles at this it seems like your ability isn't something Almighty
          after all you did get hurt something that definitely was the perfect
          move for you but it means that any other move and you would have
          gotten worse than a small cut meaning that if you didn't have this
          ability you would have been dead a long time ago maru's nin expands
          again starting to create a hatsu special ability especially made to
          save him from the poison he is currently dying of but again Jax while
          using his needles levitates towards him and attacks confirming Mar's
          suspicion as he Dodges Jax's attacks but suddenly Jax's n transmuted
          into string and it wrapped around [ __ ] who easily broke out of it
          but he then is almost entrapped Again by a bun gum slingshot but at
          this time just as Mar is about to make another Dodge Jax just takes a
          deep breath and poof he breathes out smoke immediately surrounding
          marum he sees this and notices that Jax is right beside him ready to
          attack but suddenly Jax clasps his hands going for the attack a dark
          space appears between his hands he is using nav's ability and the king
          is confused as suddenly swash his arms on his left side all disappear
          but maram isn't panicking at all when he sees this he just jumps back
          his arms all regrow back as he uses yup's ability to create new ones
          immediately the king flies towards Jax again ready to attack Jax just
          gathers men towards his hand and says first comes Rock the king is
          immensely faster than him and is in front of Jack's butt Big Bang
          Attack and as maron's attack attack is about to hit him Jax just slips
          past it as a lightning Trail appears behind him and he surprises morom
          on that Split Second as he hits in the stomach but the King has
          already learned a lot from this battle as he took no damage due to
          having used KO to gather all of his Aura at the point of impact and
          together with his exoskeleton there was no damage inflicted to him but
          for Jax that was another story as the Tentacles from maru's back moved
          and with the blades at their tips flash but due to him using Ken to
          spread his nen and keep it steady like armor no major injuries
          appeared but he still can't defend completely from the attack as
          countless Cuts appear all around his body this is also another
          difference between them as maram has an exoskeleton he is unlikely to
          get any injuries like Jack's making his defense stronger especially
          with yupp's ability reinforcing it and even giving moram a crude form
          of regeneration as Jax is momentarily injured maram takes that chance
          to jump back Jax's reaction to not allowing me to create my special
          ability means that his perfect plan has already seen that I will
          succeed celebrates marum as his n jumps up and it gathers together to
          truly form its ability but suddenly Jax gets up and with its injured
          body he smiles and says putting a huge amount of nen in this ability
          allowing him to take it past its limits even though he has only 40%
          compatibility on transmuter nen he creates a huge sun and red armor
          cloak around him and as Maru sees this he can't help but be a little
          annoyed he stops creating his special ability which he has been doing
          a lot lately and he transforms all of his six hands into dark red as
          they bulk up and small moths appear on their palms huge amounts of nen
          are gathered into it and boom a huge nin beam goes to hit the
          miniature Sun that Jax just threw towards him but as marum was doing
          that out of the ground under him needles packed with powerful nen and
          they immedi go for Mor's head usually the chance of them hitting
          anything vital was almost impossible but with Jack still using perfect
          Plan F as the king turns to look at the needles while he is still
          attacking the miniature son the needles pierce his eyes chapter 48
          usually marum is able to sense something that moves with his ien as
          his n can sense any movement with it even while fighting but he didn't
          sense this meaning that they were here before the battle even started
          thinks marum as even while needles are stabbed into his eyeballs he
          has to suppress the pain and keep concentrating or else he will be hit
          by the giant son made of nen if he stops his blast he just closes his
          eyelids to stop the needles moving any further and making his brain
          into mush when Jack senses this using his Ian he can't help but smile
          a little at this though perfect plan can only be used once a month it
          doesn't mean that I am stupid enough to not prepare the battlefield in
          my favor and make a new move that the perfect plan can calculate to
          make it perfect in a scenario as suddenly out of the ground hundreds
          of more needles come out and stab him most of them obviously can't
          penetrate his exoskeleton but the joints are still open a little and
          slash one of the legs of marum is cut off so he immediately decides to
          stop his beam and use yupp's ability to create bulky armor around
          himself boom as the sun made out of men hits him and while this move
          has extremely high attack power plus with it being packed with strong
          men made it dangerous even though it is at 40% suddenly Mor noticed
          with his Yen that even while the heat around him was trying to burn
          him though it's not doing any danger to him his new bulky exoskeleton
          is keeping him 100% safe but his armor still got softer just like
          metal does when it is heated up Suddenly even in the heat countless
          needles as big as the average human assaulted him trying to pierce him
          suddenly one of them appears on his back and unlike the others it is
          just hovering in there Jack smirks at this it seems like you still
          underestimate me moram even after all this time fighting against me
          thinks Jax as he summons his chest and puts on a ring he then calls
          out book poof a book appears it is the book of the Greed Island flash
          suddenly a giant amount of nin gathers on Jax's Fist and he starts
          rotating his arm at incredible speed eats and every time he does so
          his nen spikes up and as his right hand is full of menen Jax takes out
          a card from the book and says accompany on marum fash immediately he
          disappeared and appeared inside of the Heat next to moram who is
          covered in exoskeleton due to his pain Packer armor he doesn't take
          any damage from it Jack's just floats towards the Giant needs pointing
          towards morum and BM he punches the needle Boom the exoskeleton is
          easily pierced Jax immediately moves away from it his perfect plan
          already saw the outcome of this slowly as the heat dies off the
          exoskeleton is just there as big as a car and it has cracks all around
          it and the needle is still sticking out of it crack suddenly just like
          an egg the exoskeleton falls off on the ground revealing morom with a
          needle piercing his chest cough he coughs and a huge ount of dark blue
          blood comes out of his mouth he uses his six hands to try and take off
          the giant giant needle as big as a pillar piercing him on the chest
          his body barely holding itself together his Ian settles down and comes
          back to his body that is when Jax's finger twitches and Flash
          thousands of big needles Pierce him the king just looks at Jax due to
          maron's lungs being already destroyed he cannot talk at all and he can
          feel feel his life fleeing but his last thoughts weren't of his hate
          about Jacks nor was it about his subordinates kamugi I wish I could
          play one more gungi game with you do you think that that we might be
          able to play one last time in the afterlife and then Mar's body goes
          limp as he dies just like that the king died without saying anything
          and full of regrets he was unable to kill the human in front of him
          JAX on the other hand just smirked at this he didn't care what the
          King was thinking whether he was regretful or not and as soon as the
          king died flash Jax appeared next to the king with his tablet already
          conjured he then touches the king and then maru's body slowly turns
          into Sparkles of light and like water flowing into his tablet after
          that Jax immediately opened his tablet and clicked into the stats app
          Jax Miller age 30 Talent LVL 12128 exp EX P 39331 18321 St Str LVL 10
          53200 exp AG LVL 10832 exp n LVL 11156 400 exp n amount LVL 111 16,400
          exp ha immediately maniacal laughter comes out of Jack his body
          shaking out of joy as monstrous and violent Aura flows out of his body
          no longer showing any of his control as his feelings surfaced all of
          this battle only lasted under 5 minutes showing the speed that they
          were both moving at was incomprehensible Jack's Aura rises even higher
          as it slowly gains a red tinge to it he then pulls out a card from his
          book and says a company on gone a his laughter still Echoes as he
          flies off towards where Gan is on the other hand Gan is unconscious in
          killua's back his body seems all thin and dried out as if he would die
          soon when flash suddenly out of nowhere in a bright flash Jax appears
          next to them he just looks at them kilua is immediately freaked out
          after all Jax never has always been mysterious also even though his
          body seems uninjured his suit that he usually wears in perfect form is
          ruined it seems to barely hold itself together Jax frowns as his eyes
          wander towards gone so he did something stupid it seems removing the
          limiter is a fate worse than death for some people even if he is
          healed he will never use n again says Jax with a frown on his face
          suddenly he just says book poof and the Greed Island book appears
          which surprises kilowa extremely after all that is impossible to use
          out outside of Greed Island suddenly he pulls a card kilua was
          familiar with and Jax casually says Angel's breath and the figure of
          an Angel appears and it blows a breath towards gone using it on him
          chapter 49 Jack's POV Angel's breath as I use the card on Dawn I
          noticed that as the angel-like figure appears and blows a breath
          towards gwn but it has no effect I immediately noticed the problem it
          is his own men it's cursing him and the curse is no joke either though
          I personally do have some ways to exercise Nan I even have one who
          might possibly save gone but it has so many conditions and it can only
          be used on myself so really I don't have any way to save him when
          kilua sees that Angel's breath has no effect on it he looks at me with
          a desperate look on his eyes trying to see if I have some solution to
          this but I just shake my head killua's head hangs down and he goes
          running again as he does so I say to him go towards the palace there
          the hunters Association will arrive soon so there should be some
          medical staff arriving gone can't die yet I still owe him a favor
          after that he doesn't stop but I already know that he heard me he
          immediately activates his and starts running towards the palace whom I
          wanted marum to release his limiter too just like Gan did after all
          that might give me more EXP from that but it seems like it isn't that
          easy to do so even with my perfect outcome moram didn't release his
          limiter I just shrug at this and keep walking opposite to him and
          towards where the fight between Gan and pitu happened my perfect plan
          is still active meaning that I can see the perfect plan for the next
          24 hours I just walk around and see that a part of the forest is wiped
          out there are also broken trees and all that hm that is some pretty
          good damage around here I wonder if gone could have really won against
          the King pruk when he was in that form obviously the King has his
          intelligence and exoskeleton to his Advantage but gonu has experience
          and usage of nen his jenin is an advantage too maruan is a fast
          learner but at the same time he is one of the worst n users ever he
          just throws it around like a dumus he never trained in nen and was
          just born with it so that is also why I call him one of the worst user
          of nen when I arrive at the place where I assume gone killed pitu it
          is next to a broken giant tree I look for any ant body part but I
          can't find any sigh as perfect plan predicted there is nothing here
          talk about a waste of time but the future Mii is still just wandering
          around here okay now I see that he just turned back and went towards
          outside of NGL I conjure my needle dragon and immediately start flying
          away it takes me almost an hour to reach the place it is a city just
          outside of NGL yeah I know what I have to do now this is the city
          where I left Mikasa so I find the house that I bought for her to stay
          while she awaits my return as I enter I see masasa in a pile of books
          reading it seems to be some cooking book General POV Mikasa just looks
          at Jax in her eyes there is a certain light that wasn't there before
          he looks at the book that she is reading it's a book with the title
          how to cook the best chicken chicken is mik favorite food think Jax as
          he observes mikasa's body language Jax smiled a little at this so you
          are back Mikasa Mikasa just turns around and looks at Jax in the eyes
          kind of my memory is very fuzzy it feels as if there is a Darkness
          around them was I dead her eyes are blank like always her silver hair
          Jax observes all of this taking in her body language yep so tell me
          how was death like Mikasa just looked down at her hands displaying a
          panicked look on her face and she starts Breathing heavily death was
          absolutely terrifying there is no afterlife I didn't even feel
          anything it felt just like I blinked my eyes I couldn't remember
          anything when I woke up 2 days ago so when we die we disappear H says
          Mikasa as she looks at Jax with desperate eyes what do you think about
          death Jax Sensei Jax just walks toward WS Mikasa and pets her head
          don't worry about such useless things like death as long as you are
          strong enough you won't die masasa just relaxes as Jax pets her but
          she still seems unsure of this but no one can beat old age no matter
          how strong someone is Jax Just Smiles at this I wouldn't be so sure of
          that the dark continent is full of strange stuff there even exists a
          type of grass which can extend your lifespan Mikasa just shakes her
          head at this my body is already dead I am not worried about old age
          anymore my new hatsu seems to stop my aging Jax just keeps patting her
          head and with each Pat it gets harder as Mikasa even winces at a
          couple of them Mikasa you have me here so there is no need to be
          afraid of someone stronger than me appearing says Jax with a smile on
          his face but on his head he had another thought this is not mikaza it
          is just the thing getting her memories it is most likely her hatsu
          evolving and gaining intelligence to protect me better after a couple
          of days during the selection for the new chairman Hoka is just
          standing in there calculating how powerful the hunters in there are he
          keeps trying to accurately determine their power the tiger zodiac
          canai just looks at hisoka annoyed get out of here you are an isce or
          Hoka says Kai the Sheep zodiac ginto looks at this differently he is
          here to determine our strengths that is when suddenly a voice comes
          and says hey there hope I am not late Pon the rabbit zodiac looks at
          this and jumps up yay Jax is here Jax just comes out of the Shadows he
          has his glasses on and is wearing a suit then Pon immediately points
          towards Hoka and says Jack killed at Hoka he is being a meanie he is
          just standing there like a creep Jax just laughs at this hahahaha peon
          don't be so rude I am sure that Hoka means nothing by it he then looks
          at Hoka right Hoka asks Jax as he looks at Hoka whose eyes are
          completely wide I I can't see anything but he is dangerous he has
          gotten stronger thinks Hoka remembering the last time he met Jax it
          was during Greed Island chapter 50 Hoka just looks at Jax he can feel
          his blood boil his instincts screaming at him ah he is even stronger
          now thinks Hoka as he looks at Jax I can't sense anything but his
          power is terrifying his Ola looks around no one else notices not even
          I can but my instincts are screaming right Hoka says Jax Hoka finally
          comes out of his stuper he notices that Jack's just asked him if he is
          causing trouble or something he wasn't really concentrating on what
          was being said Hoka just gets up and shrugs well I wasn't really
          bothering anyone he just looks at Jax and a smile appears on hisoka's
          face want to fight asks Hoka as he looks at Jax's nonchalant eyes Jax
          just scratches the back of his head h sure I guess just got to make it
          fast then Hoka smiles and goes to grab a card but fash his eyes widen
          as he feels someone softly gripping the back of his neck W what thinks
          Hoka as he sees that Jax is no longer in front of him his body is
          filled in cold sweat like a prey afraid of the Predator he couldn't
          even take out a card and was defeated hissoka just sigh at this and
          puts his hands up I give up Hoka even though he lost he has a smile on
          his face so it seems like I am not that strong his rubberlike n
          naturally acted to this flowing out of his body and fash flying
          towards Jacks but he is no longer behind him Hoka feels a voice behind
          him again say well that is that then see you later Hoka I am just
          going to vote now ywn Hoka looks at this with a complicated look on
          his face he doesn't even see me as a threat at all well he did give me
          A New Perspective but Hoka and Jax aren't the only people in the room
          The Zodiacs are also surprised at how strong Jax really is obviously
          as a three- star hunter he truly has to be strong but this strength he
          is the strongest Hunter on here think all of the hunters inside the
          voting room Jax just walks casually towards the box and puts in a
          paper with the name Cheeto Yorkshire Hoka then just starts walking
          towards the exit upstairs clack clack but that is when he hears a
          puppet like clacking sound he looks at where the sound is coming in
          out and alumi in his disguise comes out 95 foot calculates Hoka but
          even this good number it still makes alumi seem too boring when
          compared to Jax as Jax voted Mikasa walks past him and votes too Hoka
          ALS o gives Mikasa a side glance while he is talking with alumi he is
          a little shocked at her change and she can feel that she is extremely
          dangerous compared to before where she used to be only about his level
          and he was confident in defeating her he looks at Jax again is he the
          one who made her like this another two days pass and the Gathering of
          all of the hunters is held parison wins with the votes but Jax doesn't
          seem interested in this at all as he just looks at Jing trying to
          determine how much raw power he has way weaker than me that is the
          conclusion that Jax comes up with how much weaker than him well no one
          wonders to know how much weaker in raw power a bug is but people are
          still careful if it is poisonous that is why Jax analyses and wonders
          how many hatsu Jing has that might make him a threat after all a n
          battle isn't just raw power he knows that the best especially with how
          he defeated morum but he still can't use perfect plan in another month
          that is when suddenly everyone in the room stops for a second everyone
          but Jacks that is as he just frowns a little as expected some things
          are still dangerous to me nanica that thing is really dangerous thinks
          Jax already knowing that this is the result of nanah healing gone
          after some time bang the doors of the room of the hall opened all of
          the hunters turn around to look at the perpetrator it is gone with
          tears on his eyes when Leo Rio sees this he just immediately jumps off
          the stage screaming goon they have their tearful greeting and that is
          when Don looks at his father and calls out Jing immediately Jan
          cringes at this he seems uncomfortable at it and that is when Jack
          Smiles a little and says come on now Jing is your hatsu being a dead
          beat dad or something there is a second of Silence as then everyone
          started laughing haahaha Jing maybe the condition is not to see your
          son maybe that is why you are so strong hahahaha Jing what is your
          hatsu called being a shtt y Dad no wonder he is a zodiac the htty Y
          dad Hunter haah Jing seems annoyed by this TCH shut the hell up Jack
          Jax's smile widens even more as he gets up and dramatically says Ah as
          expected of a deadbeat dad his vocabulary is not that developed Jax
          looks at Jin with a pitiful look on his face no wonder we all
          understand Jan gains an annoyed look on his face that is when Jax
          couldn't hold it anymore and starts laughing haahaha and everyone
          follows suit even some of the more stoic Hunters chuckle a little at
          this Gan who is still wearing his Hospital clothes gets close to Jing
          Jing just looks at gone and casually says yo gan's eyes tear up even
          more as he runs to the front row where Jing is sitting and says I am
          sorry it was my fault because of me kite turned into a little girl
          Jing doesn't know what to say at this so he just shrinks a little and
          says uh I heard that kite was captured by the enemy gone nods at this
          and starts explaining yes I was with kite then he told me to run away
          and pitu showed up kite got his arm chopped off I was knocked out and
          then we trained sho got kite out of the Chimera ant's Nest but it
          wasn't kite they did all kinds of horrible things Jing's face just
          Narrows not knowing at all what to say and he seems extremely
          uncomfortable he doesn't even understand what is being said he doesn't
          even know who shu is but gone still continues saying as even more
          tears k out of his eyes and when I meet pitu again pitu said that kite
          was already dead his eyes fill up as even more tears flow out of them
          he is full out crying now Jing not knowing what to do he finally says
          Ah okay I get it well I don't get it but just have a seat okay he Pats
          the empty seat next to him Jing still doesn't know how to handle a
          crying child so he just waves his hand and says so or let's calm down
          we should both try to calm down but gone still is cry trying his eyes
          out it was because I insisted sniff on having my way snot starts
          coming out of gon's nose Jing still is unsure of the correct thing to
          say as he tries to reason with gone oh um a a anyway just calm down
          first two of the hunters one with blonde hair who looks like a kid and
          the other who has bushy brown hair and an extremely average face they
          are two of the hunters who help Jane create Greed Island they are
          surprised at how nervous Jing is Jing is Jing is actually nervous and
          flustered Gan still continues saying as even more snot comes out of
          his nose I should have been the one who died when gone says that that
          is the moment Jing's face gets serious gone that isn't true says Jing
          with a serious voice he took you along because he believed in you he
          told you to run away because he had underestimated the enemy if he
          hadn't thought you capable kite wouldn't have let you accompany him no
          matter what you'd said Jing frowned slightly as he still continues
          saying it was his fault that he misjudged the enemy but gone is about
          to say before he is interrupted by Jing I know says Jing you are also
          at fault for being too weak you should feel responsible too gone with
          tears and snot in his face just nods don't make the same mistake advis
          is Jing and you should apologize to kite not me you didn't say clearly
          whether he is dead or alive but either way you should apologize as
          Jing says that he points towards the exit door up the stairs of the
          hall gone just nods at this yeah the conversation between them
          continues like this but Jax just looks at this from the sidelines with
          a strange smile on his face he was extremely amused by the scene in
          front of him Jing is really good at bulling his way out of things
          thanks Jax already seeing through Jing everyone in the room is
          concentrated in this conversation after all this is a gold mine of
          good drama finally as their conversation ended Gan went up the stairs
          but he turned around one last time towards Jing and said Jing can I
          see you later immediately Jing just scratches his cheek with a finger
          and said ah I am a busy man that is crap Jing shouted Jax and after
          that other hecklers immediately started insulting Jing too aren't you
          his father you dead beat dad you loser that is when Jax decides to Fan
          the Flames even more as he shouted again I know all about Greed Island
          you didn't meet with gone even after he cleared it yeah just shut up
          says Jing annoyed by all of the hecklers fine then he points towards
          gone I will be waiting so get going what the hell us htty Father tell
          him something like see you later or love you son says Jax amused and
          trying to add more fire to the other heated up Hunters Jing just turns
          towards Jax pointing at him shut the hell up Jax you are just trying
          to stir up trouble Jax acts angry at this hey htty y father of the
          decade stop accusing me why don't you try being a better father
          instead yeah you brain dead illiterate shtt father you are a loser
          Jing and just like that people started throwing things like cans shoes
          or such things together Jing hole booing him after that whole Fiasco
          Cheeto Yorkshire is chosen as the new chairman of the hunters
          Association Jax used this experience to amuse himself further and the
          next day some shocking news was made by nasab guo the king of the Ken
          Empire as Jax is in his own private hotel room with the TV on he is
          completely naked he just took a shower he looks at the fat man on the
          TV as he announces to the whole world we the Ken Empire declare we
          shall carry on the dreams of humanity in advance our reach to the Dark
          Continent chapter 51 when Jax hears the announcement he has a huge
          smile on his face he just gets up and goes to the drawer he pulls out
          simple black pants and a sleeveless white shirt and simple underwear
          this is contrary to what he usually wears from his suits and all that
          suddenly and slowly A Dangerous Aura comes out of his body but instead
          of exploding out his nen it comes out in a controlled manner it isn't
          sensed by anyone outside of this room this is starting to get quite
          fun says Jacks talking to himself as his Aura completely shakes the
          building that he is in just like an earthquake he he he he Mikasa you
          can come out now suddenly the balcony door opens and Mikasa comes
          inside Jax just summons his floating treasure chest and opens it
          taking something out it is a book as wide as a dictionary the title of
          the book was the Dark Continent by Jax Millers it is a personally
          written book it was written by Jax himself as he used the ruins to
          study the different areas of the Dark Continent he opens the books and
          on a certain page he reads out loud the Dark Continent though
          represented as a new continent to the public It Isn't So at all it
          isn't a continent it's a whole new world our human world is simply in
          the middle of the Lake of the Dark Continent also everything is Giant
          in there even bugs are bigger than the humans in that place also
          dinosaur like creatures litter the place Jax just keeps reading out
          loud for Mikasa so she can understand what this and how the Dark
          Continent as he told her about the five calamities that Humanity
          brought back Mikasa just sigh at this and says that isn't a place that
          humanity is ready to go back to Just Smiles at this and he closes the
          book yep humanity is fed if somehow a mass number of those creatures
          arrive here Mikasa seems thoughtful of this and comes to the
          conclusion even nukes wouldn't be enough we would self-destruct most
          likely Jax nods at this humanity is willing to sacrifice millions of
          Clueless people and have many different suicide attacks to survive
          Mikasa frowns at this but in the end we would be lucky to survive as a
          race hole JAX on the other has a completely confident look on his face
          oh I wouldn't be so sure about that I am sure that billions of people
          will die but in the end only the cream of the top Will Survive true it
          would be only the top science n users leader Etc but it would
          definitely Rush Humanity to get stronger Mikasa seems unsure of this
          but from your information Humanity also came from the Dark Continent
          that means that they ran away because they couldn't handle its harsh
          environment Jax has a surprised look on his face right that is another
          way to look at it I guess but now it is different back then Humanity
          didn't have flying ships neither did they have bombs like the poor
          man's Rose also Humanity evolves better when in war and danger After
          All the Poor Man's Rose didn't develop because there was peace around
          but because the world was at War Mikasa immediately looks at Jax with
          an uncertain look on her eyes Jay Jax don't tell me you plan to bring
          the creatures from the Dark Continent here Jax just laughs when he
          hears Mikasa say that nah I am not that crazy Mikasa releases a sigh
          of relief at this suddenly Jax's face morphs into a malicious smile I
          am crazier I plan to bring Humanity back to the Dark Continent and
          Conquer it haahahaha mikasa's eyes widen he can see the look on her
          teacher's face and the laughter of absolute Joy coming out of him
          humanity is going to rule the world under its feet like it is supposed
          to be says Jax as he interlocks his fingers do you know what makes me
          nervous it's the future of humanity not ruling the whole world world
          and not being an Intergalactic species mikasa's eyes widen as she
          hears her teacher say such things with such certainty and confidence
          as if he already knows that Humanity will achieve this he is
          absolutely mad thinks Mikasa but her feelings on this are already
          decided I see then I will still follow you to the ends of the world
          and keep you safe Jax he smiles at this I know Mikasa but his eyes had
          a certain look on them I see so you will still follow me Mikasa I
          guess you really were a worthy investment thinks Jax as he analyses
          mikasa's reaction he wanted to see if she really has 100% loyalty like
          this two months pass by in the blink of an eye on the first floor
          where the place where the princes and princesses are supposed to
          reside princess Camila she is a beautiful woman with long Fair hair
          worn in an intricate hairstyle with some locks falling on her back
          others were tied up above the nape of her neck and for framing her
          face she has clear eyes and long eyelashes she is wearing a blue dress
          as she waves at the people boarding the ship as she does so she goes
          towards her own quarters which is onad a whole section if the first
          floor of the black whale ship and as she arrives she looks at her
          bodyguards and says don't follow me I am going to my room kill anyone
          who comes inside as she says that she opens the door to her big
          private room and as she does so thud she hears bodies of her
          bodyguards hit the ground the ship hasn't even set sail yet and the
          selection has not started yet but someone is already targeting me
          thinks Camila as she just sigh at this wonder which one of my siblings
          it is that is when the door opens and an unfamiliar voice comes
          through yo chapter 52 Camila just looks at the perpetrator he has
          black hair and brown eyes he also seems to be wearing reading glasses
          and has an easygoing smile on his face his presence is so vague so he
          must be an assassin contemplates Camila as she analyses the man in
          front of her Jax just look surprised as he looks at Camila oh this is
          surprising you don't seem to be afraid of me no more specifically you
          are not afraid of death his observation seems terrifying better be
          careful Camila just looks at the man in front of her we just boarded
          here the party hasn't even started I am not a violent person also
          everyone will die eventually so no need to cry over it jack'ss face
          morphs into a smile and gets inside closing the door behind him H now
          that is a lie but you are still unafraid of death I can also see that
          you aren't really nervous to how is that possible immediately Camila
          gets nervous terrifying he is reading right through me better provoke
          him to kill me or else this man will see through me just shut up and
          kill me already you are boring me you really are not good with women
          says Camila nonchalantly Jax's smile widens even more H so you are
          rushing me to attack me you seem to be really inexperienced with n
          battles anything you say or do can be used against you and by
          observing what you are doing in your calm reaction you most likely
          have a Revenge Type ability but even then you are still too calm after
          all even Revenge Type ability users are careful if I try to kill them
          in one shot they will still try to prevent that but you are different
          so I came to the likely conclusion that your ability is activated by
          death but something doesn't add up you still don't fear death so the
          only logical conclusion is that somehow your revenge ability most
          likely it also kills the one who kills you the more Jax talks the more
          Camila is shocked in the end she becomes terrified of Jax what the [
          __ ] he [ __ ] figured out my ability so fast what a [ __ ] monster I
          didn't even [ __ ] use nen oh judging by your expression and body
          language you just confirmed my assumption said Jax with a mischievous
          smirk on his face Camila immediately goes into Panic at this L listen
          I I can give you anything whatever my siblings are giving to you I
          will double it she knows that if someone as smart as the man in front
          of her were to know of her ability he can definitely kill her for
          example with starvation of even suicide by manipulating her using
          manipulation men though she doesn't know if he is of that category Jax
          just laughs at this haaha I am not here to kill you I am here to
          bargain with you Camila is still nervous at this but her fear calmed
          down and her body turned back to normal I I see well the deal is
          simple really I will be your bodyguard but you can't order me or
          anything like that I will also decide to protect you when it's
          convenient for me I just wanted a place on the luxurious first floor
          say Jax nonchalantly telling her of his real intentions Camila still
          seems unsure of this bit in the end she accepts okay you can do that
          Jax nods at this but after that whole situation is over he immediately
          loses interest in Camila and starts going around the room looking for
          anything interesting due to this being a Prince's room it is big and
          has multiple living quarters even a room for her personal staff Jax
          just goes around checking everything and trying some of the food on
          the fridge he then finally sees something that interests him it's a
          big flat screen TV and takes the remote turning it on going through
          some channels Camila is bewildered by Jax's actions this is not how a
          normal person acts at all what if she decides to betray him or kill
          him in his sleep this sucks there are no interesting channels there
          are only some basic news channels damn seems like my trip to the Dark
          Continent will be as boring as expected says Jax as he sits down on
          the couch and puts his feet on the table Camila just sigh at seeing
          Jax acting lazy like this where did the terrifying person from before
          go now he seems more like a lazy shut in and right at that moment Jax
          yawns and looks towards Camila do you have any games here or did you
          only take your dresses and make up for the Dark Continent she doesn't
          know how to answer this she wants to yell and swear at him but she
          remembers the terrifying image and helplessness she felt just one
          minute ago W what is going on why am I automatically underestimating
          him thanks Camila as she can't help but be even more scared of Jacks
          in just 1 minute after making her think he will kill her in the next
          he made her let her guard down in front of him I better let this go
          for now I will contemplate it after the departing ceremony Camila
          looks at Jax and finally gains courage to ask him can you wake up my
          bodyguards that you knocked out while she was saying that Jax was just
          looking at the closed fridge with a complicated look on his eyes
          Camila awaits his answer but when she sees that he didn't hear her she
          gets a little annoyed on the inside but she doesn't display it at all
          um excuse me mister Jax finally comes out of his trace and looks at
          Camila oh sorry I was distracted anyway can you please open that
          fridge for me I it feels like a lot of effort to get up from the couch
          Camila frowns at Jax treating her like a servant but she still listens
          to him and as she opens the fridge Jax just points his finger at the
          fridge bunge gum pink Aura is created at the tip of his finger and it
          goes to the fridge grabbing different drinks one by one so this is his
          ability he must be a transmuter thinks Camila as she looks at Jax's
          nen uh most of them are alcoholic drinks I don't drink alcohol this
          sucks Jax looks down in sadness my disappointment is immeasurable and
          my day is ruined Camila takes this moment to ask Jax again I know of
          different types of fruit drink in the servants room I can go and get
          them for you if you awake my unconscious bodyguards Jax just lazily
          nods at this Yan sure sure just get me some peach or orange juice they
          are my favorite what are you a kid or something Camila can't help but
          criticize Jacks in her head she goes and gets the drinks the room is
          inside this bit apartment that each of the princes have their own as
          she comes back she sees something that extremely annoys her Jacks is
          just there sleeping on the couch snore he he is so annoying screams
          Camila inside her head she had been away for only a couple of seconds
          but he was already asleep but as she goes to get close to Jack she can
          hear the door to her room open she immediately looks at it suspecting
          it to be an enemy but it is actually her knocked out bodyguards she
          feels an immense amount of shock at this W what I was away for only a
          split second how is this possible he went outside and awoke them all
          in a split second I heard nothing at all there were no signs of it Jax
          finally lazily opens his eyes oh thank you anyway I don't think you
          will be safe with this group so I will make something able to protect
          you I am your kind of bodyguard slowly a calm and plentiful Aura
          manifests around Jack's as a blob of it separates from him and it
          slowly transforms into a white fur muscular gorilla Jack Smiles at
          this and says well you can't EX exactly take a gorilla to a part so I
          better fix that he then points towards one of the bodyguards hey you
          throw me that towel by the door The Bodyguard does so and Jax catches
          it and throws it back towards the white gorilla slowly the towel
          surrounds the gorilla made out of nen the towel wraps itself around
          the gorilla slowly making it look like a giant muscular human man well
          you can go to the party now see you later says Jax as he falls asleep
          snore chapter 53 Jack's POV I just look at Camila as she gets ready
          for the party I know quite a lot about her from the Manga she is the
          second child of the current Emperor or the second Prince the Royal
          children of th3 Ken Empire are all called a prince no matter their
          gender Camila is the second Prince I must say though weak from my
          perspective her inability is really the only interesting thing about
          the succession War I only went to bother her because I want to see if
          I can copy it my talent is at level 13 now I know how good I am at nen
          I can copy even some pretty complicated abilities with two or less
          harsh limitations sadly I still can't copy something like kap's chain
          or K's Bandit secret they are too complicated and have too many
          restrictions for me to create plus cwlo being a specialist makes it
          even harder as she goes outside together with white goru who now looks
          like a muscular bald human with a suit after using on him I know what
          will likely happen Camila will meet her father and will ask what
          survival means when choosing the next king obviously I already know
          what it means the competition is obviously a death match amongst the
          royya children but killing a prince is still a serious crime so they
          can't do it in the open they must be careful about it and do it in
          secret or let someone else take the blame though a barbaric method in
          a way it also allows to choose the one most Worthy of the position
          well in my opinion someone inheriting any leadership positions just be
          being born into it is absolute sht but I guess a good old Slaughter
          game is good enough to choose a mediocre leader who won't destroy the
          country just by existing still though this succession will be a little
          boring for me I can easily kill everyone in this ship under an hour or
          probably faster if I went all out meaning that I can kill 200 people
          in an hour honestly even if they were men users I wouldn't have any
          more difficulty killing them than I do a normal human after all a
          strong bug or a weak bug I still just stomp on them still though I
          know that Camila's n Beast will have a manipulation ability which is
          dangerous even to someone around my strength if all of the conditions
          are completed but not really that dangerous to me manipulation
          abilities work on the principle of early bird gets the worm meaning
          someone already under control can't be controlled by someone else I am
          already under the manipulation of my own men so I can't be controlled
          by others yawn this is my own condition in a way it acts like a
          restriction but in my eyes it's a boon anyway soon the N Beasts of the
          royal children will awaken I will need to be careful about something
          like that I know in raw power I am unmatched in the human world with
          only nanica coming close to me or maybe the calamities but overall I
          am stronger than them in a contest of raw power with no conditions to
          it because the five calamities are mostly considered dangerous due to
          their dangerous abilities Against Humanity as a whole after a while
          Camila finally comes back with her bodyguards and my monkey men Beast
          I was just playing some RPG games and reading some Comics these things
          can give some good look into the imagination and possibilities that I
          might be able to develop with nen after all my ability literally works
          like an RPG well in reality it's nothing like it the whole RPG feel of
          it are just the conditions needed for me to get the EXP and use it
          though I did use my love for games to develop this ability it is
          actually more like a ritual used to make me stronger I just dis spel
          on white goru turning him back to the white fur gorilla that he is I
          just look at the guardian Spirit Beast that has manifested itself
          between Camila who seems to have an annoyed look on her face it seems
          like it's not directed towards me that is as expected I did put a
          needle on her head after all my manipulation is a little more subtle
          than the usual it simply creates a better opinion of myself on the
          victim slowly turning them into an ally anyway I see that her guardian
          beast is the same form as in the manga it has a cylindrical shape in
          which the upper part is comprised of several tentacles with sunken
          tips that protrude outwards as if they were the branches of a tree the
          lower part of its body extends like a great mantle and ends up forming
          a kind of skirt Benjamin is as annoying as as always he should just
          die for my sake that stupid brother of mine says Camila in a trace of
          anger but she stops as I break her out of her Trace as I say I see so
          you have developed an N Beast it must be the parasitic type since it
          doesn't seem to be formed by your nen also you can't see it and since
          I can sense a couple presences like it it must mean that it somehow
          has to do with the Royal competition though I say all of that as if I
          just understood it I actually got it from the mang and no one is that
          good at coming up with sht but they don't know that as Camila and some
          of her bodyguards stop and look at me with shocked looks on their
          faces Camila releases a sigh to calm herself down from her anger and
          looks at me with a smile on her face if you were really my bodyguard I
          would have this succession War as good as one as she says that I see
          that her n Beast reacts in some way H is she invoking one of her
          conditions in getting control over me that is highly possible I just
          smile at this anyway princess I would be careful if I was you you
          can't really hide your intentions too well I already told you as an
          nuser you will need to be careful about stuff like this by just saying
          that you already gave out that your guardian beast has its own
          category and is a manipulator I can see Camila's face cringe for a
          split second I mean I understand where she is coming from I am
          literally just nitpicking at everything she does and getting Vital
          Information from it well I am a very good detective with Talent equal
          to one in a billion so I can easily read her thought-provoking and
          what she is thinking just by minuscule hits given away by her body
          language that is the time when then Beasts of the other Royal children
          are fully awakened and start moving around the rooms and they even
          entered ours they range from different forms one looks like a giant
          mouse one looks like a dragon and there are even some oneeyed small
          creatures the other people in the room except the princess who can't
          see them are on guard the princess notices the others reactions and
          immediately asks one of the bodyguards what is going on and he replies
          men beasts are all around us this has become dangerous princess cila I
          just smirk at this let's see how dangerous it really is Boom my men
          violently explodes out of my body and it immediately encompasses I
          look at the beasts and my malicious aren turns my Ora completely dark
          I just look at the beasts and tell them to scram chapter 54 General
          poov as Jax's malicious men explodes out of him the guardian beasts
          all stop though they are beasts they too have instincts as they freeze
          and place an absolute fear of the monster in front of them Jax's eyes
          are shadowed in darkness as he says get out or I will devour you
          immediately the guardian men beat beasts Scamper away Camila and her
          bodyguards are all shaking at what they felt something that should be
          impossible to exist it is said that men battles aren't decided on Raw
          men alone but this this monster is in a category of its own they
          sensed how he manipulated his men to just stay inside the room and not
          affect anyone outside of it they are unsure of what is scarer him
          having that amount of aura or him being able to control it in such a
          way that would be impossible even for the most talented person JAX on
          the other hand turns towards Camila again and smiles Camila be a deer
          and make this war interesting won't you Camila is immediately shocked
          out of her fear she looks at Jax even though he used his Aura to
          intimidate the guardian beasts she still feels like some of her
          servants are almost mentally broken down for Jacks just using his Aura
          why do I feel like this thinks Camila as she feels an almost
          instinctual desire for Jax is this what they mean when they say that
          people just like animals want to breed with the strong even with how
          far we have come with Evolution we humans are just animals who console
          ourselves with our intelligence though she didn't notice it Camila was
          already getting affected by Jax's needle she was having positive
          thoughts of him when instead she should be terrified also due to her
          close proximity and even a sliver of true admiration she feels for Jax
          has made her especially susceptible to the needle effects it is 4
          hours later that Camila was eating dinner with her mother who has a
          gentle look on her face contrary to her daughter the meal is quiet
          until Camila breaks the Silence by saying mother I hope that you are
          enjoying the meal yes cila it is quite nice answers Camila's mother
          dazle so anyway mother I have a man that I want to charm if I do so I
          am 100% sure that I will have the succession war in my pocket any
          anyway you seduced a king from his first wife tell me your story says
          Camila for the first time in her life asking her mother to teach her
          something her mother seems surprised at this at first but she quickly
          settles down by saying I am afraid that you Camila are better than me
          at this since even I don't have experience with this stuff your father
          simply took me in due to my beautiful looks Camila frowns at this you
          are as useless as ever mother but you are right I am aware that I am
          better than you at this I am also more beautiful so my chances are
          definitely higher while they were talking like this and eating the
          meal Jax was sitting on the couch of the living room and playing some
          games having already connected a gameplay station on he is playing
          some type of sci-fi RPG game as he looks completely unconcerned as he
          is also listening to the conversation between Camila and her mother he
          already heard how Camila plans to get rid of the first Prince Benjamin
          and she also plans to use her mother to get close to her brother both
          of whom have the same mother and then she will plan an assassination
          on Hackenberg those two are the most rival candidates in her opinion
          JAX on the other hand has a whole other person whom he considers the
          most dangerous of them all serit the psycho who will get the ability
          to look 10 seconds into the future if he is in a state of zetsu
          meaning unable to use nen at all obviously Jax doesn't feel nervous at
          all against anyone of the princes while he doesn't feel nervous
          against anyone in this ship but that is beyond the point because Jax
          is still cautious in case someone with a dangerous ability appears Jax
          also looks at a small air vent of the room there is an owl-like
          creature looking at them so we are already being spied on and as
          expected of Camila she is inexperienced and got the illusion that just
          because she told the bodyguards to go away in case of a spy there are
          still other measures in place that can be used to spy on her honestly
          if she wasn't a royal family member she would most likely be just
          another arrogant and dumb blonde bimbo contemplates Jack thinking that
          if it wasn't for her ability and trying to copy some interesting
          abilities of the N users on the first and second floor he wouldn't
          even be here well maybe he would be here he would rather travel in
          luxury if he has the option to do so Jack's POV as her mother goes
          away and it is late into the night Camila just sits on the couch next
          to me while I am playing late night games so it seems like you are
          trying to seduce me I say to her with a concentrated look in the game
          in front of me I am at level 73 if I die light now I will lose one
          level it will be a pain in the ass to get it back tell me what I need
          to do to get your help immediately little Camila didn't even wait for
          me as she asked something like this damn can't she just go and bother
          someone else I mean sure I wouldn't mind spending a night with her but
          she seems kind of annoying and will most likely ask me something after
          the deed is done so I decide to tell her something that can be
          interpreted in many ways I just smile and say it's simple to get my
          support you just have to show me your guts Camila immediately nods at
          this I understand and she gets up going to sleep to her own room I
          decide to give her one last warning before she does so though I
          wouldn't be so keen on sleeping without a bodyguard around I noticed
          something else about your ability she stops walking away turns around
          and looks at me my face is neutral this time you need to also be in a
          state of zetsu when you are killed don't you I asked her already
          knowing the answer this is actually something that I caught on
          recently in the manga it wasn't even mentioned but I guess for such an
          ability to exist it truly does need more than one restriction like
          only death to fuel a resurrection isn't enough General POV the next
          day the death of one of the royal children is announced Camila doesn't
          seem bothered At All by that she just picks up a gun and looks towards
          Jax who is still playing his games I will show you my guts today Jax
          looks up from his games and looks at Camila with a smile on his face I
          will be waiting then but do be careful not to make any stupid
          decisions sometime later in front the first prince Benjamin's room
          there is a receptionist like Personnel who also acts like a bodyguard
          he hears footsteps coming towards him that is when he turns towards
          the hallway and sees Camila with a cold look on her face and a gun on
          her hand still he diced to act decently by saying princess Camila if
          there is something I can take care of it for you Camila has a cold
          look on her eyes as she looks at the man in front of her I am
          currently heading to kill the first prince Benjamin you either assist
          me or you die choose whichever alternative you prefer for I am kind to
          allow that am I not chapter 55 Camila has a cold look on her eyes as
          she looks at the man in front of her I am currently heading to kill
          the first prince Benjamin you either assist me or you die choose
          whichever alternative you prefer for I am kind to allow that am I not
          the guard frowns at this and puts his hand behind his back to get his
          gun lady Camila this is not exactly my idea of a joke even though he
          said that he can see that she means what she is saying so he points
          his gun at Camila and says second Prince Camila I am restraining you
          for conspiring to assassinate first prince Benjamin I have recorded
          our conversation if you take one step closer I will shoot Camila has a
          calm look on her face is that so asks Camila totally calm at what the
          guard just says then shoot and then she starts walking forward the
          guard is shocked at this your highness please stop where you are I
          don't want to shoot you while he is saying that he actually has
          another worry on the inside damn it this btch is she a counter type
          the fact that she is concealing her Aura completely proves with zetsu
          proves that she is an nuser that puts her defenses at zero which puts
          her at maximum risk so she plans to give her counter hatsu the maximum
          as much power as possible and due to using zetsu her guardian beast
          which feeds off her Aura isn't showing itself either she seems
          completely confident in her abilities at best I kill her at worst I
          will still find out what her power is decides the guard as he prepares
          himself to shoot forgive me pow pow pow he shoots three times two
          hitting Camila in the chest and one in the middle of her forehead her
          eyes go dull as she falls on the ground immediately the guard looks a
          little surprised at this is she dead no I better not let my guard down
          and complete the requirements to my ability he is about to get close
          to Camila's corpse but that is when he feels something strange and a
          weird presence behind him he turns around and sees a huge catling
          Beast that appeared behind the hum suddenly the cat moves her hands
          and starts squishing ing the guard into its paws and extracting his
          life force obliterating his body in the process the life energy is
          then transferred to the tip of the N BEAST's tail which turns white
          and begins to Glow the catlike construct then pours the life Essence
          into Camila's mouth healing her injuries completely and resurrecting
          her she opens her eyes and looks around but she sees only her nin
          Beast by her side I have no need for a guardian beast because I have
          her thanks Camila as she looks at her own n Beast she smiles at this
          and starts going towards her brother's room but out of the hallway two
          other people come Camila immediately recognizes them as Benjamin's
          guards they both pull out guns and warn Camila do not come any closer
          princess or we will shoot Camila just pulls her own gun and pow pow
          shoots two of the guards on the head one of them dies immediately
          while the other only has a bruise on his skull as Aura float out of
          his body signifying that he is an nuser the guard is about to attack
          but that is when he hears the sound of Prince Benjamin come through
          his earpiece as he says don't shoot let Camila through the guard is
          angry but he complies to Benjamin's orders pow but that is when
          another shot rings out hitting the guard in the head again making him
          angry but he still only groans out yes sir confirming that he will
          allow Camila through what no one noticed was a small robotic eye
          looking at the things happening in front of here this is one of Jax's
          abilities called cheater eye it allows him to spy on someone and put
          it into a video recording or watch it live which is what JX is
          currently doing he was all along observing Camila's ability and how it
          worked this ability relies on postmortem men to boost its power
          rendering Camila virtually imp possible to kill However the fact that
          death is its activation condition prevents her from negating damage
          she suffers without dying and leaves Camila powerless should the
          opponent not attack her directly analyses Jacks wondering if there are
          any extra conditions or something like that to the ability after that
          he sees that Camila goes in and argues with her brother and tries to
          make his guard shoot her Jack says POV she sure is entertaining at
          least I see that one of the s goes to restrain her that is when Camila
          looks at the guard right in the eyes and says you and your family and
          your relatives I will torture you all in ways that you can't even
          fathom and finally when I am good and done you will beg me for your
          life and finally I will Slaughter you too the guard just looks at
          Camila and calmly answers to her family don't got one my only family
          is first prince Benjamin Madam first class criminal and just like that
          I see Camila get put into a jail cell H that was interesting anyway
          let's see now Ian my Ora immediately spreads all over the ship in a
          circular manner allowing me to sense everything inside it boom the
          whole ship starts shaking I am sure that everyone can sense my men and
          I cannot sense every single movement happening inside the ship slowly
          out of my men a giant white cat appears behind me second life now fat
          General POV Jax immediately started moving his speed unimaginable
          comparable to the speed of light that is all he needed as he went into
          the different Prince's room like Prince Benjamin no one could even
          react as he sticks hundreds of needles in his brain the same thing
          happened with the King and all of the other Cen Empire royal family
          every one of them was sticked with an unbelievable number of them gone
          was the subtle manipulation that slowly works now he just straight out
          took control of all of the royal family in one shot sering nit was
          immediately killed Jax used a to create a weaker copy of himself and
          to completely make his outer appearance appear like terich I no longer
          have Canon knowledge so I need to manipulate these unstable factors to
          my will thanks Jax as he completed all of this in exactly 2 seconds
          and just like that time in the boat passes the now unimportant
          succession War goes on Jax having already figured out the reason why
          the war was being held founded in a way kind of funny but the Ken
          Empire had been left behind as the hunters Advance into Dark Continent
          but before they even arrived the giant ship called black whale boom
          exploded as a giant Serpentine like creature came below it killing
          hundreds of hunters but that was not all as panus swarmed towards the
          shattered ship looking for their prey JAX on the other hand was flying
          up above looking at the chaos below him he also sees me Kasa who had
          been in the lower decks she seems to have survived this attack she is
          just jumping through the wreckages of the ship trying to keep herself
          from getting devoured so this is the Dark Continent H that was
          dangerous even I would have died if those giant panas got their teeth
          on me but Jax has a smile on his face all along as he thinks of this I
          guess this is it then here I come Dark Continent decides Jax as he has
          a tablet on his hand his Aura slowly taking the form of giant needles
          slowly going towards the fish and skewering them and then Jax uses his
          Extreme Speed to go and turn the giant fish into exp he looks at his
          tablet clicks on stats and sees Jax Miller age 30 Talent LVL 13025 600
          exp exp 2829 St Str LVL 10 53200 EX P AG LVL 11064 exp and LVL 11156
          400 exp n amount LVL 111 16,400 exp his face morphs into a giant smile
          I just got 500 exp from only one kill I will get so strong now
          immediately out of his massive Aura hundreds of giant needles are
          created starting the slot da of the giant creatures of the Dark
          Continent chapter 56 epilog after Conquering the Dark Continent I
          reached a power unimaginable before now even light can't keep up with
          my speed anymore Humanity has conquered the dark continent and is
          already planning for Intergalactic travel with the resources of the
          Dark Continent everything is in place the only resource I didn't allow
          Humanity to have was the Nitro rice the thing that allows someone to
          live longer I took that all for myself and growed it on my own
          personal game Dimension anyway I figured something out in the Dark
          Continent there were many species even ones who had space manipulation
          abilities anyway with my high talent I was able to copy a bunch of
          them and I have created a new move so I am currently on the ground and
          I look at the sky I crouch down and the muscles in my leg triple in
          size boom I make a powerful leap and jump into space in less than a
          second I am up there my body is coated by nen so space doesn't really
          hurt it I mean even my natural body wouldn't be hurt my natural
          endurance is crazy anyway I look down and see the many giant trees
          that were sprouting all over the Dark Continent immediately I
          concentrate again and in the space in front of me a portal opens I
          used a dozen space related hatsu to make this possible though since
          technically they were all recreated by me I also put the conditions
          that I can only use them outside of the planet back then I couldn't
          just jump into space so that strengthened my men by quite a lot anyway
          I am not 100% sure where this portal will take me I just know that it
          will take me away from this place where I can't really grow any
          stronger also I used the cookie an N Beast which makes one cookie
          every day that raises my luck so with that I just walk through the
          portal and when I come out from the other side I am in a medieval city
          what did I just return back to Earth but the conditions were that I
          would be randomly transported in a new and possibly dangerous World it
          seems like I was lucky and got transported in a nice world so that
          would mean that I am in a new world but I immediately notice something
          strange everything is too quiet not only there are no people around
          here but there is literally no sound b birds no stone falling to the
          ground and no wind at all I have been to similar places and have
          enountered similar abilities on the Dark Continent but this is all too
          weird I use Ian and immediately it spreads out hundreds of kilometers
          it is at the same as the speed of light as it spread so it doesn't
          even take a millisecond to cover the whole city this really is just a
          City floating into nothingness but I did sense one person though and
          he is right above me I look up and see a dark-haired man with
          similarly dark eyes he seems to be reading a manga one piece while he
          is levitating and floating anyway I just call out to him as a friendly
          smile appears on my face yo can you tell me where I am the person
          looks at me with a side glance and says oh so you made it then
          honestly thought that you would fail you were like the first guy I
          decided to reincarnate so I was never quite sure about you you should
          be grateful that you weren't born a woman or a cat I was honestly in
          no control over that I just threw you in a densely populated area and
          hoped that you weren't reborn as a rat I just look at him I don't know
          how to feel about this I don't even know if he is telling the truth
          this could be all a lie or something like that I am half tempted to
          immediately attack him right now but it would be dangerous or would it
          I immediately use my right hand and grasp my left arm and I pull
          squelch with a little difficulty I ripped off my left arm completely
          and blood flies everywhere with this being a fatal injury I can now
          activate my ability flash immediately I see a future me do the action
          and speak some words so this means that me fighting him wouldn't be
          good by my perfect plan showing this it means that I have no chance of
          winning in a fight against him I wonder if I would be able to escape
          though but sadly perfect plan won't show that to me I have a few other
          future predicting abilities but that would require a lot of conditions
          to activate also it would be useless the perfect action has already
          been shown my arm is also put back in place and healed I just asked
          the man up there who are you and where are we as soon as I ask so he
          looks away from his manga and looks at me again this time I can
          clearly read the amusement on his eyes well my name is Yumi says the
          man I like staks and other things I am also alternate version of you
          also we are currently in a place that I myself made it is called The
          Citadel I plan to have this place full of different versions of me but
          you are the first one to arrive here so welcome when he says that my
          eyes immediately widened so I was reincarnated by an alternate version
          of myself I guess I will think about that later I can't Panic here so
          in the end I decide to say to him I see then yumy my name is Jax and I
          would like to make an offer to you he looks at me with a questioning
          look on his eyes and he mentions me to continue what I want is for a
          way to grow stronger my perfect plan is working towards the best
          outcome for that too so as I see what my future self does I am a
          little surprised I really love this ability so as I see the peach of
          my future self I offer to him well I bet that a lot of the alternate
          selves that you sent die either because they are weak or something
          like that Yumi looks at me and a smile appears on his face do go on I
          swallow a little just like my future self did and in the end I
          continue well I can create a gamer likee systems like the anime system
          or such though they won't be too powerful and WTF My Future Self said
          that anyway I continue saying and also I will get 70% of the EXP that
          they get I see that yumi's smile hasn't changed at all I know that
          this will allow me to grow tremendously and I will use other versions
          of myself as leaks that will help me keep growing stronger
          indefinitely why my future said that to yumy I don't know don't Tell
          Me Maybe yumy has some mind reading ability and can tell something
          like that so me being honest was the best move yummi in the end after
          thinking for a split second he just says okay then I accept your deal
          I can hardly stop the smile from appearing on my face but he continues
          by saying but you must convince them to accept the system though I
          will allow you for the next soul that I reincarnate you can put a
          system in him don't give him anything too powerful either so anyway do
          we have a deal as Yumi asks that he extends his hand towards me in a
          handshake I smile and clasp it I look at him straight in the eyes as I
          say yes yes I accept well then it seems like this is the new start of
          a wonderful partnership the end
