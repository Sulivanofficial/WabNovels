        <h2>Capítulo 1: -</h2>
        <p>
          Dying is a new feeling of anger for me I was about to go to college
          for engineering with a scholarship I had it all planned out for
          college I was going to make some connections there knowing some people
          getting the best grades and using those people that I made connections
          with to get a good job and then I will plan to go higher and higher
          until I touched the sky I had plans to get rich quick I even had a
          family the family that gave up a lot for me they needed me and I just
          had to go and die damn it damn it damn it then I feel something weird
          and look around the void and I turn around and see an eye as gigantic
          as a mountain I I am not going to lie I am scared I just kept walking
          backward away from it as fast and as stealthily as I can then as I am
          doing so I keep looking at The Darkness thing with just an eye and I
          see a gigantic mouth open I can't even see its end jet rows and rows
          of sharp teeth a lot of tongues come out of the mouth and towards me
          this is terrifying as I think this I immediately turn around and run
          in darkness or whatever I don't even look at what I am stepping in I
          keep running and running and running I don't know how long I have been
          running but I see a circle made of light about my size in front of me
          so I directly jump into it and then I lose consciousness the next time
          I wake up I see a bright light in front of my face and hear someone or
          something say it's a boy M Miller I suddenly feel someone grabbing me
          my baby my baby boy ah I get it now after I hear that I immediately
          start crying as I have assessed the situation I hear someone with a
          hard manly voice say my son my son are you okay honey then the voice I
          hear the womanly voice from before talking in an ushered tone answer
          yes just stop screaming you are making the baby cry just like this 6
          months pass after being here for such a Time life is really boring I
          was born in do Harbor in 1969 I don't know where I am but I am in the
          past Sue that means a lot of money making opportunities waiting for me
          I am about to overuse my future knowledge as much as I can by the way
          my name is Jax Miller and my parents names are Jerry Miller 41 years
          old black hair and eyes and good looking man that works in a loan bank
          Beth Miller 28 years old brown hair and brown eyes with a pretty face
          yeah I know quite the age difference there and there is me I seem like
          I am going to be good-looking with black hair and brown eyes with a
          baby face I don't know to me babies just look almost all the same
          finally I reached the age of one-year-old and okay okay Red Alert I
          just heard father say something bizarre he was talking to me about
          hunters at first I didn't think anything special but he said that when
          he was younger he wanted to be a hunter or whatever I was only half
          listening but when I asked about specifically why he wanted to be a
          hunter when he earns more money and easier as a lone man I asked him
          in gibberish baby talk obviously but then he started explaining Hunter
          adventures and stories types of them like Blacklist Hunters Gourmet
          Hunters Etc I almost went full panic mode but I pushed it at the back
          of my mind and forced myself to calm down then as soon as night time
          came I went into bed and I started practicing meditation well then an
          extreme change of plans must come about I must meditate to start my
          training now I am in the world of Hunter x Hunter then as I reached 2
          years old I already started preparing for the future the main thing I
          need is access to N I keep meditating but I still haven't awakened it
          yet I am kind of disappointed that I don't have the kind of talent the
          MC's do but I still keep trying not giving up after all I have
          patience because I am born way before the main characters I now
          started to run around do Harbor to get to know things around but
          mainly for me to exercise my body of course I don't go into Shady easy
          to get kidnapped alleys and areas I always run during daylight and
          when there is at least a dozen people around finally as I am at the
          age of three I have had some success in nen yes I did it I got my nen
          I feel the warm mucus feeling around me then I am even able to
          naturally close my nodes from leaking any Aura until I can cover
          myself in it and not let any go away as another year passes I notice
          something strange it seems like I have nowhere near the talent of Gan
          and kilowa I still need to keep training my 10 are the hard work I
          have to put through just because I don't have the talent well then
          anyway I now have control over 10 and I still keep training my body I
          now even go and help the people around carrying their stuff and keep
          acting like a kid I am thinking after getting a bit stronger I will
          run away from home and go train somewhere I won't really miss my new
          parents I was never really connect with them after all I did possess
          their baby I mean if I didn't do so then how was I able to use nen
          with my average soul from my past life and if they knew they would
          definitely not react nicely but I don't blame them for it either and
          I'm even a little grateful to them for creating my new body even so
          the only people I will ever truly love are my family in my last world
          but at least they are safe in that one I also learned how to read and
          started convincing my father to buy me medical books I gave him a
          reason because I want to become a doctor to save people he reluctantly
          did so at the age of five I am finally able to train other basic nin
          techniques I have now started training zetsu to suppress my aura to
          hide from other nin users I still train my body now that I am ready to
          find out my category of nen I didn't try it sooner because it would
          have been useless to me with my talent it would have only got me
          distracted I am in my room and ready to do so I put down a glass of
          water with a leaf on top and I then run some in through it that is
          when chapter 2 The Leaf started rotating a little ah I see so I am a
          manipulator well that is quite good it's not that bad of an N category
          because every one of them has their uniqueness and strengths ulator
          what can I do with that whom I have a basic idea on my hatsu but it
          would take my lifespan to get it completed because of my lack of
          Talent OR AA size anyway instead of wasting my lifespan I will just
          try to train to my maximum capacity and that will be when I create my
          hatsu special ability it wouldn't take much of my lifespan or none at
          all I will wait until I am 20 then I will create my hatsu I will have
          plenty of power and then amount by then I hope plus with 10 slowing
          down aging but not slowing down growth I think I will be okay then but
          I really don't want to waste lifespan on this ability after all I am
          not like a selfless shown and character that will sacrifice things
          like this but the time until I create my ability will help me think of
          some more things to add to it or maybe put some conditions on it to
          make it easier to create and stronger as I grow at the age of six I
          notice that my body is getting stronger I have started going to the
          wild to train after I learned Reen to enhance my physical ability well
          not really the wild just the forests outside the city I am still
          studying the basics of nen I have also started studying some simple
          medical books after all I am going to become a doctor in this world
          and then take the hunter exam I have some big plans after my hunter
          exam as another year flows by I still am just training the basic n
          techniques and my body I am going to school now I usually just train
          zetsu in school and other techniques at other times at least this time
          school is easy I also made a lot of friends that do things for me
          mostly a smart student I make him do my homework after all I already
          know these things that we are learning so it's just a waste of time I
          keep studying medicines and training my body in the wild after all
          there are a lot of ways to be strong in this world even without nen
          there exist people like a snake charmer or even someone who knows
          assassination techniques n doesn't necessarily diminish this
          uniqueness it actually makes it even more complicated also I have been
          reading some animal books to learn about some animals in this world
          then that gave me an idea I have started killing some wild animals
          without my parents knowing and selling them in the harbor to buyers of
          course I was disguised in a cloak I earned a lot of money like this
          about 100 Jenny which is around 100 of course this was not won by just
          selling animals earnestly it was by selling RAR looking animals which
          were not rare to stupid buyers and always coming only once a month at
          different intervals to sell people fake animals and come the other
          times in another disguise to sell normal animals that I catch in a day
          at the age of eight I have stopped selling fake animals because
          someone might come after me so this year I won only 40 Jenny I have
          also spent 10 00 buying four medical books I needed I have also been
          telling my mother that I have been sleeping in one of my friend's
          houses and having a sleepover when in reality I am sleeping in the
          forest with a rope on a branch tied to a rock on one side and in the
          other is me holding it with my hand while sleeping this is an exercise
          from the anime so I am trying to learn it well I learned that pretty
          fast so I didn't have to tell my parents new excuses why I am not
          sleeping at home I skipped some grades also when I told my parents
          school is too easy boring and not a challenge and I want to skip it I
          have been training my body a lot my strength especially by Rolling a
          lot of rocks that are up to my knee I would try for more but I really
          don't want to hurt my young body yet I even started learning gyo which
          is putting men towards my eyes to see n better and see things hidden
          with i in it was quite hard learning and keeping my in concentrated on
          my eyes but hey at least I can now use it I still keep training the
          basics a damn it why don't I have talent like Gan or kilua I would
          have already been strong if I had that by the way I need to think of a
          way to make more money now that I have gyo there could be a way to
          earn money age 9 years old I still keep practicing the basic n
          abilities and goo which I can now use sparingly M my talent is sht
          it's not even funny at how average it is if I was born in the same
          generation as the MC's I would just go to a quiet place far from the
          conflict and stay in isolation until I get my n mastered which by then
          I wouldn't even know what happened I now keep pushing Boulders as big
          as my childish body I keep going towards the market to find anything
          good but all I find is trash nothing with nen in it I even quit
          hunting it's just a waste of time for way to little amount of money at
          the age of 10 my body has gotten more robust and muscular even when I
          am so young now they I am doing pull-ups with rope tied to my feet
          with a small Boulder tied on the other side I do push-ups with
          Boulders half as big as me on my back I still train the basics and go
          a lot you know this is getting kind of annoying when I remember how
          the MC got it so easily gyo is getting better I am now able to keep it
          up kind of stable for about 1 minute did I already complain today
          about my super average talent I keep studying medicine and I skipped a
          bunch of grades and went directly to high school people around town
          know me as a helpful and genius young man and my parents are really
          proud of me I don't really care about any of that I just want to train
          my Men chapter 3 as I become 15 years old I noticed that I have gotten
          quite stronger since last time normal people can no longer be compared
          to me I have trained my body quite harshly my n amount is now larger
          than before I haven't seen any Hunters around to compare it to in the
          next years to come I am going to keep a lookout for them I am now in
          University studying medicine away from my hometown I am known quite a
          bit in this field and am known by some important people even though I
          keep training men I have started to feel the limit of my talent it's
          getting harder and harder to get stronger I would need years and years
          to progress even a bit I look at my hands and I make them into a fist
          I just need to wait five more years to get everything in order for me
          to make my hatsu I have everything about my ability figured out but I
          need to be a little stronger to not use lifespan and have less
          conditions on it just like this 3 years pass and I am 18 years old now
          I still study in this University after all medical knowledge has
          become more of a side project I have been studying and trying to
          figure the best method on how to train my body as I was currently
          reading on the library after I finished some body training I was tired
          so I decided to rest here and read while doing so I then hear a
          professor that teaches about diseases and viruses talking with someone
          else and walking towards me I then give a side glance towards him and
          then my eyes widen immediately he is not even in my radar anymore what
          I am concentrated on is the person next to him she is a bespectacled
          woman of average height with seafoam green hair haircut at medium
          length she wears a headdress that has a pair of doglike ears a
          conservative knee length white dress and a white caplet with a cross
          at the front of the neck her upper jaw and nose also look like those
          of a dog she is a younger Cheeto yure the woman who will become the
          future chairman of the hunter Association then as they are walking
          towards me the teacher points at me and says in a proud voice he is
          our brightest student his name is Jax Miller he has been here since he
          was 15 he is truly amazing he is smart and a hard worker then they are
          in front of my table I look towards them then the teacher Smiles
          towards me and says Jax this is a disease Hunter and a famous one at
          that her name is cheel Yorkshire I look at her with a neutral face
          trying to keep my thoughts unreadable also it wouldn't be smart to lie
          or act in front of her because she will definitely be able to tell
          even though she is younger now she was able to tell when one of the
          most scheming people in Hunter x Hunter is not telling the truth she
          just looks at me she smiles a little and she says hey there my name is
          Cheeto Yorkshire have you ever thought of taking the hunter exam I can
          see that you are special I just look towards her and am about to say
          something but I am interrupted by the teacher who in a panicked voice
          says no no Miss Yorkshire Jax is a good student and is going to likely
          be a miraculous doctor but I have heard that the hunter exam is
          physically taxing and I don't think that he is ready or suited for it
          she just looks at him and says in a mysterious tone I think that he is
          stronger than you give him credit for professor she is right I still
          keep training myself extensively every day then she completely ignores
          my professor as she keeps staring at me intensely that is when I
          decide to say to her in a normal voice sa yes I have thought about it
          but I am not ready yet I am first thinking of finishing medical school
          getting some medical experience then I will become a hunter she just
          looks at me turns around and starts walking away while but not before
          she says okay then I will be waiting for you to become a hunter notify
          me when you do become one I could teach you more about your uniqueness
          I can immediately guess what she is thinking she probably thought I
          was an N genius they are those that use nen unconsciously she probably
          didn't take me as her student and teach me nin immediately because she
          probably wants to follow the rules to keep nin hidden she probably
          also thinks that nen might distract me from my medical studies and she
          thought that she might be able to entice me to take the hunter exam
          earlier for me to learn about my uniqueness I already know about men
          and no way am I learning from someone who can tell when I am lying or
          not I need to disappear for a little then I will apply for graduation
          immediately I don't want her following me even 2 years later at the
          age of 20 I still think about my meeting with her but that isn't so
          important anymore I look at the trees around me and I can't help but
          reminisce a little after that meeting with cheel I graduated that year
          and went to the heavens Arena I got until the 199th floor got the
          money I won and left immediately I won 20000 Jenny I also did some
          procedures to raise my poison and electricity immunity it was very
          painful and harsh but I know I will need it my resistance is still not
          at zoric Family level but if they had a 10 resistance I have around
          seven I also know that the guide for this year's Hunter exam is in
          zaban city which is close to D Harbor I also now have a way to compare
          my strength now that I have seen some fights from the 200th floor I
          would have competed to become floor master and I might have been able
          to become one with some luck and by crushing some beginners in the
          200th floor but if I met any strong Freaks Like Hoka I would be
          crippled or dead now that I am back in my hometown to make M inability
          I think back on my struggles if I trained another 10 to 15 years I
          would be a lot stronger than this and I might reach my absolute limit
          by then but I don't have time like that in 10 years Canon will start
          and the only Advanced men technique I know is gyo because I am just
          going to be wasting time if I try to learn the others with my talent I
          can hold Reen active for one hour Gan and kilua could do it for 3
          hours with only a minuscule amount of training compared to me Not only
          would it be hard and time consuming knowing those abilities won't even
          help me create my hatsu ability then I go into the forest and use my
          aren a gentle white Rippling Aura comes out I then put my hand forward
          facing the sky and think about my ability and say to myself myen
          expend yourself and give the ability chapter 4 flash minin
          concentrates in my hand as if it is all being sucked into it like
          there is a whirlpool on the palm of my hand slowly Min enformed into a
          square type and a normal looking tablet appears on my hand I
          immediately stop my Reen and go to 10 which stops my aura from leaking
          away I keep this always active to slow down my aging I look at the
          reflective screen okay the tablet contrary to my real age I have a
          face that looks like a 16-year-old but I am taller than the average
          one I'm 185 M 61 with black hair and brown eyes with a good-look face
          and a pair of glasses I don't really need the glasses but it puts my
          opponents off guard sometimes and they think I don't have a strong
          body I mean it's not that big of an advantage but I will get whatever
          I can I think of my hatsu that was thankfully created hatsu gamer Body
          Soul control an ability to grow physical stats then amount and then
          Talent with exp from killing living organisms the stronger the
          organism the more exsp I get physical abilities do not degrade from
          not training condition one the organisms must have their n open or be
          at least as strong as the average Hunter physically to get exp from
          them two can't take exp from an organism that is killed by someone
          else three after you kill them you must touch their body with your
          right hand while having the tablet in the other hand then the body
          will become Sparkles of light and enter the tablet to become exp four
          after I upgrade my nen amount or talent in my status page I can't use
          nen for one day five phys physical training gives exp directly to the
          stat that is being trained until it gets to the next level it won't
          get a rise in power no matter even if the stat is 1 exp away from
          leveling up X LVL 44950 exp it will still be the same power as being
          only Z exp in that level X LVL 450 exp that is my hatsu finally
          haahaha I immediately have to force myself to calm down and look at my
          tablet there is only one app in it called status and I click on it and
          I see my attributes Jax Miller age 20 Talent 50100 exp exp zero St LVL
          5 4,100 exp AG LVL 52100 exp n LVL 5 9,100 exp n Mount LVL 542 ,100
          exp the status represent with LVL of certain stats stats are ranked
          like this LVL power one normal baby two normal teen three normal adult
          four trained human five normal men user Hunter six strong men user
          strong Hunter seven Phantom troop n user eight cwlo zoric level nine
          Royal Guard level 10 King level marum that is just a general way of
          ranking stats aren't everything for example just because a phantom
          troop member has stats lower or higher than level seven doesn't matter
          what is used to calculate this is that they have one Stat or maybe two
          stats at level seven and the others one number lower or even two
          numbers if they have a rare hatsu for example yuin probably has seven
          strength seven endurance and six agility while feton has six strength
          six endurance and he has seven agility but of course battles aren't
          dependent completely on stats I think feton would defeat yagin in
          battle because of his special ability which is the more he is hurt the
          more heat produces his Rising Sun ability well anyways the most
          important part of my ability is the ability to raise Talent also if I
          raise talent I will become more talented not in Just In N but in other
          things like cooking driving Etc obviously normal people have talent in
          some things and no talent in other things but my talent is universal
          of course no matter how talented you are you need some foundational
          knowledge on the subject mine is at five which is average I have made
          the level 10 of talent be like gon's Talent of nen I believe moram had
          more than 10 in Talent especially with his devour type special nen
          ability also no manipulators will be able to control me because for
          manipulators it's the early bird gets the worm though technically I am
          already controlled by my own ability so it won't work I am also
          planning on taking the hunter exam this year I kept looking around the
          forest to make sure no one came here when I was doing my hatsu special
          ability creation after making sure I immediately take out my phone and
          call someone crying then a voice which I can't even tell the gender of
          comes through the line who are you when I hear this I just calmly
          answer hey Zed I need some info then the voice comes back more clearly
          this time and it is easily identified as a man and he says sure man
          what do you need I just ask him in a calm voice when and where is the
          hunter exam I hear him ruffle through something and then say sure man
          just he then starts explaining the info and giving me all the details
          that I need to know even some passwords Etc Zed is a guy I met during
          my stay in Heaven's Arena he is an information broker but he doesn't
          have nen but he is good at getting information anyway after some time
          I end the call and wire him a million Jenny well then time to take the
          hunter exam my journey finally starts chapter 5 2 days later after
          creating my hatsu I left my hometown and I am currently outside of a
          huge skyscraper to the public this is a famous building of a real
          estate businessman he is a hunter too so it makes sense that his
          building is being being used as an entry to the hunter exam I am
          currently wearing a black suit with hidden blades inside it even a gun
          and I also have a black briefcase in my hand and I am also wearing my
          usual fake glasses I have my black hair covering my forehead and
          giving off a friendly Vibe when I go inside I notice people in
          business suits going about their business I see the receptionist and I
          immediately go towards her when she sees me approaching her she just
          looks at me and smiles while saying in a happy voice what can I help
          you with sir damn she seems genuinely happy to see me what a good
          actress even I can't seem to pinpoint her act I just smile towards her
          and say in a friendly voice with a small friendly smile on my face I
          would like the room in the back her expression doesn't change at all
          and still with a smile on her face she says oh sir that would be on
          floor 35 room number 17A I just nod and go towards the elev elevator
          when I see that it reads out of order H has the test already started
          well that is no big deal I am already prepared I just turn around and
          go towards the staircase and start going up the stairs after 10 floors
          I finally see some people who probably came before me they are resting
          most of them have backpacks and seem like they are ready to live in
          the wilderness I keep walking and walking I see more and more people
          on the side resting as I am counting floors when I arrive at the 31st
          floor I see a huge crowd of people in here and trying to get into a
          room which has a sign with 17A written on it as soon as I saw this I
          couldn't help but think that they have been tricked the receptionist
          said on floor 35 so that must mean that this is a fake then as not to
          alarm anyone I use zetsu and dull my presence to not let anyone notice
          me less people means less competition after all then I go up to the
          35th floor and I start walking along the hallway until I arrive at a
          door labeled as 17A and I enter it there I see that it is like a giant
          classroom with around 170 people in it there also seemed to be some
          people sitting on chairs in the sides of the classroom they had
          notebooks in their hands I look around and don't see anyone from the
          hxh Cannon story seeing that I just find an empty desk and sit on it
          after 3 hours a guy with a bandan dark trench coat and a scar along
          his face comes in and he immediately says in a harsh cold voice I
          wonder how many of you will die this time as he says that he has an
          annoyed look on his face after some awkward silence a muscular bald
          guy who is sitting in the front gets up and walks in front of the
          scared Hunter he snear at him and says I have been here for 5 hours
          and I am honestly tired how about me and you fight right now and get
          this over with I get a hunter's license and you get the beating you
          deserve I will allow you to decide the rules of the fight the exam
          Proctor just looks at him the annoyed look on his face is gone and I
          could see his n leak out expressing his anger the muscular guy in
          front of him immediately falls to his knees the Proctor doesn't say
          anything as he takes out a knife and says Okay I accept your challenge
          and I choose a death match and with a clean and elegant motion flash
          he decapitates the bald muscular exam participant after killing the
          muscular man casually tells one of the guys with the notebook to take
          the body out and throw it onto the garbage disposal some of the
          contestants pale the exam Proctor just turns around like nothing
          happened and he says well then let me explain this exam he just starts
          explaining the exam as if nothing really even happened it is pretty
          much a written exam and if you are caught cheating you will be
          eliminated so you must complete the exam which consists of 10
          questions during the allocated time also the 10th question will be
          given during the last 10 minutes after the exam Proctor explained it
          he had the notebook guys give us the exam papers when I look at my
          exam paper quite easy I finished it in 15 minutes the time that I have
          left is 45 minutes seeing that I have nothing to do I secretly use gyo
          to concentrate nen into my eyes and see if there is any hidden n user
          around I found two nen users who were trying to hide by allowing their
          n to flow like a regular human also there are two others a blonde
          female and male they are sitting next to each other so I will assume
          the worst case scenario that they are together the guy also has some
          type of war paint into his face I will need to be careful there are
          four men users during this Hunter exam after all that is finished we
          are asked if we want to take the 10th question also some people got
          caught cheating and were escorted outside they didn't dare reject they
          already saw what happened to someone who tried to go against the exam
          Proctor if we do take it and don't answer it correctly then we will
          fail and will never be able to take it again some people do give up
          pathetic pieces of sht they came this far and they still can't see
          underneath that statement at the end there are only 97 people left
          then the exam Proctor just adjusts his bandana a little and
          nonchalantly says there was no other question you all pass they were
          just scaredy cat cats that didn't deserve to even be here then he
          starts going towards the door and says follow me to the rooftop there
          we will meet our transportation vehicle for the next part of the exam
          after some time and me following him to the 100th floor and then the
          rooftop some more people fell during the journey and now there are
          only 75 participants left when we arrive at the rooftop the exam
          Proctor says in a casual voice they should be here anytime now Sue
          goodbye it hasn't been a pleasure meeting you he then goes to the roof
          elevator he pressed the button and an out of order sign showed up then
          as if remembering something he takes a card out of his trench coat the
          card has the hunter Association logo in it he just swipes it in the
          front of the elevator and ping the elevator door opens so it really
          was working all along huh I wonder if some poor fool just walked all
          this way without somehow even realizing chapter 6 then after a couple
          of minutes I see a giant blimp appear from the sky and soon I see
          someone jump from the sky towards the ground Flash and it opens a
          parachute the person who lands on the ground is a woman who looks
          around her 20s she has light brown pupiless eyes her hair color is
          violet and it is styled in a short spiky fann ponytail she is wearing
          a fitted mesh bodysuit that covers her from her neck down to her
          thighs over this she is also wearing a tan Overcoat with a purple
          inseam and a pocket on each side a dark orange miniskirt with a dark
          blue belt she also has some good SE cups on her she then Smiles
          brightly towards our group and cheerfully says hey there I am Kona and
          I will be your next exam Proctor I am sure that you are all hungry I
          am not as cruel as the emo Scarface so I have prepared a lot of food
          on the blimp so you guys can rest and relax the next exam will start
          after 2 days the people around me seem to physically relax and somehow
          trust the woman in front of us they must be glad that she is not like
          the Proctor before her who killed an exam participant just because he
          dared to raise his voice but looks can be deceiving after getting on
          the blimp and looking at the food I secretly test the food with a thin
          needle for any corrosive type poison at after doing that test then I
          started eating like everyone else I finally finish eating and start
          going outside I look at the paper that was given to us when we entered
          here it separates our sleeping quarters there are five living quarters
          I just look at the map and go towards the bar on the Airship when I
          arrive there I see that only a couple of participants are drinking how
          dumb are they to drink in a ship full of people who are ready to kill
          you then I also notice our exam Proctor who is talking with the
          bartender who is a person in a suit with lavender hair that curls at
          the end his most distinctive feature is his lack of mouth isn't he the
          exam Proctor during the time gone took his Hunter's exam I decide to
          go towards them as soon as I do so they stop talking and look towards
          me I sit next to my exam Proctor then I look at the bartender and
          smile towards him while saying can I have a shot of whiskey he just
          nods and goes to prepare some drinks with no questions asked then my
          exam proor Kona looks at me with an amused smile and says you sure are
          a rude guy aren't you coming in here and interrupting our conversation
          like that even when she says that I act cly and calmly put my
          briefcase on the table I then look towards her smile and say in a
          friendly tone ah sorry if I did that it's just that all of these
          strong people in here make me nervous she just gives me a questioning
          look and says with a smirk on her face the most most dangerous
          contestant during this time is you I just raise an eyebrow at her but
          I just ignore her and say to her in a friendly voice Sue I have a
          question then she just goes back to drinking from her glass then satat
          brings me my drinks and goes back to washing some glasses Kona just
          shrugs her shoulders and says sure ask away I don't even touch my
          drink that Sadat brought me my face becomes serious and I say to Kona
          hypothetically if all of the other contestants are not able to
          participate on the other exams and only one person is able to
          participate does that person gain a hunter's license understanding the
          meaning of my words kona's eyes widen a little and she says well that
          would depend on the exam Proctor I myself like to be sure that a
          hunter has the abilities to survive meet me after 10 hours for a
          little Spar in room NR 127 and there we will see if you have them I
          just look towards her with a serious face and then a bright smile
          appears on my face then in a happy way I say to Kona I will see you
          there then I pick up my briefcase and without even drinking my whiskey
          I just turn around and walk away while I am walking away I go towards
          one of the empty Pathways and I crouch down and open my briefcase
          inside it there are hundreds of small canisters with a gas mask in it
          I take two of the can ERS and an empty canister and mix them together
          I then put on the gas mask time to get me some exp at 400 in the
          morning while everyone is asleep I go towards each of the rooms and
          put some heavy knockout gas that will keep them down for about 5 days
          I go outside of the rooms and just wait they really seem like they are
          tired today by 5: in the morning everyone was knocked out I take out a
          scalpel from the inside of my suit and go towards the men users that I
          remembered from before when I arrive at their rooms I kill the First
          with a simple needle quickly inserted into his brain I am already used
          to death from my work in medicine and I don't necessarily feel bad if
          other people die for my benefits then I activate my hatsu the tablet
          appears into my hand and with the other hand I touch the N user's body
          and Flash chapter 7 then a notification appears on my tablet 45 exp H
          so that guy gave me 45 then let's see the others I am at the other n
          user sleeping quarters I see a bunch of other participants sleeping
          around but killing them wouldn't give me any benefits or any
          experience so there is no need for that the nin users seem to be
          sleeping together one is male and the other female maybe they are a
          couple well it doesn't matter anyway I go and kill both of them
          quickly and summon my tablet again and then I touch the headman's
          corpse first flash he turns into glittering lights and goes into my
          tablet this ability might also be good at erasing murder evidence or
          something like that this is the an aspect of my ability that I won't
          use but you never know 19 exp so this one was weaker then I turned
          towards the female men user and used the ability again she also gets
          absorbed into my tablet 22 exp after that I go outside of the room and
          I click on my only app on the tablet Jax Miller age 20 Talent LVL
          50100 exp exp 86 St Str LVL 54100 exp AG LVL 52100 exp n LVL 51,100
          exp n amount LVL 5 42,1 XP when I look at my tablet my eyes
          immediately go towards my n Mount and I wanted to upgrade it but the
          condition that when I upgrade n amount or talent I would be forced
          into a state of zetsu and become unable to use my nen I guess first I
          will spar with Kona and then I will upgrade my nen I start looking for
          room 127 around it didn't take me long to find it and when I did I
          went inside and I saw Kona standing there leaning on the wall and
          sleeping as soon as I enter the room she opens her eyes and looks at
          me are you ready I just put my briefcase down and touch a secret
          button on it without Kona noticing anything as it slowly releases
          something into the air I take off my jacket and the necktie I pull up
          my sleeve and take up a boxing stance against her I then use aren as
          my men explodes from my body reinforcing it as soon as Kona sees this
          she doesn't seem surprised at all as she just Smiles slightly and says
          nice Aura you have there then she releases her own nen I can sense
          that it is more refined but I still use G yo on my eyes for a split
          second and look at her Aura quality and such judging by it she should
          be on the stronger side of the hunter Association that is when her
          Aura starts acting strangely and it starts forming tendrils of nen and
          they turn into snakes like n creatures that are attached to her body
          she then comes towards me I jump sideways and her n snakes who are
          attached to her Aura extend and come towards me with the intent to
          bite me I still just keep dodging one of them even comes close to
          biting my arm but I just bam punch it away then suddenly the snake
          turns around and faces me again ready to attack Kona is also coming
          towards me I put my hands in my pockets and then I take out six
          scalpels and keep them between my fingers and throw them towards Kona
          flash she easily Dodges them all and her snake is close to me now then
          I stealthily put my hand in my pocket and aim my gun which is still in
          my pocket towards Kona pow pow I shot towards her 12 consecutive times
          and since she was dodging my scalpel she wasn't able to dodge all of
          the bullets and even though she had Aran active the bullets still left
          some slightly bleeding wounds on her after all not all n users can
          stop bullets like they are nothing but I still kept her n snake on my
          vision and as he was sneakily about to bite me on my leg I just bomb
          kick him away and immediately look towards the bleeding cona she just
          smirks towards me and I can see her exposed muscles tightening and
          stopping the bleeding on wounded areas damn those are some nice
          abdominal muscles well then let's see how long you can last Kona after
          a couple minutes of me just dodging suddenly Kona just bomb drops to
          her knees and falls down unconscious it took quite some time for the
          poison to take effect when I had put down my briefcase the button I
          touched activated a secret compartment that spews out poison I planed
          to keep her moving around and I would win this I am already immune to
          this type of strong poison so it doesn't work on me then I look at the
          unconscious Kona and notice something strange I see so that is it
          chapter 8 when I look at kona's unconscious body I immediately notice
          something strange I use gyo on my ears to make them slightly more
          sensitive and then I listen to kona's Heart beat I see so that is what
          is happening then I just smirk slightly and loudly say so do I pass
          the hunter exam cona then suddenly kona's unconscious body stirred a
          little and she got up she turned around and looked at me with a smile
          on her face sure you are a hunter now you will just have to wait to
          get your pro hunter card I just nod and go to put on my suit's jacket
          and then grab the briefcase and as I am about to walk out I hear Kona
          say to me by the way how were you able to tell that I was faking it I
          just turned towards her and raise an eyebrow at her and say it was my
          hatsu but how were you able to resist the paralysis poison she just
          smiles and points with her thumb towards her chest in Pride and she
          says of course I can resist a little poison like that I am a poison
          Hunter after all if it was any other Hunter you would have undoubtedly
          defeated them also when did you start spreading the poison I didn't
          quite notice that I just smirk at her and say it was my hat Sue
          ability and just walk away she just puts at this liar I just smirk and
          push my glasses up obviously three people can keep a secret only if
          two are dead as I think I get out of the room and start walking away
          when I walk enough far away I immediately feel a little light headed
          the poison was kind of too strong even for me I immediately took a
          vial from my briefcase and drank it this was an anti then I go towards
          the lounge area I summon my tablet and look at my exp I won't upgrade
          anything yet I will wait until I have enough exp to upgrade my talent
          I then lie down on a big couch damn that was tiring anyway I better go
          to sleep now I am quite tired after 3 days of me just exploring around
          the Airship I found out that there was a training room so here I am
          pulling on some 600 kg weights and I am completely naked while
          training I don't want my suit to become sweat sweaty or anything like
          that I am trying to train my physical stats but it isn't having a lot
          of results I only got four exp on strength two on agility and seven on
          endurance so far the easiest stat to train has been endurance the
          other examinees are still knocked out and sleeping my knockout poison
          was very effective and expensive too I didn't want to leave any
          loopholes in my plans but as I continue training I hear the door of
          the room open when I look at the direction of the door I see Kona when
          she looks at me she immediately freezes in shock I just look towards
          her with my nonchalant face and say to her did you need something Kona
          then she gets out of her trace and keeps looking at my lower body she
          just blushes and covers her face on room number one the chairman is
          waiting for you I just nod towards her and go towards the showers cona
          POV as I look at his back with Rippling compact muscles I immediately
          drop my innocent Act and I can't help but lick my lips a little a now
          I want him really bad no no Kona you must control yourself but a
          little peeking will harm no one as I make a little snake for my aura
          and materialize it to make it look like a real snake the snake then
          falls on the ground and start slithering towards the showers I close
          my eyes and my vision Chans as I start seeing what the snake sees go
          on my after 10 minutes of me spying on him he comes out of the shower
          with his glasses and his suit on looking all prim and proper a I want
          to have a go with him he then comes towards me when he is to my side
          he puts his hand on my shoulder and nonchalantly says you really need
          to hide those predatory eyes of yours they give away your true
          intentions as soon as I hear that I am shaken away from my fantasies
          and truly feel a little embarrassed now damn this is embarrassing
          Jack's POV as I leave behind a shocked Kona I can't help but smirk at
          her reaction I mean I do do not have the best perception but a snake
          on the bathroom yay I am definitely noticing that one only by using
          guo and seeing that it was made out of men did I understand what is
          really going on anyway I start walking towards room number one when I
          arrive there I open the door and see an old man sitting on the ground
          drinking tea with a short table in front of him I immediately
          recognized him as the hunter Association chairman Neo he looks at me
          with a smiling face he looks the same as he did during the anime
          except that his beard is a little shorter this guy really is old he
          then says with a childish smile on his face oh so you are the only one
          who passed the exam this year I just look at him there is no need for
          me to even use gyo to see his Aura I can already feel it his Aura is
          quite massive and at perfect control chapter n Neo just looks at me
          with a childish questioning look then he just hums to himself for some
          seconds before seemingly coming to a decision then he says to me since
          Kona spoke so highly of you you can have your hunter's license when he
          says that he has an unreadable look on his face he takes a hunter's
          card from his pocket and gives it to me he has a certain amused look
          on his eyes that I can't read at all damn I don't like people like
          that at all use this carefully now Move Along he says pulling me out
          of my thoughts I just take my hunter card and immediately turn around
          and start walking away I didn't even say anything anything to him I
          open the door and go outside as soon as I was outside I breathed out a
          sigh of relief I am pretty sure Neo just assessed my potential just
          from that look and I bet he didn't see anything special at least I am
          sure he didn't I couldn't read his true intentions at all I am only
          making assumptions based on what I know of his personality from the
          hxh anime better get out of this Airship I need to start getting
          stronger faster or I will never be able to compete with monsters like
          him and when Canon comes around I want to be able to at least compete
          with Maron just to feel safe one day later I am finally getting off
          that Airship I can now start truly getting stronger also no one even
          mentioned The Disappearance of the three men users from the Airship I
          guess when you design a death game you can't exactly ask other people
          not to kill after that since I was dropped in an Airship station I
          immediately go to the receptionist and ask for another flight I need a
          flight for the Valley of Death the receptionist is about to refuse my
          request but I I just show her my pro hunter card and she just nods and
          gives me a ticket to the Valley of Death the valley of death is a
          dangerous place with vicious beasts that could easily kill humans it
          is a restricted place but with my hunter card I can easily
