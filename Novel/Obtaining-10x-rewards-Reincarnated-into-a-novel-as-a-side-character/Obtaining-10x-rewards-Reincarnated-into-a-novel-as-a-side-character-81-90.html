        <h2>Chapter 81: Display the talisman! Confused children.</h2>
        <p>
          Had he not witnessed it firsthand, he would have never believed that a
          feeble novice exorcist candidate like Oliver could accomplish such a
          feat!
        </p>
        <p>What exactly were those two martial arts techniques?</p>
        <p>Who had imparted them to him?</p>
        <p>Was there someone involved in this scenario?</p>
        <p>
          Was Mistress Ophelia wrong about his initial evaluation at his birth?
          Unlikely, but now he was even more curious about this child.
        </p>
        <p>What was going on then…?</p>
        <p>
          He couldn't resist probing him once more, only to yield the same
          results as before.
        </p>
        <p>Barely any espera worth noting.</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and ushered the group of children towards the
          judges.
        </p>
        <p>
          They would determine the course of action and wielded greater
          authority than him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was also keen to observe their reaction to Oliver, given that they
          all bore witness to his earlier actions in the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          With haste, he directed them to another area while the other guards
          escorted the children still within the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver spotted some chairs, and a few people were seated upon them.
        </p>
        <p>
          These chairs were arranged on a raised platform or stage of sorts.
        </p>

        <p>
          The judges sat with an air of authority, their eyes scanning the group
          of children with keen interest. They had details about each of them, a
          full-detailed profile.
        </p>
        <p>
          The children congregated, the air was thick with tension as they took
          out their talismans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver glanced around, and suddenly, his gaze locked with the second
          brother's, who appeared to be casually scanning the surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second brother, upon seeing Oliver, inexplicably felt a chill run
          down his spine, causing his hand to tremble…
        </p>
        <p>Was he experiencing fear?</p>
        <p>
          Swiftly, he averted his gaze, focusing straight ahead. Sweat began to
          form on his brow, bewildered by the sensation engulfing him. His mind
          recoiled from even glancing in Oliver's direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he attempted to recall where he had encountered him before, a sharp
          pain seared through his head. Dizziness washed over him, dissuading
          any further contemplation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever the cause, whether instinctual or otherwise, it vehemently
          advised him to steer clear of Oliver at all costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Observing this reaction, Oliver felt a sense of satisfaction. This was
          the consequence one faced for crossing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Approach! One by one! Place your talisman on the altar to unseal the
          demon. The judges will then assess it."
        </p>
        <p>
          The first child approached, trembling slightly, and positioned his
          talisman on the altar.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was among those who failed to exit the forest on time and thus was
          escorted out by guards.
        </p>
        <p>The altar hummed to life as the talisman glowed.</p>
        <p>
          A small, pathetic-looking demon corpse emerged out in front of the
          altar, eliciting a mixture of relief and disappointment from the
          audience.
        </p>
        <p>The judges conferred briefly, their interest seemingly minimal.</p>
        <p>
          Well, Oliver mused, it was challenging to pique their interest; these
          demons hardly warranted a glance from them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next was a confident girl, previously a favorite to win. Oliver had
          noticed her at the outset, surrounded by a retinue of followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was evident her family lineage was exceptional, the vassal family
          enjoying a higher status than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          She unsealed her talisman, revealing a fierce and imposing demon
          corpse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The judges nodded approvingly, and she stepped back, a satisfied smile
          adorning her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          After her was the kid who had brought his ancestor's sword with him,
          earlier at the beginning he was quite arrogant and confident but now
          he seemed more humbled and subdued.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even his face was covered in dirt and his clothes were also torn from
          here and there.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was apparent the demons he had underestimated had imparted a
          valuable lesson.
        </p>
        <p>The demon he presented was mediocre at best.</p>
        <p>Children came and went by. The process continued.</p>
        <p>
          Finally, it was the second brother's turn. He unveiled his talisman
          before the audience.
        </p>
        <p>"Look at that!"</p>
        <p>"Isn't that a minor-level demon!?"</p>
        <p>
          "As expected from the main lineage, they are born different." A boy
          could not help but shake his head, his demon was at best a 5 out of 10
          rating.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's so handsome as well, I want to join under him…" A girl gushed,
          admiring his appearance.
        </p>
        <p>The crowd buzzed with conversation.</p>
        <p>"Not bad," one of the judges calmly remarked, jotting down notes.</p>

        <p>
          Oliver also looked at the demon corpse, the demon had a bald head and
          wide teeth with a large belly. It was indeed a minor-level demon.
        </p>
        <p>The rotations continued until finally, it was his turn!</p>
        <p>"Hey, it's his turn…"</p>
        <p>"Tch, did he even capture one?"</p>
        <p>"Seems impossible. Maybe it's an empty talisman haha."</p>
        <p>
          "Haha. It's a shame the main lineage's esteemed reputation might
          suffer due to him."
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally his name was called. He stepped forward, his heart pounding
          slightly, it was the moment where his cover was going to get blown
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been trying to hide his powers but unfortunately since that was
          no longer feasible, it was time to reveal it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although his cover had long been blown away considering they all were
          watching them, but it was still a different story doing it in front of
          so many people.
        </p>
        <p>
          He calmly went up to the altar and slowly placed his talisman onto the
          circular platform.
        </p>
        <p>Whirr…</p>
        <p>
          A light shone as the audience waited for the spectacle, some were
          eagerly waiting for the drama that was going to unfold once Oliver
          revealed his pathetic talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elders remained composed, their eyes betraying a knowingness. They
          were well aware of each child's accomplishments. The judging process
          merely served to establish a hierarchy among them.
        </p>
        <p>
          They ought to discern their competition and select the appropriate
          figure to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cadaver of a robust and imposing demon gradually materialized
          before the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          Silence blanketed the audience as they gawked at the demon in
          disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Umm… hey, isn't this a minor-level demon?" someone finally spoke,
          their tone hesitant.
        </p>
        <p>"A minor-level demon! He actually captured one!?"</p>
        <p>
          "What!? How's this possible? I still can't feel any noticeable espera
          from him!?"
        </p>
        <p>"What's going on!?"</p>
        <p>
          Nadia calmly observed the situation from a distance, her eyes had a
          certain glint to them as she watched.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 82: Nadia reveals her demon</h2>
        <p>
          Another girl thought aloud, "Could it be that his espera level is too
          high for us to sense? Is that why we were unable to feel anything?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh… wait, this does sound logical…" Another kid also had a
          thoughtful look.
        </p>
        <p>
          "In the first place, wasn't it someone else who said that Young Master
          Oliver was isolated due to his incompetent talent since birth?"
        </p>
        <p>"Y-You're right. But where's that guy?"</p>
        <p>
          "I think I saw him get eliminated at the beginning when he was unable
          to climb the elder's familiar."
        </p>
        <p>"Fuck! That bastard dared to trick us!" someone raged out.</p>
        <p>
          "Actually, we are the fools here. How could a person from the main
          lineage lack talent? Their blood is divine."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am ashamed that I thought like this… To think I dared to disrespect
          one of the main heirs just due to my lack of knowledge. M-My father is
          going to beat me up if he finds out." A boy said in fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing this, many others showed anxious faces, especially those who
          had openly bad-mouthed him since the beginning. They disrespected a
          main heir thinking he was talentless and weak just because someone
          said so, and now they saw this scene of him casually showcasing a
          minor-level demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had also been in the forest, and the demons were not easy to
          hunt. Not to mention the minor-level ones; even the weaker ones were
          very troubling and ferocious. Just facing them alone was extremely
          stressful. They could only imagine how tough a minor-level demon was.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be able to kill that demon and seal it… he was definitely not weak.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for cheating? They did not even have such a thought. The whole
          event was being monitored by the clan elders, who were impartial. Any
          sort of cheating would immediately result in disqualification and
          punishment.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their parents had repeatedly informed them to maintain the best
          possible ties with the main heirs.
        </p>
        <p>They had specifically told them one thing:</p>
        <p>
          "If you cannot maintain a good tie, then don't get on their bad side
          no matter what."
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who had jabbed at him earlier were secretly cursing themselves
          for being too talkative. They had done this to impress the pair of
          third siblings and get their favor, but who would have expected they
          would actually offend such a monster instead?
        </p>
        <p>
          They could still bootlick the third pair of siblings and get under
          their wing to have some ground, but…
        </p>
        <p>Where were they?</p>
        <p>Wait, they could not find the pair of siblings anywhere?</p>
        <p>"???"</p>
        <p>
          "Respected elder, uhm, where are the third young master and young
          miss?" A guy could not help but ask. He was one of the people who had
          quite actively berated Oliver, so he was more anxious than others.
        </p>
        <p>"They have been disqualified."</p>
        <p>The elder glanced at the kid and coldly said.</p>
        <p>
          As if a thunderbolt had struck their minds, they all looked at the
          elder with confusion and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>Disqualified?</p>

        <p>What happened? Did they cheat?</p>
        <p>
          Their faces turned pale upon hearing the elder's words. The elder did
          not explain anything further and simply walked away from this annoying
          bunch of children.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm. Not bad, young master…"</p>
        <p>
          One of the judges commented with a certain look in his eyes. He wanted
          to ask more but could not do so. Oliver still had the status of being
          one of the main heirs, so he couldn't casually ask him about his
          secrets—especially not when he was not even related to Oliver's
          faction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head judge leaned forward, his eyes narrowing. "This is a rare
          find," he said, his voice tinged with both contemplation and serenity.
          "Where did you capture this demon, Oliver?"
        </p>
        <p>"In the forest."</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver nonchalantly replied, making the judges speechless. Upon second
          thought, they all felt that Oliver was indeed not wrong, so why did
          they feel offended?
        </p>
        <p>The judges exchanged glances, their expressions unreadable.</p>
        <p>
          Afterward, they sent him back and called out the rest of the
          participants.
        </p>
        <p>It was almost the end, and now it was Nadia's turn.</p>
        <p>She was called out, and the noisy crowd instantly quieted down.</p>
        <p>The air was filled with unexpected anticipation.</p>

        <p>
          Everyone had a look of eagerness in their eyes as they watched her
          reach the altar and place her talisman upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was the most likely candidate to become the future matriarch of
          the clan. There was not a single person in the crowd who did not want
          to become her subordinate and join her faction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But of course, they all knew that only the best of the best would even
          get a chance to serve her.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all wanted to see what sort of demon she had captured. It would
          be a show of her strength for the first time in public.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia had no interest in her eyes. She had an expressionless face at
          the moment, and the world did not seem to affect her at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light on the talisman shone, and a demon emerged out of the altar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before anyone could respond, the demon hissed out, its voice echoing
          through the silent surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>Hiss!</p>
        <p>The onlookers could not help but be stunned.</p>
        <p>The demon was alive!?</p>
        <p>How did she manage to seal it then?</p>
        <p>Even the judges had a look of interest upon seeing the demon.</p>
        <p>
          A thunder-attributed demon was definitely harder to fight compared to
          non-attributed demons. And to seal one alive at their level? This task
          was almost impossible to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could not help but have a sense of respect for Nadia. She was
          indeed the most talented in the main lineage. Not even a Rank-1
          exorcist and still able to seal a minor-level demon alive? She was
          definitely not normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chaos erupted as the crowd reacted. The judges struggled to regain
          control.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, the head judge raised his hand for silence.</p>
        <p>
          "This is unexpected," he said, looking at Nadia with a mix of
          curiosity and interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A rare find, as expected of Miss Nadia." A judge clapped lightly as
          he congratulated her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The crowd could not help but be envious. The judges did not even react
          when it was their turn, but now they were going as far as to
          congratulate her and clap for her.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 83: Celestial Flame Lotus! Waiting for 10x benefits!</h2>
        <p>
          The crowd could not help but be envious. The judges did not even react
          when it was their turn, but now they were even going as far as to
          congratulate her and clap for her. This just showed her influence and
          how strong she would grow in the future. It was a fitting show of
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignoring everything around, Nadia could not help but glance sideways
          secretly, trying to find out how Oliver reacted. In the end, she saw
          him clapping for her as well and felt satisfied. Her lips wanted to
          curl up, but she restrained herself. Her mother might also be
          watching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver glanced as the elder clicked his fingers, and the demon was
          instantly sliced into two halves and quickly assimilated into
          nothingness.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was an exorcism technique… only exorcists with espera could use
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head judge stood and called for silence once more. "We have
          reached our decision. The rankings are as follows…"
        </p>
        <p>[1st: Nadia Mystic]</p>
        <p>[2nd: Oliver Mystic]</p>
        <p>[3rd: Violet Mitchell]</p>
        <p>[4th: …]</p>

        <p>
          As he announced the names and ranks, there were gasps and murmurs of
          surprise. Some of the expected top contenders were ranked lower than
          anticipated, while others who had been overlooked rose to prominence.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Oliver's name was called, he was placed among the highest ranks,
          but the judges gave him a look that promised further scrutiny for some
          reason.
        </p>
        <p>Good, I placed second. The reward should be good.</p>
        <p>
          He felt happy that he placed second. Actually, he was more glad that
          Nadia placed first, which meant that she was going to receive a better
          reward, and he would enjoy the tenfold benefits too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing Oliver laughing weirdly to himself, the others didn't know what
          to say. In the end, they just ignored him and went to rest. The
          previous night had taken a toll on them mentally and physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The winners stay while the rest leave. We will distribute the
          rewards," the elder announced as he guided the rest of the
          participants away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group of rankers were also taken to a chamber with the judges and
          other clan elites present as well. Oliver was quite surprised when he
          heard that the second brother was not the runner-up but instead some
          unknown girl. Nonetheless, the judges had their own criteria, and he
          did not care.
        </p>
        <p>
          After they were led to the chamber, the head judge informed them. "For
          the 3rd rank, you will receive a secret martial arts technique from
          the clan. You have three choices, select one of them wisely."
        </p>
        <p>
          He said to Violet and presented three notebooks with the technique
          name written on the cover. She took a moment and carefully analyzed
          her compatibility. All the techniques were top-notch for their level
          and foundation. In the end, she selected a technique called [Purple
          Snap of the Hateful Snakes]. It seemed to focus on hand-to-hand
          combat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good, you can leave now if you want or wait for other participants,"
          he told her, and she decided to stay and wait.
        </p>
        <p>
          "For the second rank, the reward is a choice between these two
          metals." He clapped as two glass boxes with some sort of radiating
          metal placed inside appeared on the table. There were two labels on
          the boxes: one was Terrorgold of Spirits, and the second was Hellish
          Plant Meteor. He was supposed to select one.
        </p>

        <p>
          "This one." Oliver wanted both, but he knew that it was impossible, so
          he picked one as per his needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder nodded and gave the box to Oliver and told him about it.
          "Hellish Plant Meteor. This metal is extremely precious. If you give
          it to a skilled blacksmith, you can get yourself a wonderful weapon or
          even an artifact. It depends on the skill of the crafter in the end.
          Many exorcists try their best to get a piece of it, but it's not
          something to be obtained easily. This metal could only be extracted
          from demonic territory and thus is very hard to mine."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded slightly. He was aware of this and thus chose it. He had
          already collected some metals prior to this, and with this, he was one
          step closer to implementing his plan. There was something that he
          wanted to be crafted, so he had been collecting the metal necessary
          for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now for the 1st ranker, Miss Nadia, you will receive a truly unique
          reward," the head judge announced, his voice resonating with pride and
          anticipation. "As the first-place winner, you will be granted the
          Celestial Flame Lotus, an ancient artifact passed down through our
          clan for generations."
        </p>
        <p>
          He gestured towards a pedestal at the center of the chamber, where a
          delicate lotus flower made of shimmering, translucent material sat. It
          radiated a soft, otherworldly glow, and the air around it seemed to
          ripple with energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Celestial Flame Lotus is not just a symbol of our clan's
          heritage; it possesses incredible power. When bonded with its owner,
          it can enhance your espera, amplify your martial arts abilities, and
          provide protection against dark espera. However, it requires great
          skill and dedication to fully unlock its potential."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia looked at the artifact with eagerness. She had heard about it,
          and this was what she had been aiming for when she participated in the
          first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head judge continued, "This artifact chooses its master. You must
          meditate and form a bond with it. Only then will it reveal its true
          abilities to you. Use it wisely; it will become a great weapon in
          times of great need."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia nodded solemnly. She didn't underestimate the head judge.
          Rather, she was not a person to underestimate others based on their
          strength; she was wary of everyone, be it friend or enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, Oliver's image came to her mind as she thought about the
          artifact, but she quickly shook her head. She had a great
          responsibility on her shoulders and thus could not be held back.
        </p>
        <p>
          She gently picked up the Celestial Flame Lotus, feeling its warmth and
          energy resonate with her own. "You may stay and meditate here to form
          your bond," the head judge said. "Take all the time you need. This is
          an honor that few have achieved."
        </p>
        <p>
          As Nadia found a quiet corner to begin her meditation, the room buzzed
          with a mix of admiration and envy from the other participants. Even
          some elders could not help but sigh. This artifact was something that
          even they would have wanted in their prime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver watched curiously. He was brimming with curiosity as he
          wondered what abilities she was going to awaken and how much profit he
          would gain. He turned towards the head judge and suddenly called out.
        </p>
        <p>"Elder, I have something to ask…"</p>

        <h2>Chapter 84: Obtaining 10x benefits! Holy Flames?</h2>
        <p>
          "Elder, I have something to ask..." Oliver called out to the elder,
          who was looking over at Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is it, young master?" The elder turned around and asked calmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I wanted to ask if I can have the corpse of the demon I
          hunted?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm?" The elder narrowed his eyes slightly when he heard Oliver. But
          he quickly replied with a calm look. "You can... but may I know the
          reason behind it? The demon corpse isn't something worth collecting
          either."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, well, I was thinking of selling it to earn some money," Oliver
          simply replied. There was nothing to hide considering they could know
          it either way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing this, all the people in the room were stunned, and then they
          once again looked at the young man. They had forgotten earlier that
          this guy was actually the isolated one; the clan had minimal
          interactions with him, and he didn't have most of the privileges that
          the other young heirs had.
        </p>
        <p>
          So naturally, that also involved the monthly expenses he received,
          which must be minimal too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third place winner could not help but look at Oliver in pity. Such
          a strong person, and he was being treated like this. She couldn't help
          but shudder, imagining herself in his place. Her family had always
          showered her with resources and wealth, so she never had to care about
          something as trivial as money.
        </p>
        <p>
          But looking at how he was so poor that he even wanted to sell the
          demon corpse to get some money made her feel inferior. If she were one
          day thrown out into the wild with minimal money, how would she
          survive? She mentally made a note to herself to be more frugal after
          returning back to her family home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elders who heard him had weird expressions as well. A young master
          of the clan was actually so poor that he had to live by selling
          corpses in the market? If others heard about it, they would be reduced
          to a laughing stock. It was not only a matter of pride but also to
          respect the strength that this young man showed.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter what, he definitely had potential. Being able to hunt a
          minor-level demon after fighting two heirs was no easy feat for his
          age.
        </p>

        <p>
          The head judge's expression did not falter a bit as he listened to his
          reasoning. "No need for that. You will be allocated funds from the
          clan treasury from now on."
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned toward an elder and waved his hand. "Increase his funds to
          be double of what the third siblings get per month. Also, compensate
          him with the money for all the six years that he had received less
          than others. It should not be a Neden less."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, elder." The other elder quickly cupped his hands and nodded,
          swiftly leaving the chamber to get the money. Since the head judge had
          ordered it, there was no need to further discuss about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was astonished after hearing this. This was completely out of
          his expectations. He never imagined that not only would he be
          allocated twice the pocket money of the siblings but also get
          compensated with six years worth of funds that he had missed.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought the clan would simply ignore this matter, usually in the
          novels, even if the protagonist happens to showcase his powers, the
          clan still does not treat him well and instead try to bring him down,
          but it turns out that his clan indeed stood firm to its beliefs of
          respecting strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, he was not short of money or anything after meeting Jenna; he
          had millions in his card. It was just that he had been a calculative
          person and had a habit of saving money since his previous life. He
          always believed the more money, the better. So his decision to sell
          the demon corpse was definitely not influenced by his lack of
          sufficient funds.
        </p>
        <p>
          He just felt it would be a great opportunity to sell the skin of a
          minor-level demon. He didn't expect the others to feel pity for him
          and this to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now he could not ask for the demon corpse, or it would be rude to
          the head judge who had already told him that there was no need.
          Anyway, there would be more opportunities in the future as he fought
          more demons.
        </p>
        <p>For now, he was satisfied with the unexpected profit.</p>
        <p>
          Now, he just waited for Nadia to finish bonding with the artifact
          while his money arrived.
        </p>

          [Ding! The target has formed a bond with Celestial Flame Lotus and
          awakened the Demon Banishing Flames.]

        <p>[Obtaining 10x benefits...]</p>
        <p>[Host has obtained Holy Flame of Nightmares.]</p>
        <p>
          In that very instant, Oliver felt a warm feeling inside his body, as
          if his entire body was slowly getting hotter and hotter with every
          moment. The heat was becoming unbearable; it felt as if he had been
          thrown into a boiling volcano.
        </p>
        <p>
          He breathed in and out slowly, trying not to draw attention to himself
          but found it harder to concentrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, Nadia also reacted at the same time as a strong espera
          started leaking out of her body, drawing others' attention. Oliver
          took the chance and quietly left the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>"Umm..."</p>
        <p>
          He huffed slightly as he went into the bushes. The heat was becoming
          unbearable slowly; he wanted to bathe in ice-cold water. He rolled on
          the cold grass to calm himself. After a minute of agitation, the
          feeling died down slowly.
        </p>
        <p>He lazily opened his eyes and extended his hand towards the sky.</p>
        <p>Swoosh!</p>
        <p>
          A brilliant golden-colored flame emerged from his hand. The flame was
          blazing hot, as if he was holding a piece of the sun. The surroundings
          started to be affected just from its mere presence. The size of the
          flame was not too big, perhaps due to his Level-1 espera, but it still
          felt terrifying. Strangely, he was not affected by the flame at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          He exhaled slightly as he slowly strained his body to stand back up.
          Nadia should also have awakened the Demon Banishing flames by now. So
          before elders or others present noticed his absence, he should get
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon sealing flames that Nadia had awakened were very powerful
          exorcism flames. These flames were highly effective against demons.
          Banishing demons to oblivion was the sole purpose of exorcism, and
          these flames did exactly that. In the novel, it was mentioned that
          during the war, she was directly able to burn battalions of demons to
          ashes with her flames.
        </p>
        <p>He could only imagine how much deadlier his flames would be!</p>
        <p>
          Just as he was about to leave, something else drew his attention once
          again.
        </p>

        <p>[Rank-1 obtained!]</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a rush of espera flooded inside Oliver's body. He felt all
          the nerves inside his body crackling with joy as the sudden influx of
          espera filled them.
        </p>
        <p>
          His entire aura started to transform, more and more espera kept
          filling his insides. His organs, his brain, his bones, nothing was
          left untouched.
        </p>
        <p>He showered in espera.</p>
        <p>Oliver exhaled, the sensation was too relaxing and comforting.</p>
        <p>'So this is how people feel after a breakthrough…'</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but want to indulge in the feeling even more, but
          sadly, it soon stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          He clenched his fist, feeling the force and power behind it. He might
          even be able to punch a hole through a grown tree as he was now.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was not a trace of exhaustion present in his eyes anymore.
          Earlier, he had been drained both physically and mentally in the
          forest after fighting the twins and the demons. But now he felt as
          good as new. His strength was replenished, and his body was
          overflowing with never-before-seen espera.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if he had drunk an elixir.</p>
        <p>
          He calmly looked ahead and viewed his body status. He was sure there
          were going to be significant improvements now.
        </p>
        <p>___________</p>

        <p>[Name: Oliver Mystic]</p>
        <p>[Race: Human]</p>
        <p>[Status: Rank-1]</p>
        <p>[Strength: Level 5]</p>
        <p>[Espera: Level 4]</p>
        <p>[Charisma: Level 3]</p>
        <p>[Luck: Level 2]</p>
        <p>____________</p>
        <p>'That's such a terrifying improvement!'</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but exclaim. His espera level had directly jumped
          from one to four in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could understand this. He directly obtained 10 times the espera
          Nadia had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like a tsunami, espera flooded out of his body, exuding a strong
          pressure.
        </p>
        <p>Crack! Crack!</p>
        <p>His body stretched as he felt energized like never before.</p>
        <p>
          He had long been waiting to awaken a talent for espera, and now it was
          finally there.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia managed to break through and become a Rank-1 exorcist.</p>
        <p>
          Which meant that she had a breakthrough in both her physical strength
          and espera too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stirring of espera directly linked to her talent, the system
          detected it, and he was rewarded with 10x greater talent than her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, now that she was a Rank-1 exorcist, he too became a
          Rank-1 exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          He already had good strength worthy of a Rank-1 exorcist. He could
          have been called a Rank-1 exorcist before just with his physical
          strength, considering he was currently acting as a physical exorcist.
          For exorcists on that path, their strength was the factor that
          determined the ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now he was a full-fledged Rank-1 exorcist after breaking through
          in his espera level and amount as well!
        </p>

        <p>
          Not only that, he had obtained around ten times the espera a genius
          like Nadia would have at Rank-1.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it could be said that he was a Rank-1 exorcist with around ten
          times more espera than normal Rank-1 exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that if he was now faced against the twins once again, he was
          capable enough to handle them both in a minute without using any of
          the secret techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could now also start proper meditations to increase his rank and
          espera amount on his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, due to his poor espera talent, he was not able to gather or
          collect the espera present in his surroundings despite clearly seeing
          them with his special eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, he could suck in all the espera in his surroundings into his
          body with no problem.
        </p>
        <p>It was a great obstacle for him that has now been cleared.</p>
        <p>A lot of possibilities had opened up for him now.</p>
        <p>
          [Ding! Cosmic Void Gaze has cleared the conditions for espera.
          Unlocking Circuit of Abyss]
        </p>
        <p>
          In the very next instant, he felt every ounce of his strength suddenly
          leave his body.
        </p>
        <p>'Huh?'</p>
        <p>He immediately fell to the ground, his body turning immobile…</p>
        <p>
          Not a second later, a terrible pain shot up from his eyes, slowly
          traveling through his entire body, consuming everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt immense pain as he suffered, but he was not even able to
          scream a word.
        </p>
        <p>'Agh! My eyes! SO PAINFUL!' He screamed internally.</p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          Dark clouds instantly gathered in the sky, covering the entirety of
          the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>____________</p>
        <p>"Meow?"</p>
        <p>
          In his courtyard, the fat clan guardian, who was just chomping on a
          fish that Oliver had left behind, suddenly jolted.
        </p>
        <p>
          She furiously turned her head around and almost blinked out toward the
          courtyard, her speed tremendous.
        </p>

        <p>
          She gravely looked at the pitch-black clouds, giving an ominous
          feeling. Her hair stood to no end as she looked at those ominous
          clouds.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Thump! Thump!</p>
        <p>
          Her heart started to thump wildly as she observed the clouds of void.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were not normal thunderclouds… she knew it. She was sure of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her expression was grave and serious as she observed the pitch-black
          cloudy atmosphere that enveloped the entire clan all of a sudden.
        </p>
        <p>She could sense the element of void present all around.</p>
        <p>
          One of the most terrifying elements in existence. It was one of the
          primordial elements and was extremely rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          But right now, the entire clan was covered in a blanket of this
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes turned sharp as she tried to see through the blanket of
          clouds but found it impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not as strong as she used to be. She could not pierce through
          it. It was as if all her senses had been absorbed by the clouds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sky was so eerie that she could not help but shudder. It was as if
          the clouds had devoured the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          She remembered this ominous feeling… it was the same when she had
          first found out about the boy.
        </p>
        <p>'What an unpleasant feeling...'</p>
        <p>
          Her heart sank when she realized that something was going on with that
          boy in the trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without wasting a second, she disappeared from her spot. If she was
          late, then who knows what would happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had spent a lot of time with Oliver and knew that he was not a bad
          kid, he was kind and was obedient, although he would occasionally put
          things in her food, he was a normal child.
        </p>
        <p>She did not what had happened for the sky to turn like this.</p>
        <p>
          She knew if something or someone interfered wrongly, the entire clan
          could suffer.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phenomenon was too big and too terrifying. It would inevitably
          draw the attention of many, not just in the clan but outside too.
        </p>
        <p>Not to mention, the Death Witch was also present in the clan.</p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian could not help but want to curse. She shouldn't have
          allowed him to participate in the demon hunt.
        </p>
        <p>Things were about to get troublesome.</p>
        <p>The cat groaned as a headache came to her.</p>
        <p>"Meow…"</p>
        <p>
          If the cloud started to rain, then the clan would suffer irreversible
          damage.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were the void clouds, not some normal clouds they could easily
          remove.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 86: Circuit of Abyss!</h2>
        <p>Oliver was still suffering while the cat was searching for him.</p>
        <p>
          His body twitched and convulsed from time to time. His expression,
          however, was neutral; his facial muscles were stiff—refusing to even
          move.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if someone was performing surgery on every piece of his body
          while he was conscious and alive without any anesthetics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only bear the pain as his very nerves and tissues were
          bearing severe pain, but he told himself to endure it as it was for
          his own good.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sinking feeling appeared in his mind; it was as if he was slowly
          sinking into darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked around himself, but all he could feel and see was void. His
          mind and body were connected with the Abyss now… he was drowning in
          the very depths of the Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just for a very short instance, he felt as if he saw the worst
          monstrosities in existence as he kept sinking…
        </p>
        <p>
          His body trembled just gazing at them for less than a second, his
          heart felt cold…
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if something was changing within his body, mind, and heart
          as he kept sinking…
        </p>
        <p>
          He dared not imagine just how monstrous those terrifying beings could
          be…
        </p>
        <p>
          Those monsters were definitely beyond the scope of humans or demons
          alike. They were true Evil!
        </p>
        <p>
          Just their existence alone was a corruption to the universe. He felt
          that way as he continued sinking… yet for some strange reason, he was
          starting to feel a familiar feeling welling inside him.
        </p>
        <p>Was he getting corrupted too?</p>
        <p>He did not know, and all he could do was just wait and wait…</p>

        <p>His body kept reforming, becoming a true circuit of the abyss!</p>

        <p>
          While Oliver was unconscious, there was a great turmoil happening in
          various places.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first place being the chamber where the head judge and others were
          waiting for Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had been there as Nadia was awakening new powers and doing a
          breakthrough to Rank-1.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elders and the head judge were quite impressed and shocked by her
          progressing speed.
        </p>
        <p>She was only 7 years old and was already a Rank-1 Exorcist!</p>
        <p>They did not reach the realm of Rank-1 until their twenties!</p>
        <p>It could be seen how much of a monster she was.</p>
        <p>She was probably one of the youngest ever to reach Rank-1.</p>
        <p>
          And not only that, her espera was quite strong; she was born with
          great espera talent, so it was natural she was way above other
          geniuses.
        </p>
        <p>Among her siblings, she definitely had the greatest talent.</p>
        <p>They all wanted her as a disciple, but alas, she was 'special.'</p>

        <p>At that moment, all of them suddenly shuddered.</p>
        <p>
          The head judge frowned as he felt goosebumps over his skin; he
          instantly disappeared from his spot, appearing outside the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>His eyes gradually widened as his blood ran cold…</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the sky, and it was pitch black; he could feel a
          tremendous amount of Void element in the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hands shook as he imagined these clouds raining; the rain would
          contain properties of Void, an element that was known as the second
          name of destruction!
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt an immense sense of dread and frantically covered the chamber
          with his espera, quickly forming a protective barrier over it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miss Nadia was still inside going through her breakthrough, and at
          this moment, she must not be disturbed at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          He immediately contacted the elders, and they were all equally
          surprised by the sudden phenomenon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some even suspected the demons had launched a large-scale attack
          specifically targeting the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head judge was also a normal elder, so he could only listen
          helplessly as he heard his superiors forming theories.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were not in contact with the Patriarch at the moment since he was
          away for some work.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Calm down, activate the barrier formation first. We will decide our
          next course of action properly."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ask Sir Kyle to lead a team of exorcists and inspect every corner of
          the clan and apprehend anyone they suspect who might be associated
          with the phenomenon or demon."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, elder!" One of the elders on the other side of the communication
          device quickly obeyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another elder chimed in as she said, "I believe it's not related to
          demons. With the level of security we have, only a catastrophe-level
          demon would dare to enter this place."
        </p>
        <p>Hearing her, others also nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "She's right, even a catastrophic class demon would be hesitant to
          enter; this place filled with the best exorcists could easily threaten
          its life. I think we should investigate it more deeply."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm, now that I remember, some years ago, didn't something this
          ominous happen too? At that time, the respected guardian of the clan
          went personally to solve it, I did not hear anything about it from her
          afterwards."
        </p>
        <p>"Neither did I… what could have happened?"</p>
        <p>
          "I believe we should directly ask the clan guardian about this!"
          someone suggested.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 87: She noticed! Impending threat?</h2>
        <p>
          "This seems related to that incident… Can we contact the clan guardian
          and ask for her pointers on this situation? While I respect her
          decision, she might have her own circumstances for not informing us,
          but now that it has come to the safety of the whole clan, I suggest we
          ask her straight."
        </p>
        <p>"You're right." Some of them agreed.</p>
        <p>
          As for the thought that the clan guardian might be colluding with
          demons to harm them?
        </p>
        <p>
          It did not even cross their minds; the clan guardian had been there
          since the founding. She had devoted her entire being to the clan.
        </p>
        <p>Centuries of loyalty was not something that could be doubted.</p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, she was a spiritual entity, and demons were something
          she hated.
        </p>
        <p>Not only that, even the patriarch respected her.</p>
        <p>
          They wouldn't dare to doubt her. Not only was she older than them, but
          her powers were also not widely known.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will try to contact her." The female elder nodded and informed the
          others.
        </p>
        <p>They quickly coordinated and divided the tasks among themselves.</p>
        <p>
          At this moment, they quickly came to a decision and activated the clan
          barrier using the array formation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if the clouds were still and unmoving, no one dared to be
          careless.
        </p>
        <p>
          This level of phenomenon could cause widespread destruction. Even a
          single drop of void could directly destroy a fertile land forever.
        </p>
        <p>_____________</p>
        <p>
          In another place, a woman dressed in a flower-patterned white kimono
          was sitting in a courtyard under an umbrella.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes were a beautiful shade of silver, and her face was nothing
          but a piece of art.
        </p>

        <p>
          She was also looking at the pitch-black sky; however, her expression
          was calm and unmoving, unlike the other elders.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if she was not affected by it at all. There was not an ounce
          of fear or tension on her beautiful face.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was on her face was extreme coldness. An aura of death filled her
          surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          She calmly observed the clouds, her eyes shining with a mysterious
          light.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if she could see through the clouds and beyond what even the
          clan guardian was unable to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes moved and looked in the direction where Oliver and the other
          children were.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if she could directly see what was happening there.</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes flickered for a moment as if she saw something unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>"Interesting… did I calculate it wrong?"</p>
        <p>
          She asked to no one in particular. Although her voice was gentle and
          honey-like, her tone was chilling cold and grave.
        </p>
        <p>She slowly got up and picked up her umbrella.</p>
        <p>
          Her body slowly turned into countless fine particles as she slowly
          disappeared from her spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes had a certain glint to them as she kept looking towards the
          place where Oliver and others were.
        </p>
        <p>_________________</p>
        <p>
          The head judge had a headache as he looked at the unmoving clouds, his
          senses felt suffocated due to the presence of Void.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was calmly guarding the chambers while he informed the other elders
          inside to be with the children and not let them out.
        </p>
        <p>
          If any of them got hurt, he would not be able to show his face to
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were the cream of the crop, the best among the best. They had a
          huge potential that had to be polished. Even if he perished today, he
          must ensure their safety.
        </p>

        <p>Those three were too precious to be left unguarded.</p>
        <p>Three?</p>
        <p>
          The head judge froze. He suddenly remembered that Oliver was also in
          the three he counted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, due to the sudden phenomenon and the elder's call, he forgot
          about the fact that earlier Oliver was not there when he looked
          around.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time, he was more focused on Nadia due to her breakthrough and
          thought he might have gone to freshen up or something.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he was still not there when the clouds suddenly appeared outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned heavily. If something happened, then the responsibility
          would fall on his shoulders for not taking extra steps to maintain
          their safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to go and search around, but he was afraid that if something
          were to happen with the ominous void clouds above, he might not be
          able to protect this chamber behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only wait for reinforcements now as he quickly sent a short
          message to his subordinates to reach where he was.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered if the others were able to get in contact with the clan
          guardian or not?
        </p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian, meanwhile, had already sensed the situation. She
          sped through the corridors, her feline form a blur of motion. The
          atmosphere grew heavier with each passing second as she neared the
          source of the disturbance.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was keenly aware of the chambers where the rewards were supposed
          to be distributed.
        </p>
        <p>He and others should be there by now.</p>
        <p>
          Her heart pounded as she remembered the boy—Oliver. The strange
          phenomenon that surrounded him seemed to be repeating itself, only
          this time it was far more intense.
        </p>
        <p>Far more intense.</p>
        <p>
          She instantly reached the chambers and looked around. She could see an
          old man guarding the chambers, but Oliver was not inside when she
          sensed in.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her senses expanded, covering more of the area before she quickly
          located him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She found him lying on the ground, his body convulsing and eyes shut
          tight. The pitch-black clouds swirling above were an ominous sign.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oliver!" she hissed, trying to rouse him from his state. She could
          feel the void energy seeping into him, changing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she tried to sense his condition, the void clouds began to stir
          ominously, crackling with latent power. She knew that if she did not
          act quickly, the entire clan could be in grave danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He needs to be stabilized," she muttered, focusing her own powers to
          create a protective barrier around him.
        </p>
        <p>She channeled her espera, hoping to contain the void's influence.</p>
        <p>
          As she did this, the void clouds trembled as if they would rain at any
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The onlookers could not help but shudder, feeling the ominous aura
          above them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A feeling of dread was present inside the hearts of every person at
          this moment.
        </p>
        <p>The only sense of relief was the clan barrier over their heads.</p>
        <p>
          The oblivious ones who could not feel the true nature of the threat
          merely considered the clouds as thunderclouds that were darker than
          usual and continued with their lives as usual.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, those with heightened senses knew better. They watched the
          clouds with bated breath, knowing that the slightest disturbance could
          unleash untold destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the clan guardian poured her power into stabilizing Oliver, she
          could feel the void energy resisting her efforts. It was as if the
          very essence of the void was alive, pushing back against her control.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hold on, Oliver," she whispered, her voice filled with determination.
          "You must endure this."
        </p>
        <p>
          She was aware that if Oliver didn't wake up in time, it might be too
          late. At that time, she might have to take the extreme measures which
          she absolutely wanted to avoid no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's convulsions began to slow, his body gradually calming as the
          void energy was contained. The clouds above started to dissipate,
          their ominous presence fading slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He's gaining control,' she looked at him, 'it's finally happening.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, after what felt like an eternity, Oliver lay still, the void
          energy contained within him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian sighed in relief, her body sagging with exhaustion.
          "It's over, for now."
        </p>
        <p>
          But even as she said those words, she knew that this was only a
          temporary reprieve. The power within Oliver was something
          unprecedented, and they would need to be vigilant in the days to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He needs to learn to control this or else, in the future, I cannot
          imagine what might happen...'
        </p>
        <p>
          She was serious when she thought about it.&nbsp;For now, she was glad
          that the cloud were slowly fading too.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she walked around his unconscious body, she couldn't shake the
          feeling that this was just the beginning of something far greater and
          more dangerous.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 88: He is awake</h2>
        <p>
          Oliver was still in his mindscape, he was experiencing the vagueness
          of being in Abyss but he was unable to clearly feel anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would shudder from time to time whenever a monster-like entity
          would be seen by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Creatures with shadowy hair as thick as leather, otherworldly faces
          bulging from the skin, and horrifying specifics that he was unable to
          see in the void.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he kept falling more and more, the creatures became more and more
          menacing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly as if something clicked, he felt an even deeper sense of
          connection with the Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt his body anew, as if he was now in a different body, he could
          feel power rushing from every corner of his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unknown knowledge about many things suddenly rushed into his mind, he
          was unable to comprehended some while other pieces of the information
          were just as equally complex or disturbing in nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information regarding his new self entered his mind, it seemed that he
          had become a creature of Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>Or something more…</p>
        <p>He was unable to tell.</p>
        <p>
          The abyss energy, he could feel it inside his veins… flowing naturally
          as blood.
        </p>
        <p>He was unable to understand many things but he felt himself calm.</p>
        <p>
          It was an eerie calm, as if he was not much affected by things
          happening around him.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver….</p>
        <p>Oliver.</p>
        <p>Oliver.</p>

        <p>"OLIVER!"</p>
        <p>
          He started hearing his name being called out, slowly drawing him out
          of the void.
        </p>
        <p>"Umm…"</p>
        <p>
          He groaned slightly confused, slowly opening his eyes, there was no
          pain in his body anymore.
        </p>
        <p>A bright light assaulted his eyes as he slowly opened them.</p>
        <p>'Beautiful…'</p>
        <p>
          He said looking at the black sky, well, not exactly the void clouds
          but the countless colorful particles floating in the atmosphere all
          around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those were the espera particles, he could clearly see them, more
          defined and more detailed.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the different colored particles, he could tell their attributes
          and other stuff, he could define the particles even better than
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, he felt the surroundings also felt more detailed than
          usual.
        </p>
        <p>"Oliver-!"</p>
        <p>
          He heard a feminine sound and slowly got up and sat down, he looked
          around but found no one.
        </p>
        <p>Who called his name just now?</p>
        <p>Tug.</p>
        <p>
          Feeling a tug on his clothes, he looked below to see a pristine white
          cat.
        </p>
        <p>"Zippy…?"</p>
        <p>He picked her up slowly and looked her seriously in the eyes.</p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian also looked back into his eyes but was momentarily
          stunned, his eyes… seemed to have changed for some reason.
        </p>

        <p>She could feel a deepness into them.</p>
        <p>
          Eyes were the windows to one's soul and could tell a lot about the
          person.
        </p>
        <p>
          For an expert like her who could even read fate and future from the
          stars, she was naturally able to feel the immense deepness in his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>'Something had definitely changed in him.'</p>
        <p>
          She thought with a pondering look, for some reason, she felt an
          invisible pressure as she continued to look into his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Those eyes felt dark… for some reason.</p>
        <p>
          She had fought countless demons in her lifetime, and knew what was
          dread.
        </p>
        <p>She could feel an evil presence inside him… an inherent evilness.</p>
        <p>
          'No, this shouldn't be the case? Why am I feeling this?' She shook her
          head.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inherent evil aura that she was thinking of was something that was
          present in the most gruesome and fearsome entities of the world. It
          was not something that could be present in a child.
        </p>
        <p>Especially considering he was a kind-hearted boy to begin with.</p>
        <p>
          She was unable to pinpoint what was causing it and what exactly was it
          but she knew it had something to do with the phenomenon above and his
          mysterious power from before.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did you just speak now?" Oliver looked at the clan guardian
          curiously.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that the clan guardian forgot that currently she was acting as
          his pet—a normal pet!
        </p>
        <p>"Meow?" she shook her head and replied.</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>'You are shaking your head, this means you understand me, right?'</p>

        <p>
          He could tell that the clan guardian was quite stupid at acting and
          her skills were below average so he did not mind her and just patted
          her head.
        </p>
        <p>"How can that be?" he said. "I must have misunderstood."</p>
        <p>The cat also glanced at his body and was momentarily stunned.</p>
        <p>'He's already Rank-1?' she was shocked.</p>
        <p>
          'What's with this ridiculous amount of espera,' she found it hard to
          believe, 'this is definitely not the espera level of a Rank-1.'
        </p>
        <p>
          She could obviously feel the espera radiating out of Oliver's body, he
          had broke through Rank-1 for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>'But how…!?'</p>
        <p>
          He was a normal talentless boy with barely any espera and now suddenly
          he not only had abundant espera but also way more espera than any
          genius she had seen so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be hard to believe that this kid was the same kid who had
          barely any espera just a day ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone sensed through him, they would feel he was nothing but a
          genius among geniuses.
        </p>
        <p>He put her down as he slowly got up.</p>
        <p>
          He knew things were not simple looking at those fading clouds filled
          with those hollow particles.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for the clan guardian to come here, he must be the cause of this.
        </p>
        <p>'It seems she has helped me this time.'</p>
        <p>
          He placed his hand over his chest as he felt the tremendous abyssal
          energy flowing inside him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And looking over at her, he felt that she was not able to sense this.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the novel, there was never been the mention of the Abyss or Abyssal
          energy so he was able to conclude that she was not aware of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though this was a complete mystery, he did not intend to tell her
          about it. He doubted that she had any clues about it either.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew things were about to turn troublesome, with all the
          disturbances and Nadia and other girl in the chamber with the elders,
          reinforcements should be arriving soon.
        </p>
        <p>They might also be searching for him.</p>
        <p>
          He looked at himself, he was drenched in sweat and his espera was
          leaking out.
        </p>
        <p>He frowned, he could not go out like this.</p>
        <p>
          If he suddenly showed espera ten times greater than Nadia, the clan
          genius, he would directly be sent to a laboratory where a group of
          people in white coat would operate on him.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Chapter 89: Using Abyss Energy for the first time! Did she see it?
        </h2>
        <p>
          If Oliver went out with his new Rank-1 status, the clan would not let
          him leave without getting information out of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt the espera running through him, a warm, pulsating energy that
          seemed to resonate with his very core.
        </p>
        <p>
          He fell into thought about how he could hide his espera or somehow
          suppress it to not be on the level of Rank-1.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was fine to reveal that he had a good amount of espera, but
          suddenly showing himself as Rank-1 would be too reckless.
        </p>
        <p>
          And also dangerous… The clan might see him as a threat or a pawn to be
          used, neither of which he could afford.
        </p>
        <p>'Hmm…'</p>
        <p>
          He calmly thought about various things. He remembered how the clan
          guardian had no reaction to the Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>'Abyss energy is closely related to the void element…'</p>
        <p>
          He looked up at the fading pitch-black clouds with a knowing glance.
        </p>
        <p>
          A normal exorcist would find their senses blocked due to the presence
          of the void element.
        </p>
        <p>'I should try doing that…'</p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian observed him from the side. She suddenly saw him
          looking at the void clouds, and afterward, he did something
          unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>
          He started to suppress his espera by drawing in all the espera that
          was being released from his body back into himself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her eyes widened as she saw that the espera slowly entering his body
          was suddenly disappearing…
        </p>
        <p>
          No, disappearing would be the wrong word. Espera cannot disappear like
          that; he was blocking her probing through some means.
        </p>
        <p>
          She realized he was either employing an advanced technique, or
          something beyond ordinary suppression.
        </p>
        <p>
          She increased her force to look into him, but the results remained the
          same. It was as if he had a wall inside him and all the espera was on
          the other side of the wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was only able to sense the bits and pieces of espera left outside
          the wall, or the amount he most probably left outside for others to
          feel intentionally in order to cheat his rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, she felt that he was no longer a Rank-1 exorcist but
          instead had slightly above-average espera like others.
        </p>
        <p>'What did he do?' she wondered.</p>
        <p>
          She felt that he was definitely not using an espera-suppressing
          technique or another concealing technique; it would not have been able
          to escape her brute force.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was using something else, and given the earlier phenomenon, she was
          sure that it had something to do with the void element.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should be the reason why her senses were unable to breach it.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt that this guy was really clever. She had some thoughts about
          hiding his unnatural espera using artifacts or something, but it
          seemed unnecessary for her to worry about it in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was really curious about his abilities after breaking through to
          Rank-1… What other secrets could he be hiding?
        </p>
        <p>
          She fell into thought, it seemed that she would need to arrange
          something to know more details.
        </p>
        <p>
          'It might be a risky move but if it works, not only will I get an
          overview but also provide him an opportunity to get stronger…'
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver, who used the Abyss energy to coat the espera overflowing from
          his body, was satisfied when he felt his espera reduced to almost an
          average level.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would still be a shock to others that he was able to have a boost
          in espera given his low talent, but it was still somewhat digestible.
        </p>
        <p>
          After completely covering himself with Abyss energy, he was sure that
          he had successfully concealed every bit of his leaking espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he thought about it, he found that there were many things he was
          now able to do thanks to the unknown knowledge he received.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the cat, who was staring at him with her big eyes and
          blank expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded; it was no problem if the clan guardian came to know about
          it. She was already aware of many things and was also aware of his
          earlier breakthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was also grateful to her since she arrived in time and rescued him.
          He secretly made a mental note to feed her expensive meat and fish
          after going back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their bond, forged through shared secrets and mutual respect, had
          grown stronger somewhat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both did not know the other's true intention but still went through
          together.
        </p>
        <p>His trust in her increased by some points.</p>
        <p>
          He said as he patted her tiny head, "I am now going to the chamber
          ahead. You go back, Zippy."
        </p>
        <p>
          After he said this, he directly left without looking back. He didn't
          care if she followed him or not. It was not like he could force her to
          stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the bushes, he was able to see the head-judge standing guard,
          continuously observing the sky with a relaxed expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed that he was quite stressed out due to the sudden phenomenon,
          and now that the clouds were slowly fading away, he was more than
          relieved and seemed delighted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver noted the shift, wondering how much the head-judge truly
          understood about what had just happened. Did he know about the cause
          or what were his speculations about this incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and slowly went up to the elder who was engrossed in
          his own world.
        </p>
        <p>
          He moved to the side and passed by the elder, who was busy staring at
          the clouds.
        </p>
        <p>Creak!</p>
        <p>
          Opening the door slowly, he entered the chambers. The head-judge
          seemed to be extremely busy looking at the sky and did not even notice
          him passing by his side.
        </p>
        <p>Or did he?</p>
        <p>
          It was not that the head-judge was not paying attention; instead, his
          senses were all around, and he was on guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, the void clouds had blocked his senses, and now that they
          were fading, his senses were quickly getting restored as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this was happening, Oliver happened to coat himself with the
          Abyss energy earlier, which made his presence close to nil.
        </p>
        <p>
          If not for the little bit of espera that he was emitting from his
          body, he might have truly turned invisible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to these circumstances, Oliver easily avoided being detected by
          the elder.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he entered the chambers, he saw others present as well, and they
          also looked at him entering…
        </p>
        <p>
          The few lower-ranking elders did not ask him much as he quickly stood
          to the side. They all assumed that the head-judge must have let him in
          after discussing the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver also saw that Nadia was still meditating in the corner. She was
          stabilizing her espera after the breakthrough to Rank-1 earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          He admired her focus and discipline, she was indeed the most talented
          in the clan. To be able to break through at such a tender age…
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, she also opened her eyes and looked around before her
          eyes landed on Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes narrowed; for some reason, in her eyes, he seemed filled with
          some sort of familiar aura, a blanket of sorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          She blinked a few times and confirmed that she was not seeing things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but the aura seemed overflowing and dreading, but to
          her, it gave off a familiar feeling. She wracked her brain, trying to
          recall where she had sensed such an aura before.
        </p>
        <p>What was it?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 90: Ophelia! She's here!</h2>
        <p>
          Oliver heard a commotion outside followed by multiple footsteps and
          tremors.
        </p>
        <p>The head-judge entered the chambers after a moment.</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the children and heaved a sigh of relief. Fortunately,
          everything was fine.
        </p>
        <p>"Reinforcements are here, we are now going to look for Olive—"</p>
        <p>
          He trailed off as he looked at the silver-haired boy who was standing
          with a nonchalant expression.
        </p>
        <p>"You!" the head-judge was stunned. "How did you get here?"</p>
        <p>"Me?" Oliver pointed at himself. "I just got here."</p>
        <p>
          "What? How's that possible? I had been guarding outside…" He stopped
          in the middle of his sentence&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          A sudden gust of wind blew through, causing some leaves outside to
          flutter.
        </p>
        <p>
          He paused for a moment. Now that he thought about it, he was too
          engrossed in the void clouds to be on guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was probably then that he sneaked past him. He was too careless.
        </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he let the matter rest for now.</p>
        <p>
          He glanced at Violet, the girl who placed third, and called out to
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Miss Violet, your family butler has come to pick you up. It seems
          your family is worried about you given the situation outside. You
          should leave; if there's anything, we'll let you know."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, elder." The girl bowed and quickly left.</p>
        <p>
          Now only Oliver and Nadia were left in the chambers along with two
          elders.
        </p>

        <p>
          The head-judge glanced at the two elders and said, "We're currently
          investigating the cause of the earlier phenomenon. You should go and
          help out with the investigation. There are soon going to be inquiries
          from other clans. The phenomenon was just that big, so you will
          probably be assigned to deal with them."
        </p>
        <p>The two elders nodded and quickly dispersed as well.</p>
        <p>The head-judge sighed and looked at the two kids left.</p>
        <p>
          He observed and felt that they were indeed twins. They were very
          identical; if not for their gender, they might be impossible to
          differentiate between.
        </p>
        <p>He smiled, "Today has been quite the day, no?"</p>
        <p>"Was it?" Oliver spoke as if he didn't know anything.</p>
        <p>
          The elder's lips could not help but twitch. This brat dared to look
          oblivious when he had just returned from outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Forget it. I will drop you two at your courtyards. There might be
          intruders in the clan, so I suggest that you both don't wander around
          too much until an announcement is made. There will be increased
          security near your residences too."
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned around and dispersed the reinforcements as well. Now that
          Oliver was here, there was no need to look around.
        </p>
        <p>"Good, now follow m—"</p>
        <p>
          At that moment, the three of them suddenly felt a terrifying pressure
          on their shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver and Nadia could not help but shiver. An aura of death suddenly
          filled the air.
        </p>
        <p>Thud!&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
          The weight of the pressure felt like an invisible hammer striking
          their bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The atmosphere turned suffocating instantly, as if someone was holding
          a sword just before their necks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia, who had been expressionless, suddenly showed a great change in
          her expression as she quickly recognized the familiar espera around.
        </p>
        <p>"Mother..." she whispered in a strained tone.</p>

        <p>
          For some reason, she had a bad feeling in her heart. She looked at
          Oliver at her side and her heart shrank more.
        </p>
        <p>
          She forced herself to calm down. Her heart was beating like a drum and
          she felt her blood run cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, her mother would not know about her meetings with Oliver. It must
          be due to the phenomenon outside that the elder was talking about that
          she came here.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew that her mother would ensure her safety no matter what. It
          was impossible for anyone in the clan to harm her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mother had said to her that she was the greatest weapon the clan
          had produced in generations and that she was going to sharpen her and
          make her the strongest.
        </p>
        <p>The strongest ever, no matter what.</p>
        <p>
          The head-judge, who felt this terrifying pressure on himself, felt
          himself losing his bearings. This pressure was as huge as a mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was quite a strong exorcist, but even he was feeling stressed under
          this terrifying pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that this sort of pressure and espera was only exerted by a
          select few in the entire clan.
        </p>
        <p>The ones sitting in the supreme positions.</p>
        <p>He quickly went down on one knee and bowed.</p>
        <p>Someone from the main lineage had arrived here.</p>
        <p>Tap Tap Tap</p>
        <p>
          The tapping of heels against the wooden floor was heard as a woman
          slowly entered the chambers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her figure was ethereal and her movements were extremely graceful.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had long silver hair and ashen gray eyes. In one hand, she was
          holding a pale-colored paper umbrella and was dressed in a plain
          flower-patterned kimono.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, who was also feeling the suffocation, saw her and his scalp
          went numb.
        </p>

        <p>Ophelia!</p>
        <p>Why was she here?</p>
        <p>
          He instantly connected the dots. The earlier phenomenon—it was caused
          by him.
        </p>
        <p>Did she know of it too?</p>
        <p>
          He felt his heart clench at that thought. If Ophelia knew about it and
          realized that he was not useless anymore,
        </p>
        <p>She would definitely not leave him alone.</p>
        <p>
          In the first place, he did not even know why he was left alive at
          birth when they found him useless. That was something he could not
          guess at all. There had to be a reason; he was sure of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But forget about that. Now that he displayed a good show to the crowd,
          ranking second in the demon hunt, his strength was already revealed.
        </p>
        <p>If she were to probe him now, she would realize many things.</p>
        <p>He did not know what she would do then.</p>
        <p>
          Ophelia ignored the kneeling elder, who did not even dare to look up
          at her, and walked toward him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia saw this and her fist unconsciously clenched. She didn't know
          why her mother was coming his way rather than to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to go between them but felt her feet frozen on the spot.
        </p>
        <p>She was… scared.</p>
        <p>
          It was an instinctual reaction. Whenever she was in her mother's
          presence, she had to be the best version of herself.
        </p>
        <p>She must always be obedient and never question her decisions.</p>
        <p>She must accept everything.</p>
        <p>
          So far, she had never felt anything about it. As long as she followed
          whatever her mother said, she would one day gain her recognition and
          praise. And also become stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she did not know why, but her mind and heart were rebelling at the
          moment. For the first time, she did not want to just stand and
          observe.
        </p>
        <p>
          She slowly glanced at Oliver, whose eyes were also fixed on her
          mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her, he could see her emotionless eyes, the same eyes
          he had seen for the first time when he came into this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was not a single change in them, as cold as ever, not a single
          emotion or change inside them.
        </p>
        <p>Those eyes gave him a feeling of dread for some reason.</p>
