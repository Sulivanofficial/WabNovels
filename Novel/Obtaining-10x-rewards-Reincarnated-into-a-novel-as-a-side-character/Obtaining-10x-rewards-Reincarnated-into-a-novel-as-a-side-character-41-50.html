        <h2>Chapter 41: Nadia's mindset... what's a sibling?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 41</p>
        <p>Yet she felt angry now that Oliver was in front of her...</p>
        <p>And her reason for anger?</p>
        <p>
          Was it really due to the fact that she thought he was looking down on
          her by giving her another precious medicine or elixir?
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it due to the fact that he had ignored her previous warnings to
          not come here again and he ignored her and came again that made her
          feel he did not take her seriously?
        </p>
        <p>Or...</p>
        <p>
          Was it that she was angry because if he kept on coming here again and
          again, their mother would find out...?
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it that she was angry because he kept giving her those precious
          potions, elixirs, and whatnot instead of using them himself, for his
          own strength?
        </p>
        <p>
          Why... just when she would feel she has finally become what her mother
          expected of her, she would again come at the starting point.
        </p>
        <p>It always was because of him...</p>
        <p>Did she feel angry because of this?</p>
        <p>
          She did not know... she was supposed to be the vessel for being the
          best exorcist, yet she could not even control herself.
        </p>

        <p>"Leave..."</p>
        <p>
          She did not want to be in his presence anymore, or she would just feel
          pressured.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could still remember how she had cried in front of him so
          shamefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was silent as he saw her complicated expression; he was not a
          fool and understood her condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to help her, but knowing his own lack of strength and his
          mother's strong ambitions, he chose to remain silent for the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, he was not sure how the plot would change; he had already made
          many changes, and he was sure that Nadia would definitely grow
          stronger than she was in the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and felt her trouble; he also wanted to get her
          stronger as he could also rely on her and become stronger quicker.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she wouldn't just take his help for reasons he was not sure about.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Will you really not take it? I had to go through many troubles just
          to acquire this."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver asked her in a small tone; he wanted her to know that this
          thing was not ordinary and could boost her strength significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia raised her head and looked at the syringe containing the
          seaweed-green liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew nothing of it; she had not yet read about this medicine or
          elixir or whatever miraculous it was supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, a desire rose in her heart, the desire to take it and
          become stronger so she could stand proud in front of her mother and
          earn her praise more.
        </p>
        <p>But she suppressed herself and decided not to accept it.</p>

        <p>
          She had no doubt that if it was something that great, then her clan
          would provide her with it someday when her mother deemed her worthy
          for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would not accept another favor from him; it felt embarrassing to
          her. She hadn't even made it equal to him after the body-strengthening
          elixir she had received from him last time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although she knew that she was definitely not inferior to him in terms
          of strength, she knew if she took things from him like this, then
          sooner or later, she might feel the opposite way due to her pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not question him either on how he got his hands on such items.
          If possible, she wanted minimal interactions with him and know less of
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, she might not be able to contain the budding curiosity in
          her heart about him.
        </p>
        <p>"Fine. If that's how you want to be."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was too lazy to force her either; not to mention, he also
          didn't like being treated like this again and again. Every time he met
          her, she would always want him to leave and not come back.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew of her circumstances a little, but even so, being told 'no'
          repeatedly made him annoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He always told himself that he was mature and did this for the
          benefits of both of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at her once again, seeing her straight face, he knew that
          she was suppressing herself, he was never the best when dealing with
          people emotionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was also not a protagonist who could understand others feeling with
          a glance and a few words from him would directly make the female lead
          bring out of depression.
        </p>
        <p>He was just a side-character.</p>
        <p>
          He sighed, "Anyways, you don't need to feel embarrassed in receiving
          things from me in the future. We are twins; I am your brother, and
          this is not a favor that I'm doing for you, but rather treat them as a
          gift from me to help you improve faster. There are no favors done
          here; this is how a normal sibling relationship works."
        </p>
        <p>
          He further said, "Remember, there are no favors done between us; if
          you ever need help, you can always visit me. Well, I might be sounding
          ridiculous considering my meager strength, but trust me, not
          everything is solved by brute force."
        </p>

        <p>"Also, I am a very intelligent kid as my tutors say so..."</p>
        <p>
          Finally, he put the syringe back into his pocket as he left, "I'll
          leave for now. Think about it with a calm mind; you should be able to
          come to a conclusion. I'll visit some other time."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, Oliver left under her somewhat shocked gaze. Although he
          had not succeeded in giving her the essence this time, he believed he
          had given a valuable lesson that might help her understand others more
          in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt bitter about going through so much trouble only to be
          rejected, but he understood that this was life, the protagonist would
          give stuff to female lead and she would always accept?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ridiculous, those female leads were just poorly brought out with no
          personality of their own.
        </p>
        <p>___________</p>
        <p>
          Nadia saw him silently leaving; his earlier words were still ringing
          in her ears.
        </p>
        <p>No favors. Only gifts?</p>
        <p>
          She had never thought of it this way; her mother had always taught her
          that she should never owe others no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the heiress of the Mystic Purge Clan, she could not fall so low as
          to accept others' favors as it would only tarnish her image in front
          of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          So why did she feel such a strong emotion when he mentioned that there
          were no favors done between them? Her chest felt warm, and her eyes
          were fuzzy; overall, it was a comfortable feeling that she never
          experienced in her cold life.
        </p>
        <p>Normal sibling relationship...</p>
        <p>
          She looked at the gates of her courtyard from where he had left and
          could not help but wonder if this was how twins behaved?
        </p>
        <p>
          Was this the feeling of being normal? Was it right for someone
          belonging to the Mystic Purge clan to be normal?
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it normal for siblings to help each other like this? Did normal
          siblings really have no favors between them but just gifts? She didn't
          know.
        </p>
        <p>But she felt that he might be right...</p>
        <p>
          She should focus on her growth and become stronger to find out if he
          was really right or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          She touched her heart to feel it beating fast; she felt comfortable
          and wanted to remember this feeling if possible.
        </p>
        <p>A sibling... what was it?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 42: Unlocking a new element!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 42</p>
        <p>
          Oliver activated the [Wrap of Quantum Darkness] and turned invisible
          to leave the central area.
        </p>
        <p>
          He soon heard a commotion as he neared the exit gates; he looked over
          only to see the guards panicking.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sir! The situation seems to be getting out of control... the guards
          are losing control and engaging... uh among themselves."
        </p>
        <p>
          "They have gone insane. I will have to increase their training by
          twice. Such low self-control!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I believe the preparator has mixed concentrated aphrodisiac in the
          smoke and before the team could realize what was happening, they had
          already inhaled it resulting in this."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The preparator must have an ulterior motive, I suppose. There's no
          way anyone would pull out such a prank on the guards."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Go inside the central area, I have obtained elder's permit and see if
          there are any suspicious individuals inside while we handle the
          restless guards, subdue them for the time being."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, who heard everything, felt awkward; they were indeed talking
          about him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but feel pity for the guards who inhaled the potent
          aphrodisiac enough to make elephants go wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had not intended to be so excessive, but he didn't want them to not
          be affected at all; he was not sure if their strength could help them
          evade the effects of the drug, so he put a huge amount of it inside
          the smoke capsule.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, he finally had his answer.</p>
        <p>
          Shaking his head slightly, he quickly left the area, leaving the
          guards oblivious.
        </p>

        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>
          In the end, he heard from the maids that since there was nothing
          suspicious found, the guards were forced to believe that all of this
          was just a prank by someone shady.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although they have announced to investigate properly and apprehend the
          person responsible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had no worries; he had ensured that they would not be able to
          trace back to him unless they spent a lot of resources, and he doubted
          they would go so far for something they thought was a prank.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he didn't have anything to worry about for the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the white cat with a bulging belly sleeping like a log
          and felt speechless.
        </p>
        <p>The clan guardian was so un-guardian-like?</p>
        <p>
          All the clan guardian had done after coming to his courtyard was eat
          and sleep. He could not even feel a wink of responsibility from her
          bearings.
        </p>
        <p>He sighed; she was too useless.</p>
        <p>After throwing a blanket over her, he silently left the room.</p>
        <p>
          He took out the syringe and went behind his courtyard to the secret
          spot to finally use it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since Nadia was not going to accept it, he would have to use this
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Honorable Stars Essence] was going to help his espera gain an
          elemental attribute.
        </p>
        <p>"Let's begin."</p>
        <p>
          Pulling the syringe back, he rolled his sleeves and injected the
          seaweed-green liquid in.
        </p>

        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          In the next instant, he felt his body heat up, his mind feeling a
          slight current as he sat down in a meditative position to maintain his
          balance.
        </p>
        <p>Swish! Swish!</p>
        <p>Energy flooded into his body, and a foreign feeling engulfed him.</p>
        <p>
          His throat felt dry and thirsty, his eyes shook as he felt a turbulent
          force within him.
        </p>
        <p>
          This went on for a while before everything calmed down and returned to
          normal.
        </p>
        <p>He relaxed and let out a breath of fresh air.</p>
        <p>"I awakened an element..."</p>
        <p>He mumbled, a certain excitement and eagerness in his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          Moving his left hand in front of him, he summoned his minuscule
          espera, which took a while, but he did manage to finally see his
          element up close.
        </p>
        <p>
          In front of him was a small orb of water floating just in front of his
          palm, clearly visible in the night.
        </p>
        <p>
          The water was crystal clear, reflecting the moonlight; Oliver felt as
          if he was holding a beautiful gem in his hand.
        </p>
        <p>Like a silver transparent round gem floating in the air.</p>
        <p>
          He clutched his palm, wanting to feel it, but it quickly burst, and
          water splashed around, wetting his palm.
        </p>

        <p>
          He smiled; he had awakened the water element attribute to his espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was just that he would need to train hard to be able to control his
          espera properly in order to use the elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier he had intended to benefit from Nadia; if she drank then he
          would obtain a tenfold boost, and it was also possible that she might
          have advanced to Rank-1 giving him the benefits.
        </p>
        <p>"It's not useful to think of that. What's done is done."</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the blanket of stars covering the sky and felt it was
          beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          While his espera talent level was pathetically low, he might still be
          able to achieve some improvements through hard work and various
          elixirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was happy that he was able to obtain or awaken the water element
          attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haha, I should get back now... there are many things to prepare
          for... I should be prepared for the auction."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver huffed as he got on his feet and looked at the sky.</p>
        <p>_________</p>
        <p>
          Not far away from him, Zippy the lazy cat who was supposed to be
          sleeping was not asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, she had her eyes opened and was looking at the wall, the
          direction where Oliver had left.
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched the blank wall silently with calm eyes; after a while, she
          closed her eyes and went back to sleep as if nothing had happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          She let out a small smirk unconsciously; it was unclear what she was
          thinking at that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had she seen what Oliver has been doing? Or was she just in the middle
          of a dream?
        </p>
        <p>A month went by just like that...</p>
        <p>
          In this time, Oliver remained low and focused on his training,
          casually leaving to buy out some resources to improve his body and
          espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The auction was going to be held soon; the dates had not yet been
          announced so he had been keeping himself updated through the exorcist
          web.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more thing he got to know about was the 'Demon Hunt' organized by
          his clan.
        </p>
        <p>Something unexpected had happened...</p>

        <h2>Chapter 43: Teaching the impudent clan guardian a lesson!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 43</p>
        <p>He got to know about the 'Demon Hunt' organized by his clan.</p>
        <p>
          He was one day suddenly informed by his maid about it and how it was
          mandatory for him to participate in it as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          He argued about how he would not be able to contend given his strength
          but received a counter that stated that all the heirs of the clan must
          participate, it has been a long tradition of his clan to nurture the
          young heirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention that the event would be supervised properly to
          ensure that no one dies by the elders themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the clan's heirs were potential assets of that clan so it would be
          extremely stupid to let them die out in hunt early on... when they
          could grow to be powerhouses in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt confused by all of this. They clearly knew how talentless
          he was but still ordered him to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he had always lived in isolation so suddenly calling
          out to him was a surprise to him.
        </p>
        <p>What was the reason?</p>
        <p>Was it just mismanagement on their side? Probably not.</p>
        <p>
          Was he supposed to be a bait and be eliminated for good during the
          hunt? Unlikely, considering they could dispose him anytime they want.
        </p>
        <p>Or...</p>
        <p>Were they aware of his recent increase in strength?</p>
        <p>
          That would definitely explain why they wanted him to also join the
          hunt, they must want to determine his worth at the hunting ground
          directly and possibly uncover his secret to the sudden growth.
        </p>
        <p>If this was so, then how did they come to know of it?</p>

        <p>
          Would they have not directly detained him the moment they realized
          that he had somehow gotten strong and had awakened strange powers?
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, a common person with no talent or power suddenly becoming
          strong one day would definitely arouse suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suspicion that they had come in contact with a demon and had
          formed a contract with them thus becoming a heretic who had betrayed
          humanity and embraced demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such people would directly be taken by the clans for an interrogation
          and cleansing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, cleansing, the clans were aware of how fickle-minded people were
          and how cunning demons were.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demons would approach them when they were at their lowest,
          offering countless benefits and allures, brainwashing their minds into
          thinking they were allies and forming contracts to enslave their souls
          and control their bodies like puppets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only ordinary humans but even exorcists were victims of such
          tactics. Demons were skilled and cunning, they used emotions like
          anger, jealousy, lust and pride to establish control.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, the clans had special cleansing and purification techniques that
          helped the possessed heretics to become free from demon's control and
          regain their senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once successful, the demon was either eliminated by banishment or
          captured.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, the stronger the demonic presence, the harder it was.</p>
        <p>
          Overall, the silver lining was that he was not suspected of being a
          heretic which further complicated things for him to decipher.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not understand what the clan elites and elders were thinking
          about him? Were they aware of his special existence or not?
        </p>
        <p>Just as he was deep in thought, he heard a sound.</p>
        <p>"Meow..."</p>
        <p>
          He looked up and saw the lazy white cat yawning while stretching her
          body.
        </p>
        <p>She looked at him and extended her paw as if demanding something.</p>

        <p>Her face showed what she wanted to say.</p>
        <p>
          It was clearly saying, 'It's time, go and prepare my meal, what are
          you dozing off to?'
        </p>
        <p>"...."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her speechlessly, he finally understood the reason
          about why he was told to join the hunt as well.
        </p>
        <p>It was all this damn cat's fault!</p>
        <p>
          She had probably used her authority to add his name in the list of
          candidates as well.
        </p>
        <p>"You..."</p>
        <p>
          He let out a strained smile as he controlled his facial expressions,
          he was super pissed at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian must have used her authority or else there was no
          other way to explain the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          His powers were not exposed and he was still required to join the
          demon hunt event?
        </p>
        <p>He would be a fool to not know why this happened now.</p>
        <p>
          And looking at her shamelessly extending her paw while laying on the
          mat further made him lose his mind.
        </p>
        <p>He took a deep breath to calm himself.</p>
        <p>
          "You want food, right? I will prepare a special treat for you today
          because of your good work."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver smiled in a strange manner and announced as he slowly got up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zippy's ears perked up when she heard of special treat as saliva
          started to form in her mouth, she had to admit that the meals this boy
          cooked were quite good.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although she did not understand what he meant by 'good work', she
          didn't care, her entire focus was on imagining what special treat was
          she going to get today.
        </p>
        <p>She was quite excited to try what he was preparing!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver went to the kitchen and started preparing something, he had no
          expression on his face at this moment. His eyes were dull as he
          chopped off a vegetable into two.
        </p>
        <p>It was quite scary how nonchalantly he was cooking.</p>
        <p>"Zippy, you won't mind a little spice, right?"</p>
        <p>
          He asked in a soft voice to which the cat replied with a soft meow as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason, the cat felt a strange chill in her heart that she
          quite didn't understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Are demons ready for war?' She puzzlingly thought of why she was
          feeling this bad premonition in her heart but she soon discarded the
          notion of war taking place anytime soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, she looked at Oliver and gave her consent, she liked
          spicy things!
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing the cat nodding like a human, he didn't react and looked back
          at the dish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides him were two bottles of suspiciously labeled sauces. It was
          unknown who had brought them and for what purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at those familiar bottles and his mind had flashbacks of
          him bargaining with the shopkeeper for this and the warnings the shop
          owner repeatedly gave him to use it in very little amounts.
        </p>
        <p>
          He picked up the bottle and poured it on the dish without stopping,
          his eyes had no light as he prepared the dish.
        </p>
        <p>"It's ready."</p>
        <p>
          He placed the dish and softly called for the cat who eagerly rushed.
        </p>
        <p>Sniff...</p>
        <p>
          The cat sniffed and felt the dish smelled funny for some reason but
          glancing up at Oliver's smiling and peaceful face, she felt she was
          being too sensitive.
        </p>
        <p>'Well then, let's dig in~!'</p>
        <p>Crunch!</p>
        <p>She took a huge bite...</p>
        <p>In the very next instant, an explosion happened!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 44: Why was he left alive...?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 44</p>
        <p>'Well then, let's dig in~!'</p>
        <p>Crunch!</p>
        <p>She took a huge bite...</p>
        <p>In the very next instant, her mouth exploded in fire!</p>
        <p>"Meow-! Meow-! Meow-!"</p>
        <p>
          She cried out in shock, the dish tasted extremely horrible and
          disgusting, not to mention it was too spicy, it was as if someone had
          directly poured lava inside her mouth.
        </p>
        <p>"I am glad you enjoyed."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver replied in a happy tone as he slowly got up and left the
          wailing cat behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          After coming out in his courtyard, he looked at the trees and admired
          the scenery, he fell into thought.
        </p>
        <p>'I can't understand one thing...'</p>
        <p>
          He pondered about something that has been bugging him for a while.
        </p>

        <p>
          In his memories, the Mystic Purge Clan has always been cruel and
          indifferent to everything around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This same principle was also applied to raising the heirs of the clan
          as well.
        </p>
        <p>They only valued strength and did not even acknowledge the weak.</p>
        <p>
          If he, who had been born as a talentless child with no strength and
          potential then why were they raising him?
        </p>
        <p>He felt quite conflicted about this...</p>
        <p>
          They had already appraised him to be worthless at his birth but still
          decided to let him live, albeit in isolation and bear the clan's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a big deal, assuming the name of one of the top clans was no
          joking matter. It was extremely serious as it defined your
          affiliations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why were they acknowledging him as part of the clan despite his
          weakness?
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing his mother's cruel and maniac attitude, it was quite possible
          for her to dispose of him just after he was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one would have opposed her either, it would have been extremely
          simple and efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he was not provided any resources or privileges like other
          heirs, his overall life was much better and peaceful than the
          commoners, it was befitting that of someone from noble heritage.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a whole isolated courtyard to himself, had multiple maids doing
          his chores, like cooking, washing, cleaning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, he also had a teacher who taught him regularly about
          academics and strategies of war.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is it because they pity me and wanted me to raise a strategist for
          the clan's future heirs? Or did they appraise my intellect level
          somehow after birth?'
        </p>

        <p>
          He felt that only these were the reasons they would keep him alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          His clan was filled with cruel and psychotic bastards who wouldn't
          even show kindness to a newborn in war. They would gladly commit all
          sorts of war crimes to win. That's how they were.
        </p>
        <p>'Or is there a deeper reason for this whole situation...?'</p>
        <p>He felt a bit anxious when he thought of this.</p>
        <p>
          Ophelia, his mother, in the novel was portrayed to be very
          manipulative and ambitious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after feeling the minimal of emotions, she understood human
          psychology too well and was thus an expert when it came to influencing
          others through her actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          She always kept everything under her control, she would prepare
          deliberate and long-term plans and slowly make everything flow
          according to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt uneasy thinking that the only reason he was allowed to live
          and grow was to be used by her in one of her sinister plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this was the case then he felt that he had made a correct decision
          by joining the 'Black Codex Federation' earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          He must become independent fast, although there was no guarantee that
          he would be completely free from her control if he left the clan and
          severed all ties with her, it was still reasonably safer if he did
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The world and its people are complex, I might not even realize before
          I get dragged into someone's scheme."
        </p>
        <p>
          He should be cautious of who he associates with and build his own
          strength first and foremost before anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, he still had the backing of the Black Codex Federation so
          even if he left the clan in the future, he could still be involved in
          world matters while also being safe.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver felt more inclined to believe that his existence was a part of
          Ophelia's greater future plan and the sole reason he was left alive
          and not bothered.
        </p>
        <p>
          But of course, he could not let her succeed in whatever it was that
          she was planning.
        </p>
        <p>Tap Tap</p>
        <p>
          Two small knocks were made on the paper door of his room as he saw a
          feminine silhouette on the other side.
        </p>
        <p>"Young master, may I come in?"</p>
        <p>
          The soft voice of a woman sounded as he replied with a simple word.
        </p>
        <p>"Enter."</p>
        <p>
          The paper door slid open and a woman dressed in maid clothing entered
          the room, in her hands, she was holding something long wrapped in a
          brown-colored cloth.
        </p>
        <p>He was calm as he saw his maid enter.</p>
        <p>
          He had ordered her to buy him something from the market earlier during
          the day, although he very rarely asked anything from the servants
          knowing his status, this time, however, he asked them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing she was holding was a rapier that he had asked one of the
          local blacksmiths in the clan market to prepare for him...
        </p>
        <p>
          It was when he had gone to the market to buy the smoke capsules and
          aphrodisiac to cause distractions among guards.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had also ordered for a rapier at that time that he could use to
          train and practice the [Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom].
        </p>
        <p>
          He had paid for it beforehand and just asked the maid to visit the
          blacksmith and fetch it for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was initially going to go himself but when he was informed of his
          mandatory participation in the hunt, he decided to give the clan hints
          about his strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, he could not just keep hiding his strength and then
          suddenly stand out on the day of the hunting event. That would put him
          under more suspicion.
        </p>
        <p>
          So he had decided to let his clan believe that he had taken the path
          of a physical exorcist, training his strength and learning martial
          exorcism techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a physical exorcist was quite easier in general as compared to
          the other twoâespera based and tool-based.
        </p>
        <p>It was a known fact that a person with...</p>

        <h2>Chapter 45: The auction is finally here!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 45</p>
        <p>
          Even a person with below-average espera talent level could eventually
          train physically daily and start on his path as a physical exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The requirements for this type were quite minimal, and a large
          population of exorcists were physical exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt that this was an appropriate action from his side; the
          maids reported all his actions to the higher-ups so naturally, such an
          anomaly in his daily actions would be reported quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          This way, he would have to face less trouble once he reveals a portion
          of his strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew there was no other choice than this; the clan elders and his
          mother were not stupid.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were all veteran exorcists and could discern his capabilities at
          a glance if he slipped out even slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that moment, he wouldn't be able to handle the consequences for it,
          so he decided it was better to let them know beforehand that he was
          not entirely useless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he barely had any espera, and Nadia was not going to
          break through to become a Rank-1 exorcist any time soon, most
          probably. So even if they thoroughly sensed him, they would only find
          that he had slightly greater strength and nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>
          He unwrapped the brown cloth from the weapon anew, and a shiny rapier
          came into view.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had a silver body and a bluish handle to hold it. The rapier was
          beautifully designed and looked robust to some degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          He swung the rapier around and felt that it should be enough for him
          to freely practice the [Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom] daily.
        </p>

        <p>
          He felt that the rapier was just an extension of his hand as he moved
          the weapon very gracefully with slow movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maid looked at him in a trance as she felt that the rapier was
          moving very beautifully. It was as if an expert was making the weapon
          dance.
        </p>
        <p>
          She got out of her daze when he stopped the movements and put it down.
        </p>
        <p>"You did good; you can leave now."</p>
        <p>Oliver said to her as he folded his hands.</p>
        <p>
          The maid understood that he wanted to be left alone and quickly got
          up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Understood, if the young master wants anything else in the future,
          please call for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          She told him in a professional tone, indicating that if he did
          something like this again, he should inform them first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, he didn't care what she meant or not. His purpose was
          fulfilled; he was now sure that soon his news would reach the ears of
          those who were interested.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I might even receive slightly better treatment as well if all goes
          well in the future...'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver mused; strength was everything after all.</p>
        <p>
          He took out his smartphone from a hidden box and looked up to see
          updates about the auction, and sure enough, the date has been
          released. It's in about a week from now.
        </p>
        <p>"Finally, it's here..."</p>
        <p>______________</p>

        <p>
          For the rest of the following week, all he did was train his special
          eyes, martial techniques, or his water element.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had become quite proficient in using the [Six Thoughtful Steps of
          the Spirits] technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shape training method was indeed very useful for a beginner like
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been slowly increasing the number of shapes every day as he
          improved, and now he could easily cross 150 shapes without breaking a
          sweat.
        </p>
        <p>
          His speed and strength were quite good now... although it was not much
          in this world's standards, to him, who was once a normal person in an
          ordinary world, it was incredible!
        </p>
        <p>
          He has also been practicing [Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom]
          daily this whole week, and he had to admit although he felt familiar
          the more he practiced, the technique was quite tough to master.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was ten times harder than [Press of Liberty], so while its impact
          was tenfold stronger, all the other requirements were also harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, at least I still have the experience from Nadia's training...'
        </p>
        <p>As for his water element, the progress was slow but it was there.</p>
        <p>
          He knew that unless he awakened a good espera talent, the speed would
          remain slow like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The auction was today, and he was just getting ready to visit the
          market where it was going to be held.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zippy, I'll be going to the market, will probably be late; your food
          is on the table."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver shouted behind; the clan guardian has been docile ever since
          the previous incident, which made him satisfied.
        </p>

        <p>
          By now, he had gotten used to living with the cat, considering the
          fact that the cat also had intellect, he treated her as a person and
          thus prepared her food before leaving.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was carrying a bag behind his back which had the rapier he had
          purchased a week ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the auction house would not allow him to bring any weapons
          inside, so he intended to leave it outside.
        </p>
        <p>He had brought it just in case some situation developed.</p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>Zip!</p>
        <p>
          He opened his bag and took out a black summer cap and a plain white
          mask which he quickly wore.
        </p>
        <p>The market was noisy today considering the special day it was.</p>
        <p>
          Rich and influential people from various places had come to visit the
          clan today in hopes of joining the auction.
        </p>
        <p>So the market was bustling with activities.</p>
        <p>Of course, this was entirely limited to the market.</p>
        <p>
          The place where the auction was going to be held was quiet, and
          multiple exorcists in uniforms were patrolling the area around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could spot multiple people in fancy coats and gowns entering
          the extravagant auction house.
        </p>
        <p>
          His features were concealed, and unless someone deliberately removed
          his cap and mask, they wouldn't easily recognize him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went to the gates of the auction where he was stopped by the guards
          at the entrance who looked at him weirdly.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, who wouldn't feel weird upon seeing a small boy in black,
          silk-made kimono with a weird full-face white mask and black summer
          cap coming to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were, however, professionals, and since there was no formal dress
          code specified, the guests were free to dress however they wished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, all the people here were very powerful and influential; the
          guards wouldn't want to offend a powerful exorcist in disguise.
        </p>
        <p>"Guest, please show the ticket and verify your identity."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 46: Countering all experts back! No restraint shown!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 46</p>
        <p>
          "Guest, please show the tickets and verify your identity," the guards
          pointed towards a screen where Oliver scanned his smartphone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The auction had issued tickets months ago, and only those with the
          tickets were allowed to enter.
        </p>
        <p>
          After successfully scanning the ticket, one of the guards politely
          pointed him towards a direction inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was not too impressed by the scanning system; he had seen
          plenty in his previous life. These tickets had sensors embedded into
          them that would help authentication.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there was a chance that someone would steal your ticket and
          impersonate you.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no biometric information required to participate in the
          auction house to maintain their guests' privacy and background.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you let your ticket get stolen, then you are simply not worthy
          enough to enter the auction house!
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the person who stole the ticket should also have
          enough wealth to even dare to dream to bargain in the auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sir, please, this way." A woman called out to Oliver who walked
          towards the woman in staff clothing; she handed him a white metallic
          plate with the number 69.
        </p>
        <p>
          She smiled and explained, "Sir, this is your ID number until you leave
          the auction house. If you wish to bid, then simply raise this plate up
          or tap on it thrice. You will be allowed to bid the amount."
        </p>
        <p>
          He took the metallic ID plate with the number 69 and asked, "Where can
          we store our belongings?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to store his bag outside since he knew he wouldn't be
          allowed inside otherwise; the guards would look at every item the
          guests had brought along if they wished to bring it inside.
        </p>

        <p>
          "For that, you can use one of the lockers for public use, or you can
          pay to get a private locker. The latter being more secure and
          spacious."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at her speechlessly; even in the auction house, they were
          trying to make profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed as he realized the rich big-shots would directly get
          themselves the private safe, but he decided otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, he didn't intend to waste money on the private safe
          considering the public locker was just equally safer due to its
          location and the guards outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, if there was an emergency, he could directly access his
          public safe without needing a middleman to get to the private safe.
        </p>
        <p>"I'll take the public locker."</p>
        <p>"Definitely, please follow me."</p>
        <p>After placing his bag inside the locker, he was finally ready.</p>
        <p>"Let's begin."</p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>
          The main hall was dark and spacious; there were multiple seats
          arranged in front of a huge stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          When Oliver reached the hall, there were already multiple people
          seated inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as he stepped foot inside, his body felt a slight invisible
          pressure from all sides. He felt as if he was being pressed down by
          something invisible...
        </p>
        <p>
          He took a deep breath and slowly adjusted to the invisible pressure.
          He had already expected a room filled with strange and mysteriously
          powerful people to be like this.
        </p>
        <p>No sooner did he enter, he felt multiple gazes on him.</p>

        <p>
          In the dark, many exorcists were slightly curious about this new
          arrival with a strange mask and cap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for their curiosity was simple; they were unable to feel
          his strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many openly sent espera waves to sense his level but in the end were
          puzzled when they were unable to feel anything from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some had a strange expression as they felt that this mysterious boy
          was stronger than them so they decisively withdrew their espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many followed the suite and withdrew their espera; it was a known
          knowledge that constantly trying to probe someone with espera was
          considered rude and offensive to the party as it was akin to violating
          their privacy.
        </p>
        <p>And none of them wanted trouble with someone stronger than them.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver also realized this thanks to his deep knowledge about the
          culture and other stuff from the novel, but he could still feel some
          lingering gazes.
        </p>
        <p>
          He followed the direction, and his focus fell onto the second floor of
          the hall; there were many small balconies over there that were hidden
          by darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Literal darkness... it was evident that they were using devices to
          harness darkness element to provide the cover before the auction
          begins.
        </p>
        <p>What a privilege!</p>
        <p>
          He could himself sense that all the gazes that mostly still remained
          on him were from up there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those balconies were attached to private rooms behind and were
          specially assigned to VIPs.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could be seen that even among such a powerful gathering, there were
          VIPs which told about the strength and influence they had.
        </p>
        <p>He felt slightly annoyed by their persistent gazes.</p>

        <p>
          In the end, he directly used [Cosmic Void Gaze] and started looking
          towards each balcony one by one where he felt the gazes from.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the [Cosmic Void Gaze], he saw all hidden details, the other
          party was as clear as an elephant in a crowd of humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Sure enough, they are VIPs... each of them is dangerously strong.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt goosebumps looking at the cluster of espera radiating from the
          individuals; it was wild and fierce, ready to claw at the enemies. All
          these people were definitely expert exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>There might be exorcists as high as Rank-2 present today!</p>
        <p>This showed how precious items were going to be today!</p>
        <p>
          As Oliver looked at each person back with [Cosmic Void Gaze], he felt
          them swiftly retracting their gazes back. He was using the
          intimidation, albeit suppressing it significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not force too much or his energy will deplete quickly and he
          would become more vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was how this world worked; unless you showed others your power,
          they would continue to bully you and think of you as a pushover.
        </p>
        <p>
          It did not mean that you have to directly jump into fights with others
          but to show them that you are capable of countering them and handling
          them if necessary!
        </p>
        <p>
          Hiding his strength always would not favor him in any way; he was not
          a coward but a cautious person with his safety as his first and
          foremost priority.
        </p>
        <p>As he looked at them one by one, they all withdrew their senses.</p>
        <p>Satisfied, he took his seat among the many others.</p>
        <p>
          Naturally, he was not allowed to have a private chamber to himself
          since he was not actually that strong nor was he a registered VIP in
          today's auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was just that he could intimidate others easily with [Cosmic Void
          Gaze], nothing more nothing less.
        </p>
        <p>
          The VIPs who were all repelled by him earlier were stunned for a
          moment; they had been expecting him to be a distinguished individual
          like themselves but in the end, they saw him taking the seat on the
          floor below among the normal guests.
        </p>
        <p>What did this mean?</p>
        <p>
          Did this mean that they were countered by someone weaker than them?
        </p>
        <p>Of course not!</p>
        <p>It simply meant that he was a hidden expert!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 47: Auction continues....</h2>
        <p>Chapter 47</p>
        <p>
          It simply meant that this person had a deep background and preferred
          to keep a low profile.
        </p>
        <p>He was most likely a hidden expert!</p>
        <p>
          Among the many people on the 2nd floor was a particular balcony and
          there was a woman with a very feminine and enticing silhouette
          sitting.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had great curves and was radiating no espera just like Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even Oliver did not look at her direction since he had not felt a gaze
          from her earlier.
        </p>
        <p>The woman in the dark face-palmed herself as she let out a sigh.</p>
        <p>"What is this little kid doing here?"</p>
        <p>This woman was none other than Jenna Sullivan!</p>
        <p>
          And right now, she was contemplating about Oliver; initially, she had
          come to this auction upon being invited by the clan and receiving some
          information about the various artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were going to be some special artifacts that she wanted to bid
          for.
        </p>
        <p>
          She arrived at the auction early, and out of nowhere, he also joined
          the auction hall.
        </p>
        <p>White mask, black cap... he couldn't look more suspicious!</p>
        <p>
          Although his get-up was so-so for his level, she was able to recognize
          him easily.
        </p>

        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>Because this silly kid forgot to change his clothes!</p>
        <p>He had worn the exact same kimono he had worn when they had met.</p>
        <p>
          She shook her head, if someone had seen him that day then they would
          easily recognize him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was good that he was within his clan boundaries so she didn't have
          to look out for him as a superior.
        </p>
        <p>
          The worst that could happen was punishment from the clan if he pulled
          any tricks.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he had done such a carelessness outside in the world where all
          sorts of individuals were rampant, they would not hesitate to behead
          him if he somehow offended them.
        </p>
        <p>'Could he be any more stupid...?'</p>
        <p>
          She sighed, at least he was still wearing the [Wrap of Quantum
          Darkness] he had taken from her last time.
        </p>
        <p>"No... I won't get into his matters."</p>
        <p>
          She had no intentions to get involved with this witty brat at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          No espera, openly challenging people stronger than him, bluffing his
          way out...
        </p>
        <p>
          It was better not to get involved with him or else she might also get
          dragged if he falls into trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          She steeled her mind and looked at the stage where the auctioneer had
          finally arrived holding a microphone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The auctioneer was a young and attractive woman; she dressed boldly
          and her make-up was not bad. This was all done to keep the audience
          interested.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Welcome, ladies and gentlemen. As you may all know, this is the
          yearly auction that takes place here around this time every year. The
          rules here are quite simple, just like any other auction, if you wish
          to buy an item, simply raise your bid with the specified amount."
        </p>
        <p>
          She paused and looked at the audience before continuing, "And of
          course, no disruptions will be tolerated, I am sure everyone
          experienced is already aware of this but for the newcomers, do note
          that you're inside the boundaries of the Mystic Purge Clan so if you
          act out of order then be prepared to deal with the consequences. Rest
          you are all smart enough."
        </p>
        <p>"Then without delay, let's begin the auction!"</p>
        <p>
          She said in a cheerful voice as she pressed a button and lights became
          focused on the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          A man dressed in coat and pants entered the stage with a metallic
          trolley.
        </p>
        <p>
          He swiftly placed a glass box on the table placed at the center of the
          stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And our very first item is this Moonstone Pipe. An excellent choice
          if you're in need of peace or need enhanced focus! The starting bid
          will be starting from 400,000 Neden!"
        </p>
        <p>"500,000..."</p>
        <p>"900,000!"</p>
        <p>"1,200,000!"</p>
        <p>"1,500,000...!"</p>
        <p>
          People started bidding immediately just as the auctioneer stopped.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver stroked his chin as he thought of the instrument.</p>
        <p>
          It could be said that the auction staff did not provide the details
          about the artifact; it was possible that the details would be
          disclosed after purchase or that only some items will be described
          properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          During the auction, the item would only be introduced briefly; the
          rest depended on the ability of the bidder to discern the true value
          of the item and bid for it against others who recognized the item.
        </p>

        <p>
          If he had not guessed wrongly, [The Moonlight Pipe] was an artifact
          related to instrumental type, and probably has the ability to draw the
          moon's energy to provide a calming effect to the person using it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's it! The item has been purchased by number 33 for 4 million
          Neden! You can collect your items after the auction! Congratulations!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The auctioneer congratulated the person and moved onto the next item.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The next item! It's called [The Glow of The Slave] and is a
          purification tool which is highly effective against medium-ranking
          demons! It has been crafted by one of the senior blacksmiths from the
          Forging Association!"
        </p>
        <p>"The starting price will be 1 million Neden!"</p>
        <p>"1,300,000!"</p>
        <p>"1,400,000!"</p>
        <p>"1,700,000!"</p>
        <p>"1,950,000!"</p>
        <p>"2,500,000...!"</p>
        <p>
          The bids were raised fiercely; none of the guests present wanted to
          miss an exorcism tool crafted by a senior forger from the Forging
          association!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was interested in the instrument but did not bid; he was
          waiting for something even better. Although these things were quite
          good, it was not something he wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The auction continued, and Oliver just waited; there were many great
          items, from precious herbs to mysterious weapons and artifacts,
          nothing was lacking; he was even offered free refreshments as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more thing he noticed was that none of the people on the second
          floor had bid on anything yet, which meant that they probably either
          had similar thoughts as him or they had special advanced information
          about the items that were going to be displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We will now be taking a short break, and the phase 2 of the auction
          will take place afterwards."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, some people slowly dispersed and left, while some stayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear that they knew the 2nd phase would be for the big shots
          and bids would be very pricey undoubtedly. So it was a waste of time
          to stay.
        </p>
        <p>
          He noticed that a good chunk of people on the lower floor had left and
          now it was quite sparse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people on the upper floors in the balconies were still seated,
          obviously waiting for the second phase eagerly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He calmly rested his back against the chair and sighed; the true
          auction was about to start, the items were going to be terrifying. He
          was sure there would be excellent stuff that would make them drool.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 48: So she's that sort of person?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 48</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was just drinking green tea served by a waitress when he
          suddenly stopped and frowned.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some time, he could not help but feel a discreet gaze on him from
          time to time.
        </p>
        <p>He was extremely annoyed.</p>
        <p>
          One would ask why he wouldn't just use [Cosmic Void Gaze] like before
          and repel the person again?
        </p>
        <p>
          He also wanted to do that but the problem was that the person who was
          looking at him from time to time was extremely clever and skilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          For him to be able to detect the gaze, he must use his own senses to
          find the direction but the problem was that the person who was
          watching him knew of this and thus was being extremely discreet.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tried many times but could not spot where the gaze was coming from;
          his senses were unable to detect the direction of the person, and thus
          he felt annoyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This person was way stronger than him and was deliberately concealing
          things.
        </p>
        <p>'Fuck! Are you a pervert!? Why are you peeping at me?'</p>
        <p>He cursed internally as he felt the gaze probing him once again.</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and took a deep breath; he must do something about
          it or else he would remain conscious about it throughout the auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not understand why this person was getting so interested in
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did he do something to provoke them? Or was it just plain curiosity of
          theirs?
        </p>

        <p>
          Nonetheless, he started to think of plans he could use to find the
          peeper.
        </p>
        <p>
          After thinking for a few minutes, he came up with a somewhat crude and
          brute approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the person was so interested in him, he would let them watch him
          fully.
        </p>
        <p>At least, he would make them feel so.</p>
        <p>What he meant by that was that this was a part of his plan.</p>
        <p>
          His plan was simple; he was going to verify each balcony one by one
          until he spotted the peeper's place. It was definitely someone from
          the upper floor; his gut told him that.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would wait and secretly focus in the direction of each balcony, and
          if the person tries to peep at him, he would directly know who was
          doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there was a chance that the other party would realize what
          he was pulling but he could not think of other ways that could work in
          this hall.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't intend to make a fuss here or gain attention.</p>
        <p>
          He could only try to be as discreet as he could so that the other
          party, who would be focused on him won't notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon he began executing his plan; one by one, he started filtering the
          people on the upper floor, his senses at the moment were heightened
          and he was picking up on any signals directed towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could tell the person was an expert and he wouldn't know their
          location until they wanted him to...
        </p>
        <p>
          'Should I really provoke such a person? Of course not but their gaze
          is unsettling and annoying. I will just let them know that I can see
          them and see how it goes...'
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon, he had filtered out most of the individuals; he could now
          somewhat tell where the person was, so instead of waiting for them to
          look at him, he directly looked at a particular balcony.
        </p>
        <p>He felt their eyes meet and the expert soon withdrew their gaze.</p>

        <p>
          He felt that he had implied his meaning and was satisfied that things
          didn't escalate for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He once started sipping tea only to choke as he felt the person peep
          again.
        </p>
        <p>"What the-!?"</p>
        <p>
          He used [Cosmic Void Gaze] and looked at the person directly wanting
          to know who they were...
        </p>
        <p>
          'No... wait, suppressing a huge amount of espers... I cannot mistake
          it...'
        </p>
        <p>His eyes widened as he recognized the woman in the balcony.</p>
        <p>'It's her!'</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but exclaim in shock. He was able to easily
          recognize her. She was none other than Jenna!
        </p>
        <p>'What's she doing here?'</p>
        <p>
          He felt it was stupid to think that, considering her power and
          influence, it was natural that she would also be invited over to
          attend the auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what he could not understand was why in the world did she keep
          throwing him glances?
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been quite bothered by her constant probing and felt weird.
        </p>
        <p>'Wait, could it be that she is a...?'</p>
        <p>
          He suddenly had a bad premonition, he assumed a dark possibility that
          he did not want to admit.
        </p>
        <p>
          He suddenly thought about his past interactions with her and made some
          conclusions...
        </p>

        <p>He was a child? Check!</p>
        <p>She was desperate for him to join the organization? Check!</p>
        <p>She was so desperate that she gave an artifact for free? Check!</p>
        <p>She had been constantly probing him secretly? Check!</p>
        <p>He was feeling weird? Check!</p>
        <p>'Surely she's not into that sort of stuff, right?'</p>
        <p>
          He hesitantly asked himself, she looked dignified and had a superior
          aura and beauty.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was also an extremely powerful exorcist... she shouldn't have such
          a dark side, right?
        </p>
        <p>He suddenly felt that things were making sense.</p>
        <p>Was she a trash who engaged into those activities?</p>
        <p>
          That's right! Oliver was now suspicious of her true intentions behind
          making him join the Black Codex Federation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had no idea who she was from the novel so it was possible that she
          was some erratic side character who liked to engage in such illegal
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he unknowingly became her target, it was possible that she was
          grooming him slowly and later ask for extreme stuff?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was likely that he might become her victim in the future as well!
        </p>
        <p>
          What other reason did she have to secretly look at himâpeep on him
          instead of boldly displaying her intent? She must have bad thoughts
          otherwise...
        </p>
        <p>'No!'</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, he was being too paranoid and was drawing too many
          conclusions but nonetheless, he still felt that Jenna was a suspicious
          person and he might become her victim if he was not careful enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          He weirdly glanced at her direction with a sympathetic gaze, even
          after being such an exaggerated beauty, she still suffered from such
          mental disorders.
        </p>
        <p>What a pity!</p>
        <p>A healthy grown woman only to be like this?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 49: Life-draining weapon? The auction is good!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 49</p>
        <p>
          He suddenly felt her gaze turn intense for a moment as if she felt his
          sympathy.
        </p>
        <p>"Anyways, don't bother me."</p>
        <p>
          He mouthed the words for her to understand, shifting his face mask
          slightly and used [Cosmic Void Gaze] to see her response.
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason, he felt she was angry and her gaze was hostile,
          though she quickly calmed down soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          He read her mouth, "(I am not interested in your activities, don't get
          me into trouble.)" and was speechless.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but wonder if she was really not interested, if she
          was really not interested then why was she staring at him again and
          again earlier?
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, she had the audacity to tell him to not create trouble
          for her? She was really bold!
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he had told her what he wanted to and felt this should be
          enough for her to not bother him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed, even though he was the child here, why did he feel as if
          she was the one who behaved like a little kid?
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that she had probably already recognized him earlier and
          that's why she kept looking at him. This was why he did not hesitate
          to shift his mask and reply to her for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought about what gave away his identity? Did she recognize him by
          his height? His aura should be negligible for her to sense after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or did she see the [Wrap of Quantum Darkness] somehow under his
          clothes?
        </p>

        <p>As he thought of this, he felt she was indeed a pervert.</p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>
          "Welcome back ladies and gentlemen! The phase two of the auction will
          now be beginning!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The auctioneer had changed, and her tone was more serious than before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without wasting a second, she announced, "Bring in the first item!" as
          two men approached the stage, holding a brown leather box.
        </p>
        <p>Click!</p>
        <p>
          With a click, one of them slowly opened the box, unleashing a dark and
          sinister esper from the contents withinâit was a blade!
        </p>
        <p>
          A fairly long, thin blade made of ceramic, gripped by expensive
          ruby-red buffalo skin, greeted the audience. Its razor-sharp point
          made it a perfect choice for those wishing to puncture their enemies
          with ruthless speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blade's spiked, slightly warped cross-guard ensured an ideal
          weight balance, facilitating smooth and accurate swings. Plain coils
          adorned each side of the cross-guard, a common feature on many
          weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          A large pommel decorated with modest gems adorned the weapon; anything
          more extravagant would have seemed wasteful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite its simplicity, the blade bore no markings or engravings; such
          embellishments were deemed too costly, even for demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Engravings were magical and boosted a weapon's strength by multiple
          times; some expert forgers could even add attributes to a weapon!
        </p>
        <p>
          "This blade was once used by a high-ranking wraith monk in the demon
          army according to our sources... the demon was exorcised by the clan
          and its belongings were brought back."
        </p>
        <p>
          She paused, letting the information sink before continuing for the
          eager audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This blade has the power to drain the life force of opponents to some
          degree and induce corruption to both body and soul using the darkness
          element. A very great weapon for the exorcists with darkness element!"
        </p>

        <p>
          The auctioneer smirked as she looked at the anticipated gazes of the
          exorcists in the audience.
        </p>
        <p>"The starting price for this would be 5 million Neden."</p>
        <p>"10 million!"</p>
        <p>"15 million!"</p>
        <p>"25 million!"</p>
        <p>"40 million...!"</p>
        <p>The bids were raised fiercely; no sooner did she stop speaking.</p>
        <p>
          It was evident that almost all of them wanted that blade, a blade once
          used by a high-ranking demon was extraordinary undoubtedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention the life-draining effect; it could significantly boost
          the strength of an exorcist with darkness element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The auctioneer deliberately priced the weapon so low in order to
          provoke the ultra-rich present in the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could only helplessly listen to the absurd amounts being raised
          without batting an eye by these people. Of course, he was also
          interested in buying that blade but could not...
        </p>
        <p>
          The life-draining property was quite the rare find, it would help him
          a lot in the future if he managed to acquire that weapon somehow...
        </p>
        <p>
          It was basically a weapon that could grow to some potential in the
          future by draining life. Such growth-type weapons were extremely rare
          and he was surprised that this auction had managed to get one.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they were even willing to sell it instead of using it themselves?
        </p>
        <p>This was weird...</p>

        <p>Did that weapon carry only a limited potential?</p>
        <p>
          This was likely the case else no one would be stupid enough to sell it
          in an auction...
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt like he was a frog in the bottom of a well and was slightly
          embarrassed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier he was quite happy and proud that he managed to earn 13
          million Neden and felt it would help him buy something in the auction
          but now listening to these people raising tens to hundreds of millions
          like nothing, he fell into doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that he might not even get a chance to purchase anything at
          all in this auction today...
        </p>
        <p>
          'No matter, I should at least sit and look at the things they have...'
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, he sighed and just shrunk back into his plush chair as he
          calmly listened to the excited voices of random exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hopes were crushed but he still stayed just to get a look at the
          things brought out today for them by the auction house.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The Mystic Purge Clan is indeed extremely rich, just a casual weapon
          they put on the auction already raised so much money. As long as one
          had strength, making money was only a matter of time.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered about the precious treasury of his clan and felt that his
          siblings were truly lucky. If they trained hard and grew stronger,
          they would be nurtured by the best of resources in the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia was the prime example of this; he felt a bit better when he
          thought about how he would be receiving tenfold benefits from her in
          the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's it! The blade of the Wraith Monk now belongs to number 42!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was brought back from his thoughts by the loud voice of the
          auctioneer.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't hear clearly but apparently the blade of the Wraith monk was
          sold for around a hundred million Neden.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver laughed to himself as he heard her present the next item.</p>
        <p>
          "The next item is a powerful exorcism technique... it's known by the
          bold name: [Predatory River Method], a technique highly recommended
          for exorcists specializing in using tools!"
        </p>
        <p>She sounded excited as she read the next part.</p>
        <p>
          "This technique has been developed from the teaching of Barcia Darbi,
          the famous battle exorcist! Some people say that she has left to look
          for challenges in the demon territory. Moving onto, this technique
          has..."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver's ears perked up when he heard the name.</p>
        <p>'Barcia Darbi... huh.'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 50: A useless-looking stone? Or not...</h2>
        <p>Chapter 50</p>
        <p>
          "A characteristic for this style is 'Taking a life is never to be done
          lightly,' and in battles, it can be recognized by its distinctive
          footwork!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is best suited for those using a two-weapon fighting style. The
          starting price will begin at 20 million Neden!"
        </p>
        <p>"30 million Neden!"</p>
        <p>"35 million Neden!"</p>
        <p>"60 million Neden...!"</p>
        <p>
          The bids were once again raised; Oliver heard people from the upper
          floors also bidding for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          He fell into thought; according to the auctioneer, this technique was
          developed by the teachings left behind by Barcia Darbi.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the novel, she was a side character who challenged the protagonist
          once due to her extreme battle tendencies but was defeated by the
          protagonist who at that time had grown significantly!
        </p>
        <p>
          She was quite strong and even had a dedicated martial school
          associated with her name. She served as a stepping-stone for the
          protagonist to grow further.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the battle, the protagonist learned a thing or two about her
          style and improved.
        </p>

        <p>That's all the purpose she had served in the story in summary.</p>
        <p>
          He calmly looked ahead; the technique was indeed good for him at his
          level but unfortunately he did not have enough funds at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, it was sold for 120 million Neden.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver patiently waited as more and more items came and went; most of
          the items were purchased instantly by the rich but there were still
          some items that were either not purchased by anyone or that were bid
          very low for.
        </p>
        <p>
          These items were probably too lacking for these people who remained
          and he could understand why. These items were either lacking in esper
          and looked ugly, or did not sound too useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the second phase of the auction was indeed way superior and
          better than the first phase, there were still things and items that
          were not worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was just eating free snacks when the next item was brought out
          and the auctioneer announced its details.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The next item we have on our list belonged to once-renowned exorcist
          family; it was said that the family fell to ruin after the war and
          their descendants are now living somewhere in seclusion. Present the
          item!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The male attendants quickly put the item on the display table for all
          the audience to see.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an ordinary-looking stone with some esper flowing out of it and
          giving the stone occasional glows of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The person who put this on auction claims that this stone is a
          powerful artifact that could 'guide the lost through treacherous path
          ahead' or so they said. Now audience, whether it's true or false is up
          to you to decide!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The auctioneer said in enthusiasm but looking at the uninterested
          expressions displayed by the crowd, she felt slightly hesitant; even
          she could not feel anything out of the ordinary from this stone.
        </p>

        <p>
          From her colleagues, she heard the rumor that the Mystic Purge Clan
          apparently had some ties to that family in the last war and thus out
          of basic courtesy, they allowed this item to be prioritized in the
          second phase of the auction instead of the first.
        </p>
        <p>
          It all made sense to her that no one was interested; these people were
          all high-class exorcists from distinguished and wealthy families, such
          an ordinary thing had no place in their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it was still her job to try and sell the items.</p>
        <p>
          "Know that this once belonged to a famed exorcist family before their
          ruin; it might really be something extraordinary!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The crowd murmured as they heard this, feeling slight apprehension;
          what if the stone was really something extraordinary?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hoho... they surely have no taste," An elderly voice rang out among
          the crowd; it was an old man in a white buttoned coat and pants, he
          had a long gray beard and a bald head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adjusting his gold-rimmed glasses slightly, he said, "This is just an
          uncommon rank artifact. I am sure the most it could do is help its
          owner walk at night by acting as an esper torch."
        </p>
        <p>Some people who looked at him could not help but exclaim.</p>
        <p>"It's Mr. Tesshu! He's also here! I can't believe it!"</p>
        <p>"Who's that?" Another person asked in curiosity.</p>
        <p>
          "Don't you know him? He's Sagara Tesshu, the retired junior artifact
          appraiser; he once worked with the Forging Association!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Such an expert! It does make sense for him to attend this auction."
        </p>

        <p>
          The murmurs intensified as people bickered among themselves about the
          authenticity of the stone.
        </p>
        <p>Since an artifact appraiser had spoken, there was no scope left.</p>
        <p>
          The auctioneer glared at the old man for ruining her pitch but
          refrained from speaking; she did not want to offend him because of a
          few words, plus he probably spoke the truth.
        </p>
        <p>She sighed as she looked at the disinterested faces.</p>
        <p>
          In the end, she could only start the bid. She had done what she could
          and it was now up to the people whether to buy this or not.
        </p>
        <p>"The starting price will be... 500,000 Neden."</p>
        <p>
          Hearing her low price, people could not help but form expressions of
          disdain; sure enough, this was not worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all knew that every year, some people would either provide large
          sums of money or use their connections to supply some ordinary ranking
          artifacts into the auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it was not an uncommon sighting to spot some trash among treasures
          every now and then once in a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          These people simply had one motive and that was to be able to fool the
          crowd and earn big by scamming them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A risky act considering the status of people present every year, but
          these people were gamblers who played such games; they were gambling
          addicts!
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there were cases every year where an exorcist would fall
          for this and later realize that the artifact that they had bid on was
          a fake or a low-ranking one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, they would use their wealth and connections to hunt down
          the seller who might or might not be seen again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite such risk, there were always people willing to do that. As
          long as they used sufficient connections in the market and used enough
          money, they could slide one or two such items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, no one cared since it was their fault for not recognizing if the
          item was worthy or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hall was silent; not even the people from the upper floor were
          interested in bidding this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as the auctioneer was about to move onto the next item and
          discard this one, a calm voice sounded in the silent hall, shocking
          everyone.
        </p>
        <p>"500,000 Neden."</p>
