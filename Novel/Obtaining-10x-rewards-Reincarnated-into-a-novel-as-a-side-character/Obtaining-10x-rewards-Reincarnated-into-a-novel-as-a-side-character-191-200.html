        <h2>Chapter 191 &nbsp;Abyss Arts! Sword of Negativity!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 191</p>
        <p>
          For now, he put the matter related to hearts aside and focused on the
          next thing....
        </p>
        <p>
          The abyssal arts he was presented with revolved around a sword
          technique that uses Abyss energy as its foundation.
        </p>
        <p>It was expected since Evelyn had also learned a sword technique.</p>
        <p>
          There were no examples or descriptions given about how powerful it
          would be once mastered.
        </p>
        <p>The sword technique was called [Neglegentis].</p>
        <p>
          Apparently, it was a technique derived from a part of the
          constellation of the Trident.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver exhaled deeply. His breath misted in the cool air, a visible
          manifestation of the weight of the revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't feel as surprised as he had expected from such a revelation.
          He had already suspected that since there was a fantasy world like
          this, then there ought to be more planets out there with their own
          worlds.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that he had received this information quite easily, and it was
          indeed a burden that was quite heavy for him to carry.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the system to grant him a technique belonging to another
          civilization—or perhaps another world—signaled that there were worlds
          out there that had developed powers strong enough to be recognized by
          the verse.
        </p>
        <p>
          A spark of excitement flared in his chest, a fire kindled by the idea
          of such immense possibilities. His blood was boiling with excitement,
          but he suppressed himself from getting too carried away. In the end,
          he was still considered an ant in the grand scheme of things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let alone the other worlds, he could not even boast about his safety
          in his own world. There were terrifying demons and exorcists that
          could topple the course of nature with their strength. He didn't know
          how they compared to vast powers outside, but he knew that it was a
          matter that didn't need his immediate attention.
        </p>

        <p>
          Right now, his goal should be to become stronger—strong enough to be
          free in this world, so that he could take actions without worrying too
          much about consequences and his safety.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he could not even reach that level, then there was no point in
          thinking outside.
        </p>
        <p>There were still many things that he could explore.</p>
        <p>
          The Abyss sword arts [Neglegentis] had a total of seven stages to
          master.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, rather than the complete mastery of the technique, the
          system instead rewarded him with knowledge about all seven stages and
          how he could train and progress through them.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the materials he would need, all the environments he might
          require, and the added conditions for using the technique were
          provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had received all of this information rather than the already
          mastered technique. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          This meant one thing: that the technique Evelyn had managed to learn,
          the first level of the divine sword arts, after its value was
          increased tenfold by the system, only amounted to the knowledge of the
          [Neglegentis] technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which essentially meant that the system had determined that the
          tenfold reward would only amount to this much. Usually, he would have
          been rewarded with a fully mastered technique ingrained in his muscles
          and memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was used to being handed power on a silver platter; this time, it
          seemed the system was nudging him toward a more difficult, but perhaps
          more rewarding, path.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this time, the only thing he received was intensive knowledge
          about this mysterious Abyssal Art [Neglegentis], which surprised him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But nonetheless, since he had already received the full knowledge of
          the Abyssal Art, he did not mind. It was an extremely comprehensive
          sword art focused on the negative energy of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each strike from [Neglegentis] is like the concentrated force of a
          collapsing star, dense with destructive potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, just as its name suggests, the technique was derived from a
          dwarf star.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the information he received, he even got the exact space
          coordinates of the dwarf star.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is part of the constellation of the Trident. It appears in the
          North Quadrant at right ascension 19h 91.41m and declination 31°
          98.86'.
        </p>
        <p>'Well…'</p>
        <p>
          He doubted if this information would ever be useful to him, so he did
          not focus much on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "According to the technique, it requires me to not only forge my own
          sword but also grow it while mastering the art…"
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of forging and growing a weapon of his own, one that would
          evolve with him, sent a thrill of anticipation through him.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Stage 1 is called Initiation of the Voidborn. The materials it
          requires are Void Crystal Shards…'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Void Crystal Shards… are basically remnants of shattered stars, found
          in the deepest voids of space. They are infused with primordial
          darkness.'
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's basically impossible for me to get such a thing. The first stage
          is insane."
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, it would have been impossible if an alternative hadn't been
          provided. According to it, a material called Void Dust can also be
          used as a replacement. This Void Dust could be collected from ancient
          meteorites that have drifted through the void of space for a certain
          period of time. These dust particles carry a faint trace of the void's
          negative energy and are easier to obtain and handle compared to the
          shards.'
        </p>
        <p>"I think I can find some on the auction market."</p>
        <p>Oliver pondered with a deep look on his face.</p>
        <p>
          His mind was already racing, strategizing on how to acquire the
          necessary materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Interestingly enough, even the environment required for completing
          the first stage is something impossible for the current me to obtain."
        </p>
        <p>
          "However, since it's like this, I can adapt another environment that I
          can find here. A moonless night—the initiation must take place under
          the cover of a moonless night, where darkness is at its peak. I would
          need to meditate in an open space; the stillness of the night will
          help me sync my mind with the negative energy in the surroundings."
        </p>
        <p>"Hahaha," Oliver suddenly laughed aloud as he looked at the sky.</p>
        <p>
          The absurdity of the situation struck him—a boy, standing on the
          precipice of cosmic power, laughing under a sky indifferent to his
          ambitions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had information about the later stages as well and knew just how
          absurd the environment would need to be in the future to master this
          sword art.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Such a terrifying power…" he said to himself, looking at his hand as
          a smartphone appeared in his grasp.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 192 &nbsp;Old Bid? Exorcists and the normal humans!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 192</p>
        <p>
          Opening the phone, he browsed through the auction market to search for
          Void Dust, but he could not find any, which made him frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          His brows knitted together as frustration simmered beneath the
          surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Strange, there's no way the exorcists don't have it, but it looks
          like it's not available at the moment. Hmm?" His voice was a low
          murmur, as if speaking the words aloud might somehow bring the elusive
          material to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He eventually submitted a post, asking for sellers willing to trade
          Void Dust with him.
        </p>
        <p>After that, he noticed a notification and opened it.</p>
        <p>[User YellowSnowman has outbid you. Amount: 10 million Neden.]</p>
        <p>
          A flash of irritation crossed his face as his eyes narrowed at the
          screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes widened slightly, and he clicked his tongue in annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>[User YellowSnowman has outbid you. Amount: 10 million Neden.]</p>
        <p>[Non-flammable Geoloril]</p>
        <p>[Current Price: 10 million Neden]</p>
        <p>[Time left: 2 months, 5 days]</p>

        <p>[Bid? Yes/No]</p>
        <p>"Hmm, YellowSnowman? He's also interested in this metal?"</p>
        <p>
          "Well, I'll place one last bid before calling it quits. I only have 20
          million Neden; I can't compete with this guy right now. Not to
          mention, I don't want to owe Jenna either. So… one last bid."
        </p>
        <p>[Yes]</p>
        <p>[11 million Neden! You have outbid user YellowSnowman!]</p>
        <p>
          [Bid placed successfully! Notifications will be sent directly to your
          inbox!]
        </p>
        <p>
          A sense of satisfaction washed over him as he saw the confirmation,
          but it was tempered by the knowledge that this could escalate further.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, he searched for the next important thing: finding some
          clues about the city of Harlington—more specifically, about the cursed
          playground.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fingers moved quickly over the screen, driven by a mix of
          determination and curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scrolling through some articles, he found some news about the place.
        </p>
        <p>The city of Harlington.</p>
        <p>
          It was a city that was not too close to the capital but not
          underdeveloped either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its streets were likely bustling with life, yet it existed on the
          periphery of the more significant happenings in the country.
        </p>
        <p>It could be classified as a tier-2 city by normal standards.</p>

        <p>
          The city functioned normally, with barely any exorcists in the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, exorcists weren't allowed to wander into normal human cities,
          causing chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          The delicate balance between normalcy and the supernatural had to be
          maintained, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only by obtaining a special permit from the Exorcist Union could
          exorcists be allowed into normal cities and towns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Exorcist Union had strictly issued guidelines stating that
          exorcists were nothing more than guards, soldiers who would protect
          the human race from extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least, to the normal humans living in the cities, that was what was
          portrayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The normal humans, born without espera or anything else, were
          considered the ones to progress the human race further in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, this did not mean that the exorcists were not considered at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>In fact, the boundaries were quite well defined.</p>
        <p>Normal humans were typically considered "preserved" specimens.</p>
        <p>
          Yes, to the average exorcist, normal humans were a sort of guarantee
          that would ensure their race never went extinct. A safeguard, should
          the frontlines ever falter, ensuring humanity's continued survival.
        </p>
        <p>
          This meant that while exorcists would carry forth the legacy of
          humanity in future generations, the well-protected normal humans were
          considered the last resort.
        </p>
        <p>A last resort in case an all-out war consumed everything.</p>
        <p>
          It was clear that exorcists must take down demons if they were to be
          eradicated forever.
        </p>

        <p>
          Preserving their species in safe cities and towns was something that
          had been planned out since ancient times and had been followed ever
          since.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cities and other territories were considered sanctuaries for
          humanity to grow and prosper while the exorcists at the borders fended
          off the demons, keeping them safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a fragile peace, one that relied on the constant vigilance of
          the exorcists and the isolation of the normal humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, this led to some disputes, but in the end, everything had
          worked out so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Exorcist Union placed special emphasis on keeping the relationship
          with normal humans as simple as possible. They did not want a war to
          break out between humans over one side being incited against the other
          for having espera and being exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why it was necessary for exorcists in normal cities and
          places to maintain a proper and good reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A single misstep could lead to widespread panic, or worse, a rebellion
          against those who were meant to protect them.
        </p>
        <p>This had been extremely effective over time.</p>
        <p>
          After all, exorcists were still humans—humans with espera. It would be
          strange for them not to mingle and coexist together.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this was also why the Mystic Purge Clan was so infamous and
          frowned upon by some exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mystic Purge Clan was a clan that cared about nothing other than
          hunting as many demons as possible. They neither cared about
          reputation nor the beliefs a proper exorcist should hold.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were indifferent, cold, and cruel—even to their own comrades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their methods were ruthless, prioritizing results over relationships,
          leaving a trail of fear and respect in their wake.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, they were one of the strongest clans, and their strength
          spoke for them. Their actions had never been against humanity from the
          beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of their moves, tactics, and everything else were for the sake of
          humanity. If any clan were to fit the definition of proper,
          disciplined, and unforgiving guards of humanity, then everyone would
          speak of only one name.
        </p>
        <p>The Mystic Purge Clan.</p>
        <p>
          The clan that fit this term the most—the bloodthirsty hounds, the
          barrier that threatened to consume any enemy if they dared step close
          to human lands.
        </p>
        <p>
          A force of nature, relentless in their pursuit, their very name was
          enough to strike fear into the hearts of those who knew of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why, while some held unfavorable opinions of the clan, more
          admired them as heroes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, it was clear that exorcists were not permitted to wander
          in normal human places without a proper pass from the Union, lest it
          caused chaos.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 193 &nbsp;Ophelia's motive?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 193</p>
        <p>
          Once the permit was obtained, exorcists could visit normal human
          places and even establish businesses there with some documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, no one actually dared to stay there for too long due to the
          countless complications that accompanied it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, they were still exorcists, and their main duty was to
          exorcise all evil.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but the normal human areas lacked the espera density
          found in places where most exorcists resided, not to mention the
          abundant resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quite disadvantageous for an exorcist to remain in normal areas
          for too long.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the city of Harlington was just a regular city without exorcists
          there to monitor it and any happenings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver purchased a detailed map of the city, which cost him around 30
          Neden, which he paid without batting an eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterwards, he started making some plans about how he was going to
          approach the situation and the possible dangers as well. His mind
          raced, calculating the risks and strategies, trying to anticipate
          every possible outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, his main goal was not to spend too much time on these
          missions but to further his own growth away from the watchful eyes of
          the clan—especially a certain someone.
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>In the Mystic Purge Clan's Grand Courtyard</p>
        <p>
          A woman with ashen gray hair and piercing cold silver eyes was
          standing, staring at the sky.
        </p>

        <p>
          The air around her was still, almost unnaturally so, as if nature
          itself hesitated in her presence.
        </p>
        <p>There was an unexpected scene taking place at the moment.</p>
        <p>
          The clan was covered in gray clouds, an eerie atmosphere looming over
          their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the whole clan was covered by a blanket of clouds, the sky above
          the grand courtyard was shining bright, devoid of a single cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stark contrast seemed almost like a defiance of nature, a silent
          proclamation of the power within the courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman was none other than Ophelia, her face like a piece of still
          art, without a change in expression as she kept staring into the empty
          sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gaze was cold, detached, as if she were searching for something
          far beyond the clouds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hands were carrying a paper umbrella that looked delicate, as if
          it would break with a single touch. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>After a moment of uneasy silence, she muttered to herself.</p>
        <p>"His destiny shifted again."</p>
        <p>"Again?"</p>
        <p>
          A voice sounded out from behind her, and looking back, there was a
          woman kneeling on the ground before her in an extremely respectful
          posture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman's head was bowed low, her breath barely a whisper in the
          vast courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>"My lady, may I be bold enough to speak?"</p>
        <p>
          The kneeling woman had short black hair and black eyes and looked
          extremely beautiful. She was wearing a formal uniform and white
          gloves. Her white uniform had a peculiar symbol of a cube-like object
          colored ominously on the pocket above her heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ophelia didn't reply, but the kneeling woman understood and said in a
          low tone, "This constant and continuous change in destiny is an
          indication of a singularity. If it continues, it might lead to…"
        </p>
        <p>
          She paused, leaving her sentence unfinished as she looked at Ophelia's
          back. The silence stretched on, heavy with unspoken implications.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was not a single change in Ophelia's expression; she looked like
          a robot.
        </p>
        <p>
          She observed the sky for a few more moments before extending her free
          hand towards it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her fingers moved with deliberate grace, as if touching something only
          she could see.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kneeling woman watched eagerly and keenly as Ophelia's slender
          fingers bent and pointed towards the sky, nowhere in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her cold, devoid eyes watched as the world distorted before her,
          revealing things unseen by anyone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her fingers stayed pointed towards the sky for a moment before she put
          her hand down without much change in her expression.
        </p>
        <p>However, the woman kneeling behind her spoke up.</p>
        <p>"My lady, did you interfere with his destiny?"</p>
        <p>
          Her voice was trembling as she looked at Ophelia's back with a
          reverent gaze, barely controlling herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Adoration and awe warred within her, a testament to the power her
          mistress wielded so effortlessly.
        </p>
        <p>"An unexpected variable."</p>
        <p>
          Ophelia spoke up, her voice cold and deadly, as if she was fiddling
          with something insignificant. There was an eerie detachment in her
          tone, as if she were merely adjusting the pieces on a chessboard.
        </p>

        <p>An obstacle that she simply tampered with a flick of her finger.</p>
        <p>
          "My lady—no, Mistress Ophelia, I am in awe of your unfathomable
          power."
        </p>
        <p>
          She bowed deeply before her, almost prostrating. Her forehead nearly
          touched the cold stone floor, a gesture of absolute submission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia didn't turn around, and her gaze remained affixed to the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman in uniform didn't move a bit from her kneeling stance
          either. She remained perfectly still, like a statue carved from
          reverence and fear.
        </p>
        <p>It was only after some time that Ophelia spoke up once again.</p>
        <p>"What about that?"</p>
        <p>
          Her tone was as cold as before, not a shred of warmth audible in her
          voice as she addressed the woman behind her. Each word fell like a
          drop of icy water, freezing the air between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My lady, I have prepared a detailed report about it." The woman
          paused momentarily before her eyes turned sharp. "It is as you
          expected; she is indeed connected to him."
        </p>
        <p>
          The black-haired woman clicked her fingers as a stack of papers
          floated in front of her before heading slowly towards Ophelia, who
          finally stopped staring at the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          The papers floated before her, and one glance was all it took before
          the papers disappeared as if they were never there in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          She managed to read them in an instant—less than a second. A feat that
          spoke volumes about the unnatural power she possessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The very next moment, an aura unlike any other descended upon the
          courtyard—a force so terrifying that the air itself seemed to shudder
          in response. The once serene environment transformed into a scene of
          utter devastation as the ground quaked violently. Rocks, trees, and
          even the very earth beneath them were mercilessly crushed under the
          unimaginable pressure. The aura was not just powerful; it was
          apocalyptic, a dark and primal force that defied the natural order.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if the entire world had been plunged into an abyss.</p>

        <p>Creator's Thought</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Chapter 194 &nbsp;Ophelia's orders!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 194</p>
        <p>
          It was as if the entire world had been plunged into an abyss so deep
          that no light or hope could ever reach it. The weight of it was
          suffocating, pressing down with such ferocity that the very fabric of
          reality seemed to strain under the burden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shadows twisted and coiled, as if alive, writhing in response to the
          overwhelming force.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sky darkened as if consumed by her power, and a chilling wind
          swept through the courtyard, howling with a voice that spoke of
          ancient, unfathomable dread.
        </p>
        <p>
          The aura was unbelievably dark and powerful, almost threatening to
          consume the entire world beneath it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The black-haired woman trembled as she lowered her head, not daring to
          speak at that moment. Her body instinctively reacted to the
          overwhelming force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every muscle in her body tensed, instinctively bracing against the
          crushing pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not dare to look up, not even for a fleeting glance. The
          pressure could have easily annihilated any ordinary exorcist, reducing
          them to mere dust and echoes of what once was. Yet, she remained
          unfazed, grounded by her absolute loyalty and unyielding resolve,
          though the effort it took to maintain her composure was monumental.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her breath came in shallow, controlled measures, the only indication
          of the immense strain she was under.
        </p>
        <p>"His existence is necessary."</p>
        <p>
          Ophelia emphasized each word she spoke—or at least that's how it
          seemed. There was a chilling finality in her tone, as if the very
          universe would bend to her will.
        </p>

        <p>
          The black-haired woman kneeling could sense a twisted obsession her
          mistress was harboring behind her words, an obsession that clung to
          Ophelia like a shadow, dark and insidious. It was not an obsession
          born out of love or care, but something sinister and terrifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having been with her lady for as long as she could remember, she knew
          Ophelia better than anyone. She could read the subtle shifts in her
          mistress's voice, the undercurrents of thought that were invisible to
          others.
        </p>
        <p>She was certain of it just from the tone of her voice.</p>
        <p>
          Ever since Ophelia had met him after the demon hunt, many changes had
          occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could sense Ophelia's dark obsession with Oliver growing, like a
          storm gathering on the horizon, inevitable and destructive. The air
          around Ophelia seemed to hum with latent energy whenever Oliver was
          mentioned, a telltale sign of the tempest brewing within her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to know what it was that her lady wanted to use her son
          for, but she never asked, knowing that no answer would be given.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was there to follow the orders her master gave her, no matter
          what. Ophelia's words were her commands, and her existence depended on
          her lady.
        </p>
        <p>She knew, after all, that…</p>
        <p>There was no demon or human stronger than her lady.</p>
        <p>
          That knowledge was both a comfort and a curse, binding her to a fate
          she could not escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was aware of the great plan that her lady had been preparing ever
          since her daughter, the young miss Nadia, was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          But after meeting Oliver, many shifts had taken place in those plans.
        </p>

        <p>
          The black-haired woman could tell that whenever she mentioned anything
          related to young master Oliver, she could expect a strong response or
          emotion from her lady, who rarely expressed anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her eyes, which considered everything insignificant, only Oliver
          and Nadia could interest her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their names alone could provoke the faintest flicker of emotion in
          Ophelia's otherwise icy demeanor.
        </p>
        <p>
          She, someone who could bend the world to her will, placed importance
          on two children?
        </p>
        <p>
          She had an inkling as to why Nadia was the chosen one, but she could
          not understand why her lady had suddenly selected Oliver as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew that being born alongside the chosen one, he was supposed to
          serve a specific purpose and was thus left alive at that time. But
          now, it looked as if things had changed, and her lady had placed far
          more significance on him.
        </p>
        <p>"Investigate her and his connection to her."</p>
        <p>
          She said a few ambiguous words, but the black-haired woman immediately
          understood and nodded. The aura instantly vanished as if it had never
          existed in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The courtyard felt unnaturally still in the wake of the oppressive
          force, as if reality itself was catching its breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Enter his life, observe every detail. Should he show signs of opening
          the path, report back."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Understood, my lady. I shall thoroughly investigate the woman called
          Jenna Sullivan and her connection to young master Oliver."
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia didn't turn around as the kneeling black-haired woman bowed
          once more before disappearing into mist. The mist swirled where she
          had been, dissipating slowly, leaving no trace of her presence.
        </p>

        <p>Oliver was unaware that such a scene had taken place.</p>
        <p>It seemed that Ophelia was slowly tightening her grip on him…</p>
        <p>
          He was leaving the clan to escape her, but was that really going to
          help him in the end?
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>"Achoo!"</p>
        <p>Oliver sneezed, startling the cat sitting snugly on his lap.</p>
        <p>"Sorry about that, Zippy," he said, apologizing to the cat.</p>
        <p>"Meow! Meow!"</p>
        <p>
          The cat nodded as if forgiving him and rested her head against his
          chest as she closed her eyes once again.
        </p>
        <p>Her purring vibrated softly against his chest.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her with a hint of speechlessness in his eyes. The
          clan guardian was really dense; after all, what cat would nod at their
          owner while responding to what he said?
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, the cat was quite heavy.</p>
        <p>
          He could probably replace her with his training weights and still get
          some exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          He chuckled at the thought, imagining himself doing push-ups with the
          grumpy cat perched on his back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, Sesha had been doing well in monitoring her growth. The
          cat seemed less fat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later that evening, Oliver visited the eastern area of the clan, which
          he had never been to before.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the place where the administrative work of the clan would take
          place before being sent to the central residential area for the
          involved elders' opinions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was also the place where the exorcists of the clan would be
          assigned missions and special requests.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 195 &nbsp;At the administrative center of the clan!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 195</p>
        <p>
          It was also the place where the exorcists of the clan would be
          assigned missions and special requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          One might question why the exorcists were required to carry out
          missions as part of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then again, money is a huge factor involved, though that's not
          all. Duty and discipline were equally significant, binding each
          exorcist to their responsibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          These missions were all related to the state of the human world, all
          aimed at maintaining human lands. These missions were less of an order
          and more collections of requests made specifically to the Mystic Purge
          Clan exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mission or request—each exorcist had their own term for referring
          to it—could range from anything to anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be it violent demon clashes at the border, attacks by heretics, or
          finding something like an artifact or a treasure. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot
          c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          All of them were requested from the powerful exorcists of the Mystic
          Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was evident from the numerous requests piling up that the clan had
          to filter through, showing how much people valued and trusted the
          skills of the Mystic Purge Clan. Each request was a silent show to the
          clan's ironclad reputation and the desperate hope of those who sought
          their aid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the name of the clan alone could strike fear into the hearts of
          demons. Whispers of their name traveled far and wide, carried on the
          wind like a warning.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cruel, strict, and disciplined clan had been an ancient guardian
          of humanity, protecting it from the demons on the other side of the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their vigilance was unyielding, their presence a deterrent to the
          darkness that lurked beyond human borders. It did provide those living
          behind a warm sense of comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan was associated with power and a very high rate of perfectly
          completed tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their success was not merely a record; it was a legacy, carved into
          the annals of history with blood and steel.
        </p>
        <p>So it was no shock that there were so many requests.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was there to find a particular elder who would be assigning him
          a mission, as per the details he had, but now, looking at the noisy
          surroundings, he felt he would need to ask someone to help him find
          that elder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he was currently covering his hair and a major portion of
          his face with the cloak of darkness. Other than making his presence
          vanish, it also had the normal function of dimming his presence in
          such gatherings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cloak's fabric seemed to absorb light, rendering him a mere shadow
          among the bustling crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he dared to brazenly show his face around this area, he could
          imagine the chaos it would cause, considering how a main heir had
          personally visited the administrative branch without any escorts.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be like a stone dropped into still water, creating ripples of
          shock and speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had left without informing Sesha. He did so to avoid her
          accompanying him. Now that she was his personal maid, it was not
          strange that she would insist on such matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Normally, every heir had their own escort, whose duty was to maintain
          the heir's safety and fulfill their needs in daily life.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, Oliver did not trust that maid of his one bit and thus would
          never accept her as his escort.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought of relying on someone who had ulterior motives was
          repugnant to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing an escort was an important matter considering they would be
          sharing a lifetime with you. It becomes even more necessary for them
          to be trustworthy. There was no way he would be willing to accept
          Sesha, a spy, as his escort.
        </p>
        <p>
          That would be too ridiculous, after all. Well, he had a lot of time to
          decide on an escort for future events.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea weighed on him, but he pushed it aside, focusing on the task
          at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he was contemplating and observing his surroundings, he noticed a
          small commotion taking place at the entrance from where he had come.
        </p>
        <p>
          He briskly walked towards the area and saw a group of exorcists
          dressed in pitch-black uniforms bearing the symbol of the Mystic Purge
          Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were official exorcists of the clan, and at the moment, they were
          in a group of five, heading towards the counter where an elder was
          scrambling with missions and papers.
        </p>
        <p>He heard whispers around the crowd about the group of five.</p>
        <p>
          He focused on the whispers and gradually understood what the commotion
          was about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently, the group before them was a famous exorcist team
          consisting of powerful exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did they hold an extremely potent reputation, but they also
          induced fear and awe in the crowds wherever they went. Their very
          presence seemed to cast an invisible force, as if they carried with
          them the weight of countless battles.
        </p>

        <p>The commotion was about the recent deed they had accomplished.</p>
        <p>
          "Did you know? It's a hot piece of news. After the insolent act of
          targeting the major clans' heirs, the Unholy Sun Sect was hunted madly
          by the forces of the five clans, and from our clan, their group
          contributed the most. I heard they managed to take down five of the
          Unholy Sun Sect's saints on their own."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Serves them right; they had it coming. To be so daring as to
          challenge the great clans? They were simply seeking death." The
          speaker's voice was tinged with satisfaction, as if justice had been
          served.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Humph. I heard that a majority of their bases have also been taken
          down, and all the heretics were brutally exorcised."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, yes. They would not be offered a chance for redemption after
          performing such a stunt. The clans will definitely be rewarding the
          participants of the hunt with great rewards."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, I was so busy that I could not take part in it. I am envious…"
        </p>
        <p>Oliver heard and sorted the murmurs calmly.</p>
        <p>
          So, the Unholy Sun Sect had already been destroyed to such a degree in
          such a short amount of time?
        </p>
        <p>
          The efficiency and ruthlessness of the clans were impressive, if not
          unsettling.
        </p>
        <p>
          He expected nothing less of the influence of the clans. No matter how
          deeply these heretics were hiding, the forces of the clans still
          managed to sniff them out easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the clans were using the Unholy Sun Sect to set an
          example for other active heretics, warning them not to dare to look at
          the heirs of their clan ever again in the future.

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Chapter 196 &nbsp;The unreasonably loyal woman!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 196</p>
        <p>
          The clans were using the Unholy Sun Sect to set an example for other
          active heretics, warning them not to dare to look at the heirs of
          their clan ever again in the future.
        </p>
        <p>It was an effective move.</p>
        <p>
          But Oliver knew that the sect master of the Unholy Sun Sect was not
          someone who could be easily found… he was probably still hiding away
          from the prying eyes of the clans, a dangerous heretic lurking in the
          shadows, biding his time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, given the fact that he knew the disaster beast egg was in the
          hands of some exorcist, there was no way he would let himself be
          exorcised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver turned his head and looked at the group of exorcists who had
          contributed the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          The small group consisted of three men and two women. All of them were
          dressed in proper uniforms, and from his angle, a tall man seemed to
          be the leader of the group by the way he moved forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was an air of authority about him, his movements sharp and
          decisive, marking him as someone used to command.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their movements were well-defined and coordinated, even in such a
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as Oliver was staring at them, one of the two women in the group
          turned around and looked in his direction.
        </p>
        <p>It was at that moment when their eyes suddenly met.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver quietly withdrew his gaze since the woman had already seen him.
          He kept his expression neutral, though a flicker of curiosity stirred
          within him.
        </p>
        <p>It might look rude to the other party, after all.</p>
        <p>
          However, even though he had retracted his gaze, he could still feel
          her eyes fixed on him.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was an unsettling sensation, as if she were peeling back layers to
          see what lay beneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          To confirm his suspicions, he moved around, away from the group, but
          he could still feel her gaze following him. Each step felt heavier
          under the weight of her unyielding attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unable to bear it any longer, he looked back and met her eyes once
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes seemed to question why she was so insistently staring at him,
          but the other party did not show much reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her face remained impassive, her gaze steady, as if she were trying to
          decipher a puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver shook his head and decided to leave for the moment and look
          around for the person he was supposed to receive the mission from.
        </p>
        <p>As he left the premises, the gaze also vanished from his back.</p>
        <p>
          Just when he thought he had finally managed to shake her off, he was
          blocked by a tall shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking up, it was the same woman who had been staring at him earlier,
          and now she was blocking his path.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is it?" he asked in a calm voice. He kept his tone measured,
          hiding the irritation that simmered beneath the surface.
        </p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          The woman kept staring at him under the hood as he looked back at her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her features were striking, with long brown hair and green eyes full
          of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, the woman kneeled on one knee before him and said in a
          resolute voice, "Young master," she looked at him, "Why are you here
          alone without your escort?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her tone indicated a level of respect that she bore towards the main
          family, not particularly towards Oliver but towards his status
          instead.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was the kind of respect ingrained through years of discipline and
          tradition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, she used the term because she was not aware of who he was
          out of the many heirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          An heir walking around without any escort was not only unsafe but also
          quite disrespectful to themselves as well, generally.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was not the central or residential area of the clan, and walking
          around without any escort was not looked upon lightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did escorts show off the heir's potential with their
          strength—the stronger the escort, the more precious the heir was to
          the clan—but they also demonstrated the ability of the heir to command
          such a person.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, right now, he had other things to deal with.</p>
        <p>
          "I am here secretly, no one knows of it," he told her simply. His
          words were clipped, trying to convey the finality of the matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This… young master, if the elders learn of this, they will be
          furious."
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman wore a complicated expression as if not knowing what to say.
          Her brows furrowed slightly, concern etched in her features.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They won't know as long as you don't open your mouth. Moreover, I
          have a reason to be here too. Once the matter is settled, there will
          be no issues."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver glanced at the woman. To be able to find his identity just by
          looking at him once—he didn't know how she did that—but since she
          could see through the cloak of darkness, it must mean she was quite
          powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made a mental note to remember her, someone with such sharp
          perception would be valuable, or dangerous, depending on the
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Young master, forgive me for being bold, but after the recent attack
          on Young Master Oliver by the heretic sect, you should not be careless
          when there's an increased risk of retaliation from the remaining
          forces of those heretics."
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman spoke with a tone of hidden disgust. Her lip curled slightly
          as she mentioned the heretics, her disdain barely concealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My team and I have been actively exorcising these pests; however,
          they are quite tenacious and good at hiding. It is best not to be
          careless even within the clan."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her words implied that even she, who was stronger than him, would not
          underestimate those heretics easily, and he must not do so at any cost
          either.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright, I will keep your words in mind," he said, since he could
          tell she was very loyal to the clan just from the strain in her voice.
          There was a sternness in her tone that spoke of her dedication, a
          trait he couldn't help but respect, even if only slightly.
        </p>
        <p>"I will leave as soon as I am done," he told her.</p>
        <p>
          "Young master, if I may ask something..." she interrupted as she
          looked at him trying to meet his eyes through the fabric of cloak.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Chapter 197 &nbsp;Was there really a guardian? Alison's suspicion!
        </h2>
        <p>Chapter 197</p>
        <p>
          "What does the young master wish to accomplish? Please tell me. With
          my influence here, it would be completed instantly," she spoke up. Of
          course, she did not mean to boast about her influence in front of an
          heir, but since the said heir was in disguise right now, she was
          suggesting using her reputation to have his work done quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "After that, I will personally escort the young master back to the
          central area," she said in a serious voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver inwardly shook his head. This woman was quite persistent. She
          was insistent on sending him back no matter what, for some reason. It
          was as if her sense of duty was etched into her very soul, overriding
          any consideration for his autonomy.
        </p>
        <p>What sort of unreasonable loyalty was this?</p>
        <p>
          'Come to think of it, she must have already been brainwashed by the
          clan.'
        </p>
        <p>
          As if he remembered something, his gaze turned subtle. The clan was
          infamous for employing the cruelest of means to achieve what they
          wanted for the sake of humanity, even if those actions included
          forsaking the very thing they sought to protect.
        </p>
        <p>A bitter irony that was not lost on him.</p>
        <p>
          The methods of the clan were among the worst. All the official
          exorcists and members of the clan were deeply loyal, their hearts and
          minds engraved with devotion to the clan—even if it meant sacrificing
          their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The severe principles and training they underwent were all intended to
          completely brainwash the members into being solely devoted to the
          clan's prosperity and progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cost of such loyalty was a terrifying efficiency, coupled with a
          complete disregard for personal freedom.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I have already said that it is a private matter. I do not need your
          assistance, and I believe you will keep this matter under wraps," he
          said in a firm tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman didn't even flinch under Oliver's gaze and calmly closed her
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her composure was unnerving, as if she were a stone statue, unyielding
          and cold.
        </p>
        <p>"I understand, young master."</p>
        <p>She nodded once and got up, leaving him alone shortly after.</p>
        <p>
          'Damn, now I need to hurry up. She's definitely going to snitch on
          me.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyelids twitched as he watched her fading back. He knew for
          sure that she was going to inform the elders from the clan as soon as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elders would naturally not let a young heir accept any missions or
          requests easily, no matter how much he insisted. Plus, there was a
          risk that they would let Ophelia know about it too.
        </p>
        <p>
          He dared not imagine what she would do after that, given how she
          reacted after the demon hunt just by seeing his espera.
        </p>
        <p>She was crazy.</p>
        <p>
          "Now, where in the world is that person supposed to be?" He glanced
          around and moved in a certain direction to inquire about him.
        </p>
        <p>____________</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, back at the mountains:</p>

        <p>
          Alison was deep in thought as she looked at the terrain before her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It doesn't make sense." Her voice was a soft murmur, almost drowned
          out by the silence of the wilderness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since the heretic attack, she had been seriously investigating
          the traces and remains of the battle that transpired.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Oliver had told her, there was a masked man who had jumped in to
          help them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could very well be a secret guardian from one of the clans
          responsible for protecting the heirs. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          She had been trying to uncover the truth, knowing there was more than
          what met the eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if it was a guardian, there was no reason for them not to meet
          her and then disappear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, there was something even more suspicious in this case: Oliver's
          nonchalant behavior, the confusion among the children, and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a fairly dangerous poison…" Her fingers traced the charred
          ground, feeling the residual energy still clinging to the earth.
        </p>
        <p>She bent down and traced her finger on the charred ground.</p>
        <p>
          This was the place where Oliver fought with the old man who was using
          poison.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could detect faint traces of dark espera and poison still
          lingering from the aftermath of the battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison's senses were sharpened to the extreme, especially when it came
          to tracing such espera outputs.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her eyes narrowed, focusing intently on the faint remnants, piecing
          together the scene in her mind.
        </p>
        <p>"But…" She frowned as she looked ahead.</p>
        <p>"Why are there traces of Oliver's espera only here?"</p>
        <p>
          She looked at the destruction ahead with a dazed expression. The
          ground was literally obliterated as if someone had forcefully
          destroyed it, and there were no visible signs of corrosion from the
          poison either.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if a concentrated blast had wiped out everything, leaving no
          trace of the poison's typical lingering effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oliver had the water element as far as I know, but clearly, from the
          charred state of the ground, a variant of the fire element was used in
          this."
        </p>
        <p>
          She pondered, "But as he said, there was a masked man helping them
          out. Then he should have left some espera traces, and there's no way I
          would miss them. However, there's absolutely nothing other than
          Oliver's faint espera signature."
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm…" Her brow furrowed deeper, the mystery gnawing at her.</p>
        <p>
          "How can there be no traces of the heretic's espera? It's as if they
          have vanished out of existence itself!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought sent a chill down her spine, the implications unsettling.
        </p>
        <p>She narrowed her eyes and made a bold guess.</p>
        <p>'Could it be that Oliver was lying…?'</p>
        <p>
          Her heart raced at that possibility, since if what she thought was
          true, then there was only one possible scenario that could have
          happened when the heretics attacked.
        </p>
        <p>'He defeated them alone!'</p>
        <p>
          This was an absurd statement that even she herself would never believe
          if someone said that to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had just entered Rank-1, and the heretics who attacked were
          clearly Rank-2 by all means.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially Jetia, one of the saints, who was strong enough to be
          categorized as Rank-3.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did find the traces of two heretics out of the four who attacked,
          but she could not understand why the traces of the other two had
          disappeared like that.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 198 &nbsp;Leaving the clan!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 198</p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but she had also concluded that one of the heretics was
          not dead but had escaped due to unknown circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gut instinct, honed by years of experience, told her that this
          situation was far from ordinary.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there was really a strong guardian protecting the kids from the
          shadows, then there was no way they would have let one of those
          heretics escape, further convincing her that something was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew for sure that the heretic was still alive; she had the
          ability to tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had sent Sigfor to look for her as his punishment for being
          careless.
        </p>
        <p>So far, there had been no reports from his end.</p>
        <p>
          She stroked her chin, deep in thought. Oliver had always been a bit of
          an oddball ever since he came under her care.
        </p>
        <p>
          From having mysterious means to veil his espera to a strange
          resistance to the fire element, something was definitely amiss here.
        </p>
        <p>
          And she believed it was definitely linked to him in one way or
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would have to investigate in depth to know exactly what was going
          on.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come to think of it, I still owe the two their apology gifts from
          that time."
        </p>

        <p>
          Her lips curled into a faint smile as she remembered her promise when
          she had accidentally thrown the sword-wielding kid.
        </p>
        <p>"A great chance to meet up with him again."</p>
        <p>
          "What should I gift that little student who seems to be hiding
          important stuff from his teacher? Hmm?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison fell into thought with a small smirk tugging at her soft lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, young master, here is the mission request and the badge to allow
          you special entry on behalf of the clan."
        </p>
        <p>
          A middle-aged man handed Oliver the mission details and the special
          badge that was used to prove both his identity as an exorcist from the
          Mystic Purge Clan and to allow him to leave the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          "However, young master…" The middle-aged man paused, looking at
          Oliver's hidden face, and said, "Are you sure you want to do this?
          There are many risks involved, and if…"
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't continue, but the meaning behind his words was clear: if
          this matter reached the ears of someone higher up, all of them would
          be in trouble.
        </p>
        <p>"Don't worry, I've decided."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver reassured him and got up, ready to leave. That woman might have
          already reached out to an elder by now; he should leave before they
          arrived.
        </p>
        <p>"Also, young master, here…"</p>
        <p>
          The middle-aged man stopped him momentarily and handed him a talisman.
        </p>
        <p>"This is…?" Oliver looked at the talisman in doubt and asked.</p>

        <p>
          "This is something prepared by Miss. She asked me to hand it to you
          before you leave. If you encounter any danger threatening your life,
          just use this talisman. As for its use, she didn't tell me."
        </p>
        <p>
          The middle-aged man smiled awkwardly, but Oliver nodded and thanked
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Afterward, he quickly made his way back to his courtyard and prepared
          to depart.
        </p>
        <p>
          Packing up, he quickly sorted out the essential materials in his
          Mindspace and then strode out of his courtyard casually.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could see Sesha tortu—training the fat white cat and walked past
          them as if he was going out for a stroll.
        </p>
        <p>
          None of them reacted much upon seeing him, since he was wearing casual
          clothes and had nothing on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was normal for him to visit the market a few times a week, so they
          both did not suspect anything and continued what they were doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had no intention of letting the two know his whereabouts, or
          else they might start following him and eventually learn his secrets.
        </p>
        <p>
          After making sure he had left the central area behind, he took out the
          same old white faceless mask, put it on, and headed toward the clan
          exit with brisk, hurried steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a sinking feeling in his heart, as if he was being watched.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't dare to be careless and suspected that it might be ordinary
          secret guards placed around the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his courtyard being heavily guarded, he never really allowed
          anyone to follow him anywhere, fearing being monitored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon, he reached the clan's main gate and saw multiple expensive cars
          nearby. It was clear that many exorcists knew how to drive and used
          these cars.
        </p>

        <p>
          He walked up to the buff-looking guard at the entrance and showed him
          the mission badge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guard paused, silently scanned the badge, and then scrutinized
          Oliver sharply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but feel goosebumps. The guard was dangerously
          strong, given that he was the gatekeeper. In the distance, he could
          even see some demonic beasts stationed as well.
        </p>
        <p>It was heavily guarded.</p>
        <p>"Mission?"</p>
        <p>The buff man spoke in a heavy voice.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver simply nodded and didn't speak. The guard did not ask him
          further despite the suspicious mask he was wearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was common for different exorcists to have weird tastes; an
          exorcist wearing a mask to conceal their identity was not that rare.
        </p>
        <p>"You may pass."</p>
        <p>
          The buff man handed the badge back, and the heavy metal doors that
          seemed as tall as the clouds slowly opened wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver took the chance and swiftly made his exit, finally escaping the
          clutches of his clan for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          He immediately took out a map of the clan's outer area and navigated
          toward the normal human areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was planning to book a taxi once he was a bit farther from the
          clan.
        </p>
        <p>He ran at great speed and soon left the clan behind.</p>
        <p>
          Once he was sure he had covered a considerable distance, he opened his
          smartphone and browsed through some features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently, he could book a ride if he went a little farther north,
          which would directly take him to the human cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes narrowed as he saw the ridiculous price but still booked
          it. If he were to travel on foot, it might take him months to reach
          his destination.
        </p>
        <p>A ride was faster and more comfortable.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 199 &nbsp;Reaching the human city!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 199</p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, after traveling a little further north, he spotted a
          small black car with tinted windows, making it hard to see inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sleek black exterior reflected the dim light of the overcast sky,
          giving the car an ominous presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Oliver approached the car, a woman emerged from it, looked at him,
          and then at the smartphone in her hand.
        </p>
        <p>"You are the customer?"</p>
        <p>
          "Indeed." Oliver took out his smartphone and scanned the details. The
          soft glow from his phone's screen illuminated his face, highlighting
          the intensity in his eyes as he confirmed the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          After confirming everything, she opened the door for him and got into
          the car herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well then, sir, your destination is the city of Harlington, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm." His response was curt, his focus already drifting elsewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing that he didn't seem interested in chatting, the driver quieted
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silence between them was thick, only broken by the low hum of the
          car's engine.
        </p>

        <p>"It will take approximately two days before we reach the city."</p>
        <p>
          She calmly told him and focused on driving. The car sped up extremely
          fast, but from inside, no one could feel any tremor or discomfort, as
          if the car was moving very slowly instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was unnervingly smooth, the speed betraying the lack of sensation,
          making it feel like they were gliding over the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't say anything to her and opened his phone again, starting
          to browse.
        </p>
        <p>
          'According to the article, the latest moonless night should be in the
          next five days. After that, it will appear only after seven months, so
          I need to practice and form the [Neglegentis] on that day.'
        </p>
        <p>Given his travel plans, he would have only three days to prepare.</p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, he might have to wait seven months to even consider forming
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The issue related to void dust had also been resolved when he met with
          Jenna last time. Although he was now in her debt, he really needed the
          materials, so he agreed for the time being.
        </p>
        <p>
          A slight frown crossed his face at the thought of being in her debt,
          but he quickly pushed it aside.
        </p>
        <p>At most, he might have to run an errand for her in the future.</p>
        <p>
          The rest of the journey was smooth. He half expected to be ambushed by
          thieves or bandits but realized he was overthinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paranoia from living in a world filled with constant danger had
          become second nature, always expecting the worst.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not only that, but it seemed like the clan wouldn't be able to take
          him back forcefully now—not that they had a reason to.
        </p>
        <p>
          He believed they might send someone to keep an eye on him if things
          got worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          What he was most worried about was Ophelia's reaction to him running
          away from the clan so secretly. The mere thought of her discovering
          his departure sent a chill down his spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only hope she would stay put until he gained some strength.
          He was also concerned about Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there wasn't much he could do about it; he had never been great at
          talking or maintaining relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a sister, but she was nothing like the cold block of ice Nadia
          was. Nadia's coldness seemed impenetrable, like a barrier that
          separated her from the warmth of human connection.
        </p>
        <p>'Well… I wonder how much the plot has progressed so far.'</p>
        <p>
          With Evelyn learning the first level of divine swordsmanship, she
          would be going through a clan trial, just like the one he went through
          during the demon hunt, though something different for her clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time, some elders of her clan conspired against her, and she
          was badly wounded. But, as luck would have it, she persisted and still
          won the competition in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The memory of her victory, against all odds, was vivid in his
          mind—Evelyn standing tall amidst the chaos, bloodied but unbroken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then she proceeded to humiliate the elders and their children, leading
          to a long conflict within the clan itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I have nothing to do with that." He muttered softly to himself,
          dismissing any notion of getting involved in that mess.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver felt somewhat relieved. He couldn't imagine getting involved in
          that chaotic mess. Not only had he taken up a mission request from the
          clan, but the destination was far away as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no way he could get associated with the Celestial Paradox
          Clan there.
        </p>
        <p>Suddenly, he shivered.</p>
        <p>'This…'</p>
        <p>He didn't know why, but a bad feeling came over him.</p>
        <p>
          His gut tightened, a familiar sense of foreboding creeping up his
          spine.
        </p>
        <p>'No! There's no way that can happen.'</p>
        <p>
          He forcefully shook his head and decided to focus on preparing for the
          moonless night in five days.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were too many variables to dwell on his fears now—he had to stay
          sharp.
        </p>
        <p>Well, he would only have two days to prepare.</p>
        <p>
          'I should first get a hotel to stay in, then scout for a safe place
          with no distractions… hmm.'
        </p>
        <p>He wondered if he had enough money left for the hotel stay.</p>
        <p>He seriously needed to find some ways to make money, too.</p>
        <p>
          He wasn't too worried, though. With his knowledge of the plot and now
          that he was out, he could gradually start investing in things that
          would explode exponentially in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          The future was like a chessboard laid out before him, and he knew
          exactly which moves would yield the highest returns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he was heading to the best place for it—the normal
          human cities, where things developed and worked in a predictable way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the journey was spent in silence. Oliver didn't talk and
          kept scrolling through his smartphone, looking at current affairs and
          getting a deeper understanding of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each news article and update was a piece of the puzzle, slowly
          revealing the state of the world outside the clan's control.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 200 &nbsp;Reaching the city! Getting into a hotel!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 200</p>
        <p>
          The lady wasn't an ordinary driver either. Oliver had used his special
          eyes on her before getting into the car. She had some espera in her
          body, although not as much as him, but still more than the average
          human.
        </p>
        <p>
          A faint shimmer of energy pulsed around her, barely noticeable unless
          one knew what to look for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The faint glow of her espera had caught his attention for a brief
          moment, but he dismissed it as unimportant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from taking a few breaks, they soon reached their destination:
        </p>
        <p>The city of Harlington.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at the city with interest. It was just like any modern
          city, but with more advanced technology incorporated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sleek towers of glass and steel reached into the sky, their surfaces
          glinting in the late afternoon light. The hum of machinery and the
          distant sound of traffic filled the air, a contrast to the serenity he
          had left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Towering skyscrapers loomed on the horizon, sleek and shining, a
          testament to human innovation and progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each building seemed meticulously crafted, blending both function and
          elegance, a symbol of humanity's rise in an otherwise chaotic world.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could see the tall gates at the entrance of the city. The material
          the gates were made from was not ordinary either. The gates gleamed
          under the city lights.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was clearly designed to fend off any anti-social invaders or
          heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver watched as the woman drove up to the gate and was stopped by
          the city guards, who asked her to show verification cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was also asked to show identification, but since he didn't have
          any, he decided to show the mission badge bearing the symbol of the
          Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the intricate design carved onto the surface, the guards
          were momentarily stunned before regaining their senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The delicate carvings and ancient symbols seemed to glow under the dim
          light, as if holding a power that transcended time.
        </p>
        <p>
          They quickly bowed deeply, almost at a 90-degree angle, to show the
          utmost respect. Their earlier stern expressions melted away, replaced
          by a look of awe and reverence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their bodies stiffened, as if suddenly aware of the sheer authority
          and danger that came with Oliver's rank.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sir, Sir Exorcist, please grace our town," the guard stuttered,
          speaking in a low and respectful tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice wavered, betraying the sudden shift from authority to
          deference.
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice shook slightly, betraying the intimidation he felt in the
          presence of someone from the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a clear contrast to his earlier stern expression. Even his
          posture was now straight and full of respect and attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          He seemed almost smaller now, humbled by the presence of a clan
          member, and desperate not to offend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite Oliver looking no taller than a ten-year-old, the guards dared
          not underestimate or be disrespectful to him at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          They knew a bit more than the common people—exorcists had all sorts of
          magic and tricks to alter their appearances, and it would not be
          surprising if this small-looking kid was a hundred-year-old veteran
          expert.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had heard of cases where being disrespectful to such exorcists
          would later result in the victim getting cursed or devoured by demons
          at night. No one took exorcists lightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, exorcists would never admit it, lest they draw the rage of
          the Exorcist Union.
        </p>
        <p>
          A silent code of conduct existed among the exorcists, one that
          civilians could only speculate about.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guards quickly shuffled back and forth, clearly flustered about
          what to do since they had not been informed that an exorcist would be
          visiting their small city like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The female driver was also speechless. She didn't expect her customer
          to be someone from one of the five great clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hands trembled slightly on the steering wheel as she processed the
          revelation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who would have imagined that a prestigious exorcist would hire her
          ordinary car services?
        </p>
        <p>
          If she remembered correctly, the cars in the Mystic Purge Clan were
          extremely luxurious and way more comfortable than her small car, so
          why would he hire her?
        </p>
        <p>
          It also made sense to her now why he had such an aloof temperament and
          cold aura radiating from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pieces clicked together in her mind, each interaction with him
          suddenly making more sense, though it also heightened her anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was fortunate that she hadn't blabbered much on the way, or else
          she might have mysteriously disappeared during the journey, given the
          notorious reputation of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her pulse quickened at the thought, the horror stories she had heard
          of the Mystic Purge Clan flashing through her mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          "This… sir," she fidgeted and looked at him, not knowing how to ask
          about her payment from this exorcist without coming off as
          disrespectful.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know. Find a decent hotel for me, and I will add a tip for you," he
          casually said and went back to sit inside the car, leaving behind a
          stunned driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice was casual, but there was an underlying finality to his
          words, giving her no choice but to comply.
        </p>
        <p>Now she must find a hotel for this esteemed exorcist?</p>
        <p>
          She was just a simple driver; since when was it her job to arrange for
          her customer's lodgings?
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mind raced as she considered the strange turn of events. This was
          supposed to be a simple ride, and now she was responsible for housing
          a member of one of the most dangerous clans in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt depressed, but she could not refuse the exorcist anyway.
          Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>"Well…" She sighed under her breath, resigned to her fate.</p>
        <p>
          She opened up her smartphone and browsed through the hotels suitable
          for the exorcist inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her fingers moved quickly, trying to find something that wouldn't
          insult his status.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the end, she found that the city lacked any extravagant and
          lavish hotels.
        </p>
        <p>
          She naturally assumed that someone from the Mystic Purge Clan was used
          to high-end hotels, but this city didn't seem to have any.
        </p>
        <p>
          A wave of frustration hit her. How could a city of this size not have
          anything suitable for such a high-ranking guest?
        </p>
