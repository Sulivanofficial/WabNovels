        <h2>Chapter 151 &nbsp;It's finally their turn!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 151</p>
        <p>
          Daniel could not help but feel a little overwhelmed as he stared at
          the elder, who was looking at both of them with a calm expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air seemed heavier under Sigfor's gaze, each second stretching
          into an eternity.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind worked, trying to comprehend the vast difference in their
          powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every fiber of his being was trying to understand the chasm that
          separated them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gulped, realizing how rude he might have been to such a powerful
          person.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, on second thought, the elder was indeed quite annoying, so he
          quickly discarded the growing admiration.
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head slightly, pushing away the fleeting respect.</p>
        <p>He asked the elder, "Elder, what was that move just now?"</p>
        <p>
          "It was an exorcism technique focused on destruction and offense."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Could you teach it to me!?" Daniel, who heard the elder's words,
          instantly threw everything to the back of his mind and asked with a
          pleading expression.
        </p>
        <p>His voice wavered, a mix of eagerness and desperation.</p>
        <p>His eyes shone with desperate hope.</p>
        <p>If he could learn something this powerful, then…</p>
        <p>Just imagining it made him clench his fists.</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          However, Sigfor's flat rejection instantly shattered his wild
          imaginings.
        </p>
        <p>
          "WHAT!? Why though?" He could not understand. His fists unclenched,
          frustration etched on his face.
        </p>
        <p>His face flushed with anger and confusion.</p>
        <p>
          "The technique is not suitable for your rank right now. You would need
          to have at least five times the espera you currently have to even dare
          to think of using this technique. It's just this demanding and
          destructive. Not to mention the extreme control it requires. Given
          your bearings, I would not be surprised if you blow yourself up the
          moment you try."
        </p>

        <p>
          Sigfor plainly commented, making Daniel grit his teeth. He was
          determined to learn this in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Also, your clan should have a more suitable version of this
          technique, so ask them when you return. My element does not work
          similarly to yours," he added further.
        </p>
        <p>"I understand. Can I ask the name of this technique?"</p>
        <p>"Crane Beam. Now go back to your position."</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor dismissed him quickly. His tone was final, leaving no room for
          argument.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel, having learned the name of the technique, made a note to
          himself to ask his father to teach it to him later on. Determination
          burned in his eyes as he returned to his place.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind was already planning the next steps, each one bringing him
          closer to his goal.
        </p>
        <p>___________</p>
        <p>"Next, Evelyn and Oliver, it's your turn now."</p>
        <p>Sigfor called out to them.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver and Evelyn soon replaced Daniel and Nadia by taking their
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Show your elemental construct," Sigfor said as he folded his arms and
          looked at them keenly. His eyes narrowed slightly, curiosity piqued.
        </p>
        <p>He was curious what they had come up with…</p>
        <p>And how could he not be?</p>
        <p>Both of them were exceptional talents.</p>
        <p>
          However, their elements were not really compatible according to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Light and water elements were not exactly the most destructive
          elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least not until the individual progressed to higher levels and had
          more mastery over their elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          At their level, being Rank-1 exorcists, they did not have that level
          of control and mastery yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          So he did not have much hope for them to come up with something
          powerful and destructive like the previous two duos.
        </p>
        <p>
          In most cases, they could either come up with something related to
          healing or defense.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was understandable. Both water and light elements, if used properly
          and effectively, could create some of the most powerful healing
          techniques known to mankind or some extremely sturdy and creative
          barriers.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to see what these two exceptional kids had come up with. His
          fingers tapped lightly against his arm, a subtle sign of his
          anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am ready." Evelyn motioned towards Oliver as she signaled for him
          to start.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded and stretched out his hand in front of him, his palm
          facing the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Espera started to channel through his fingers as puddles of water
          began to form in front of him, near his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not stop and kept his hand in the same position as more and
          more puddles of water started to appear on the ground in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          A moment later, the ground was filled with multiple puddles of water.
          Using moisture as a medium in the damp environment where they were, he
          was easily able to form so many puddles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The glistening puddles reflected the faint light, creating a
          shimmering effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it a coincidence that they were in a damp environment to begin
          with, or was this the effect of his level-4 luck?
        </p>
        <p>
          There was always some level of moisture or water vapor present in the
          air at all times. It was not difficult for him to gather them and use
          espera to give them proper shape or expand them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just when everyone was watching curiously, wondering what the water
          puddles were for, Oliver did something again.
        </p>
        <p>
          His palm, facing towards the puddles, clenched into a fist as the
          water beneath shook violently.
        </p>
        <p>
          The water puddles shook and started to float above the ground, rising
          in the air in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the water puddles were at his eye level, in wobbly shapes and
          sizes. His eyes turned sharp as he kept his fist towards them.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          He suddenly opened the clenched fist and tremendous espera began to
          ooze out of it. The espera flowed as if a dam had broken loose; it was
          almost leaking!
        </p>
        <p>
          The air buzzed with energy, making the hair on their arms stand up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every single person present in that area felt the tremendous amount of
          espera coming out of his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's expression hardened as his eyes shook slightly. He could feel
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The overflowing espera coming out of the body of the kid barely
          Rank-1…
        </p>
        <p>
          The espera was dense and powerful, overpowering everything around. The
          most striking thing was the overwhelming amount of it radiating out of
          his body.
        </p>

        <p>
          Was this supposed to be the amount of espera a Rank-1 exorcist should
          have?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor questioned himself but he knew the answer better than anyone
          else present.
        </p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>
          The espera was way stronger and more potent than any Rank-1 could
          muster. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          The sheer quantity radiating out of Oliver's body was way, way higher
          than any Rank-1 he had ever met or seen in his decades of experience.
        </p>
        <p>'Twice? Thrice?'</p>
        <p>
          He calculated the number of times his espera amount was when compared
          to an ordinary Rank-1.
        </p>
        <p>'No… it's close to seven times!'</p>
        <p>The moment he realized this, Sigfor's body stiffened up.</p>
        <p>He could not comprehend what was taking place in front of him.</p>
        <p>
          How could a kid with barely above-average espera suddenly radiate
          seven times the amount of espera?
        </p>
        <p>His mind raced, considering and discarding explanations.</p>
        <p>Was this the play of an artifact?</p>
        <p>
          It was possible if the kid was using an artifact that held the
          capability to store and release espera at will.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he could not see any such artifacts on him. His senses were sharp;
          he was confident he would have been able to locate an artifact easily
          unless he hid it really well and deep with another stealth artifact,
          which he clearly did not do.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it was his natural espera. The realization sent a chill down
          Sigfor's spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's fingers trembled as he felt the incomparably dense espera. He
          had to admit that Oliver was definitely an anomaly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took a deep breath as he kept his mind focused on what they were
          going to show. His heart could not help but beat faster in excitement.
          The thrill of witnessing such potential was undeniable.
        </p>
        <p>
          He patiently watched them perform. He looked at the barrier he had
          erected using a special barrier talisman. There were some visible
          changes happening to the barrier too, not visible to the naked,
          inexperienced eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the top edge of the barrier, he could see it ripple continuously,
          clearly being affected by the tremendous espera gathering and
          interfering with it from inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head. The barrier talisman that he had used was at best
          suited for Rank-2 exorcists, yet seeing it ripple in such a way made
          his heart have complex emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not expect that someone among them would be able to interfere
          with his barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          He pointed his finger at the ripples and in the next moment, they
          paused as the barrier seemed to have become strengthened compared to
          before since Oliver's espera was no longer interfering with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's brows aligned as he keenly gazed at the wobbly water puddles
          in front of him slowly changing their shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The espera focused on the water started to act and reshape the
          puddles, turning them into spherical forms, flattening their surfaces.
          The water glistened, reflecting the light in mesmerizing patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          The whole air was filled with multiple spherical water balls and
          mirror-like surfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The water was polished and still as the espera kept them stabilized in
          the air.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 152 &nbsp;Gamma Rays! Cage of Radiation</h2>
        <p>Chapter 152</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn, who was watching this, could not help but take a deep breath.
          The sight was breathtaking, each sphere a testament to Oliver's
          control. The shimmering spheres hovered like celestial bodies,
          radiating a serene yet powerful aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment Oliver released his espera, her breath hitched, and her
          heart almost leaped into her throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had never seen any of her peers with such a sheer quantity of
          espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, she had never felt this pressured before. The gap between them was
          so wide, she was starting to realize it now.
        </p>
        <p>She could finally see it.</p>
        <p>The gap between her and him, it was vast, extremely vast.</p>
        <p>
          She looked down at her hand; it was trembling slightly from being
          exposed to the overwhelming espera coming from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          'If he had this much espera since the beginning, then it made sense
          how he reached so high up during the mountain climb…'
        </p>
        <p>
          She inhaled deeply to calm her nerves. Fortunately, she had already
          practiced with him multiple times beforehand, or else she might not
          have been able to keep her composure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first time they tried it, she almost fell upon coming in contact
          with that sheer amount of espera.
        </p>
        <p>"Huff…"</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's eyes narrowed as she clasped her hands together. Closing her
          eyes, she focused as she channeled the light within her to move
          forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next moment, a bright ray of light emerged from her body. It
          was blinding, making any onlooker close their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, she concentrated, and soon the blinding white light dimmed
          slowly, turning into a single focused ray—a dense, potent white ray of
          light focused in front of her.
        </p>
        <p>"Go!"</p>
        <p>
          She opened her eyes and, with a powerful burst of espera, launched the
          ray of light towards Oliver—more specifically, towards the cage of
          water spheres and constructs.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not relax and immediately conjured another blinding light,
          compressing it to a dense white ray, and threw it towards the water
          cage.
        </p>

        <p>
          She repeated this, one ray of light after another, each filled with
          energy and momentum.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her face was set in determined concentration, her movements precise
          and unwavering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver used [Cosmic Void Gaze] as he saw the incoming lights; all of
          them were slowed down in his vision as they moved and entered the cage
          of water spheres.
        </p>
        <p>He stretched forward his hand and snapped his fingers.</p>
        <p>
          In an instant, the water bodies moved, accommodating the rays of
          light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something happened: the light that should have passed through the
          water puddles was instead reflected backward!
        </p>
        <p>Not refracted?</p>
        <p>
          Reflection is the process where light bounces back from a surface
          rather than passing through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This phenomenon occurs prominently when the water surface is calm and
          undisturbed. Under these conditions, the water can act like a mirror,
          reflecting light rays in a manner similar to a flat, smooth surface.
        </p>
        <p>However, that was not only it.</p>
        <p>
          Reflection is noticeable primarily when an appropriate angle is made
          when the light strikes the water, a low angle close to horizontal.
        </p>
        <p>Like when it happens during sunrise or sunset.</p>
        <p>
          Instead of refracting out of the water, the light is entirely
          reflected back into the water.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the more common phenomenon was 'refraction'; usually, it was
          expected for light to pass directly through the water into the air.
          And the angle requirement is pretty suitable for it to happen as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both reflection and refraction happen naturally in water, but
          refraction is way more common in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver adjusted the water constructs at such a position and angle that
          all the light rays reflected perfectly from one surface to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon, the multiple light beams entered the sort-of water cage that
          Oliver had perfectly and precisely angled and moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          What happened was the light beams, instead of dying down and
          disappearing, did not dull but instead kept getting reflected faster
          and faster in that cage of water constructs.
        </p>
        <p>Now, here's the theory that Oliver had proposed.</p>

        <p>
          The laws and physics of this world were not similar to those of his
          previous world so far as he had noticed already. While a lot of
          concepts were similar, due to the presence of an energy called
          'espera,' many things were different or did not exist at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          It meant that the water in these constructs was not ordinary water but
          instead a form of "shiny water" that possessed unique energy-storing
          properties.
        </p>
        <p>
          The constructs of water were made using his tremendous espera, and not
          to mention, he was continuously supplying espera into them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          These shiny water constructs could absorb and store large amounts of
          energy from the environment or an external source.
        </p>
        <p>The external source being him and the light beams.</p>
        <p>
          When light beams (photons) were directed into the cage of shiny water
          constructs, the interaction between the light and the water surfaces
          was designed to allow for perfect reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perfect reflection means that the photons do not lose energy during
          reflection but can instead gain energy from the water constructs.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was using his espera to make the shiny water constructs have the
          ability to transfer energy to the photons through a process akin to
          stimulated emission, where the photons gain additional energy from the
          water molecules.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each reflection within the cage increased the energy of the photons
          incrementally, turning them into high-energy photons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shiny water spheres acted as micro-lenses, ensuring minimal energy
          loss and maximum energy transfer.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the flat water surfaces acted as perfect mirrors, reflecting the
          light beams without scattering, maintaining the coherence and
          directionality of the light.
        </p>
        <p>Screech!</p>
        <p>
          As the light beams reflected multiple times within the cage, they
          continuously gained energy, eventually reaching destructive levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sharp, high-pitched screeching sound was heard from time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air seemed to vibrate with the intensity of the charged photons.
        </p>
        <p>
          These high-energy light beams were nothing simple; they were potent
          ionizing rays with extreme destructive potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ionizing radiation includes particles or electromagnetic waves with
          enough energy to ionize atoms or molecules by detaching electrons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, they have enough energy to remove the tightly bound
          electrons from atoms, capable of splitting atoms into ions!
        </p>
        <p>
          It includes alpha particles, beta particles, neutrons, and high-energy
          photons (X-rays and gamma rays).
        </p>

        <p>
          It was an instant death if someone dared to step into a zone of
          high-dose ionized radiation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cage, at the moment, was something similar. It was a cage
          containing high levels of these gamma rays.
        </p>
        <p>It was a cage of death!</p>
        <p>
          One step into it, and getting cancer was the least of worries; it was
          almost impossible to escape death without special protection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gamma rays at extreme doses cause irreversible damage to the central
          nervous system; they directly lead to CNS failure—directly attacking
          the brain and nerves and killing the entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a typical nuclear accident or disaster, the estimated dose was
          around 10-30 Sv (a unit to measure the level), which was as good as a
          guaranteed death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Typically, that should have been the case. However, Oliver and Evelyn
          were not at that level yet, nor did they intend to reach that level
          themselves for this demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was very natural for them to surpass this threshold and reach
          extremely destructive levels if they continued to grow their espera in
          the future and become higher-ranking exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for now, this small practical demonstration had basically put up a
          foundation for a much deadlier weapon of mass destruction for the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, Oliver's entire focus was drawn to the water cage. His
          entire concentration was on maintaining the balance and adjusting the
          positions of the water constructs repeatedly and continuously to
          accommodate the light rays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The radiation level forming inside the water cage was not too high
          either. But it was still dangerous for a human body.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes shone as he once again adjusted the water constructs. He was
          continuously using [Cosmic Void Gaze] on top of supplying espera to
          the cage of water. It was draining his mental energy as well as espera
          too much.
        </p>
        <p>He could already feel a sense of fatigue in his body.</p>
        <p>
          Of course, it was as simple as minor fatigue. He still had Abyss
          energy inside him to support and sustain him. Even if his espera was
          depleted down to zero, he would not die. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, it was too draining and gave an uncomfortable feeling to
          him. He wanted it to be over as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>However, Oliver's gaze shifted as he said, "Evelyn, it's ready."</p>
        <p>
          To which, Evelyn moved quickly. She went up to the metallic training
          dummy in the corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a deep breath, she tightened her grip around the gnarled roots of
          the dummy, feeling the rough texture bite into her palms.
        </p>
        <p>
          She heaved, the muscles in her arms straining as she pulled with all
          her might. There was a moment of resistance.
        </p>
        <p>Her heart pounded in her chest, each beat echoing in her ears.</p>
        <p>Snap!</p>
        <p>
          Then, with a loud snapping sound, the roots of the dummy gave way, a
          cascade of soil crumbling around its legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          She stumbled back, the now-liberated metallic dummy clutched in her
          hands, its legs that were rooted into the earth beneath dangling and
          dripping with dirt.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at the dummy in her hands before gazing back at Oliver, who
          nodded at her.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 153 &nbsp;Getting out of control? Sigfor steps in!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 153</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn looked at the dummy in her hands before gazing back at Oliver,
          who nodded at her. Her fingers tightened around the dummy, feeling the
          weight of what they were about to demonstrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pulled her hand back and, with force, threw the dummy into the
          air, aiming towards the floating water cage in front of Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dummy flew in an arc straight towards the intended location,
          landing directly into the cage of water constructs. The surroundings
          fell silent, all eyes following the dummy's trajectory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment the dummy landed inside the cage, a reaction occurred,
          visible to everyone present.
        </p>
        <p>Swish! Swish!</p>
        <p>
          With a swift gesture, the beams of light that were continuously
          reflecting inside the cage collided with the surface of the metal,
          immediately distorting its plain surface, slowly breaking it—melting
          it down as the ionized radiations passed through it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The metal hissed and bubbled, its form warping under the intense
          energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every single person watching this could not help but hold their
          breath. It was too terrifying—beautifully so.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sight of a cage of water reflecting lights and melting literal
          metal—for some reason, the scene looked unreal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Light and water, the two most sensitive and docile elements known…
        </p>
        <p>
          The two elements known for being used mainly in defense and healing…
        </p>
        <p>Yet, what were they seeing right now?</p>
        <p>
          The same two humble elements were showcasing a destructive might that
          was far greater than any other elements. The water shimmered,
          refracting the light into lethal beams, while the light itself seemed
          to pulse with raw power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, all of them felt that their combinations so far were as good
          as mud in front of this.
        </p>
        <p>Was this how it was supposed to be?</p>
        <p>
          Should they not have shown something related to healing or barrier
          arts?
        </p>
        <p>What was this even?</p>

        <p>
          How was light even able to pierce through metal? And damage it too?
        </p>
        <p>And what was the water even doing other than bouncing off lights?</p>
        <p>
          There were many questions that their childish brains could not
          understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, one person was able to grasp everything and see it
          thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p>'Maddening! Absolutely maddening!'</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's mental state was in turmoil. Everything he had seen so far
          had lost any sense to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was staring at the demonstration by the two kids with eyes as wide
          as saucers; he could not take his eyes off this genius spectacle at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>His hands trembled slightly, barely containing his astonishment.</p>
        <p>
          His body was shaking; he was in self-disbelief at what he was
          witnessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two mere kids yet to cross the age of ten had managed to pull off
          something even veteran exorcists would never be able to achieve.
        </p>
        <p>He really meant what he thought.</p>
        <p>
          To be able to figure out the properties of light and water at their
          age and then implement them practically was nothing but genius!
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not understand how they were able to deduce these things to
          such an extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be able to skim through things that researchers dedicated their
          lifetimes to in a matter of days, how smart were they both!?
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaving the matter of theory aside for a second, to be able to
          implement it practically was what truly set them apart from others.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had met a few light exorcists in his life, but even after having a
          thorough understanding of their element, implementing such a thing was
          impossible for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only would one need to be able to adjust the reflecting surfaces,
          but at the same time, they would be required to have a keen control
          over their espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          A vast amount of espera needed to be continuously supplied to the
          reflecting objects or surfaces, and at the same time, someone skilled
          enough to keep track of all light rays in that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding such a person who could do that was extremely difficult, one
          with such a level of coordination with the light element.
        </p>

        <p>
          How was Oliver able to keep up with these light beams? n/ô/vel/b//jn
          dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor narrowed his eyes, espera radiating from his vision; he was
          still not able to keep track of all those multiple light rays no
          matter how much he focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          How could he? They were moving at the speed of light. He would be
          inhuman if he could keep track of them all.
        </p>
        <p>But then how was Oliver able to do that?</p>
        <p>
          He reasoned that if he was not wrong, then perhaps, Oliver was also
          not able to see these light rays at all but instead was depending on
          his instincts to adjust the water constructs to accommodate light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, but then how was he so accurate? Not a single light beam escaped
          the water matrix.
        </p>
        <p>
          For that, Sigfor believed it was thanks to his high level of synergy
          with Evelyn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unknowingly, both of them had managed to achieve a ridiculously high
          synergy with each other, making him able to connect with her and feel
          the flow of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, there was no logical reason that could explain how he was
          able to perfectly manipulate the water constructs.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no way his eyes could keep up with the speed of light,
          right?
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor shook his head. There was definitely no way that was possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had heard of cases where two people would achieve a crazy synergy
          with one another, but the majority of them were from people who held
          strong emotions for the other person—basically couples in love.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, it's not like that is definite. Both of them are geniuses among
          geniuses, so they might have been able to reach that state,' he
          thought.
        </p>
        <p>"Umm…"</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a small voice drew his attention.</p>
        <p>
          He looked at Oliver, who was making a complex face. Just as he was
          wondering what was wrong, he heard him say.
        </p>
        <p>"Elder, I am not able to dismiss it…"</p>
        <p>Sigfor's eyes trembled when he heard this.</p>
        <p>
          If Oliver stopped now, the water constructs would instantly turn back
          into liquid form, and the light inside, which was currently a
          high-energy beam, would explode out.
        </p>

        <p>The realization hit him like a cold splash of water.</p>
        <p>
          He did not worry about the other children thanks to the barrier he had
          faith in.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he was not so sure about the two kids inside. They might not be
          unharmed if that happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you doing!? Did you guys not practice this before coming
          here!?" Sigfor asked in a loud voice, a hint of agitation in his tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, the thing is… we did not do it to this degree. Whenever the
          light would get a little powerful, we would cancel it immediately…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn said in a small voice. She was also looking at the cage with
          distress. She was far away; the one who would get hurt the most would
          be Oliver if it exploded.
        </p>
        <p>"You what!?"</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor was so angry at this moment that he wanted to beat these two.
          The previous admiration for their talents and intellect was quickly
          consumed by the rage he felt for their careless behavior.
        </p>
        <p>His hands clenched at his sides, knuckles turning white.</p>
        <p>It was simply life-threatening for them!</p>
        <p>
          To act without knowing about the proper consequences and not care
          about anything, not only were they risking their lives but also the
          lives of their comrades.
        </p>
        <p>He could not help but grit his teeth in irritation.</p>
        <p>
          This was a really risky situation. Both of them might not realize
          this, but he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Step aside!" he yelled at Evelyn, making her flinch. She looked at
          him with conflict; she did not want to leave Oliver behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should she try and control those light rays inside? It seemed to be
          quite difficult, but she would not allow someone close to her to get
          harmed because of her abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          She trembled as she started to put her hand forward towards the light.
          When it seemed that she was about to try it despite the warnings, a
          loud voice interrupted her unstable thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "JUST DO IT!" Sigfor could not take her indecisiveness any longer and
          roared furiously. She was just wasting time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boy might have tremendous espera, but it was not infinite. He
          would run out of it sooner or later, and from the looks of it, he
          seemed close to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment he lost control, the explosion would happen. Before
          something unthinkable happened to either of them, he had to intervene.
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice was so loud thanks to espera that all of them had a ringing
          sensation in their ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes…" she said weakly before glancing in Oliver's direction one last
          time and making her way towards the edge of the barrier, quietly
          exiting it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor waved his hand and sealed off the barrier, allowing no one to
          enter anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          He solemnly looked at the water cage with deep eyes. He could forcibly
          try to push it down, but he might hurt the kid in the process.
        </p>
        <p>He had no choice but to enter the barrier himself.</p>
        <p>A sense of urgency pushed him forward.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 154 &nbsp;Sigfor's might! Oliver's stunt!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 154</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor wasted no time, and made a quick hand gesture, bringing his
          index and middle fingers together, positioning them together in the
          front of his chest as he applied espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          A slit opening instantly appeared in the barrier, allowing him to
          enter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without delay, he moved through the opening in the barrier before
          sealing it behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, he was very close to the boy and his water construct cage. The
          heat from the ionized rays brushed against his skin, a dangerous
          reminder of the impending threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that he was this close to the cage of water, Sigfor truly felt the
          danger that was emanating from the box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even someone of his caliber, who was way above them, could sense its
          potential destructiveness. He wouldn't dare imagine just what sort of
          havoc it could wreak once they had reached higher levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor exhaled slowly, his eyes turning sharp with focus. He readied
          himself, channeling all his energy into the task at hand. The weight
          of responsibility settled on his shoulders, driving his resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The moment I say back off, run towards the edge of the barrier
          without even looking back. Don't bother with anything, just leave," he
          instructed Oliver in a solemn, unwavering voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was absolutely serious, there was no room for any slips. His tone
          left no room for doubt, the gravity of the situation was clear.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver looked at the elder who had entered and nodded.</p>
        <p>His seemingly unworried demeanor infuriated the elder even more.</p>

        <p>'This kid has no idea how dangerous this stunt is!'</p>
        <p>
          That was what the elder thought, but how could he know what Oliver was
          thinking?
        </p>
        <p>
          To be clear, Oliver really didn't fear the explosion. If it happened,
          he could easily suppress the outcome with Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, he was confident that he could very well protect
          himself and his body using the Abyss energy too.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it was just that he couldn't use it in front of others, lest
          they labeled him a heretic or some demonic being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he had tested it beforehand and was confident that the
          elder should be able to suppress it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing Oliver nod, Sigfor focused and closed his hand towards the
          water cage, gathering a massive amount of espera, hundreds of times
          higher than Oliver's, in front of his fist.
        </p>
        <p>After a moment of tense silence, the elder shouted.</p>
        <p>"Leave!" n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om</p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't hesitate; using the water elemental espera, he threw the
          cage towards the elder and ran back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing this, Sigfor's pupils contracted. He had only told the boy to
          leave without doing anything, yet this little bastard had actually
          thrown the entire cage towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did he want to kill him? And that was even when he was there to save
          this brat!
        </p>
        <p>Too outrageous!</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor knew that he didn't have the time to get angry as the massive
          water cage hurled in his direction, the water constructs
          disintegrating from its former shape, turning into nothing more than
          simple liquids.
        </p>

        <p>The high-energy lights shot towards him all at once.</p>
        <p>
          Even with all this happening, Sigfor remained composed and pointed his
          claw at the light beam. The massive espera quickly collided with the
          beam, engulfing it entirely.
        </p>
        <p>BOOM!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver barely made it out of the barrier in the nick of time before a
          massive explosion erupted behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shockwave from the blast propelled him forward, but he landed
          smoothly before trying to catch his breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had thrown the water cage towards Sigfor so that he could get more
          time to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          'It seems that the elder handled it well,' he thought, observing the
          barrier with calm eyes that shone with a certain light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the whole barrier's interior was shrouded in clouds of smoke,
          Oliver could see things clearly thanks to [Cosmic Void Gaze], through
          which he spotted a distant figure standing amidst the smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          He blinked and stopped using his special eyes; he was already mentally
          drained and any more effort might cause him to faint. He could already
          feel the last vestiges of his strength slipping away.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the children present held their breaths as they watched the
          barrier crack slowly before crumbling like broken glass and vanishing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smoke had begun to clear out thanks to the wind and Alphonso sped
          up the wind waves, quickly dissipating it. A collective sigh of relief
          was felt as the air cleared.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all saw Elder Sigfor's figure. His clothes were charred black,
          burnt from the sides, and his sleeves were ripped. He looked like a
          beggar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Miraculously, his body did not seem to have even an inch of a wound.
          It was tough and unscathed.
        </p>

        <p>His stern expression, however, spoke volumes.</p>
        <p>"This…"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel was at a loss for words. He had just witnessed something
          extremely incredible. He glanced towards Evelyn and Oliver with
          literal stars in his eyes, his admiration for the duo growing
          boundlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          His body itched to recreate something similar to the previous stunt
          with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the thought of thunder in that cage of death made him shiver in
          excitement, almost causing him to hallucinate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the sight of the annoying old man, who would always act
          arrogantly towards them turning into a beggar added another sense of
          satisfaction to Daniel's mind. He couldn't help but silently cheer the
          duo for making Sigfor taste dust.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That was hella awesome, you guys! I CAN'T WAIT TO DO IT WITH YOU
          TWO!!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel almost screamed, praising them and completely ignoring Sigfor,
          who was glaring at him with a dead gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          The others tactically chose to remain silent, noticing Sigfor's stare
          at the chattering Daniel.
        </p>
        <p>'Damn, he's so obliviously bold!'</p>
        <p>
          All the others shared the same thought as they watched him chattering
          non-stop, praising the duo for that combination from before and
          expressing his desire to do something similar with them.
        </p>
        <p>'He's done for.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver silently sent his best wishes to Daniel, who was cluelessly
          laughing with Sigfor right behind him.
        </p>
        <p>"Great, let me teach you how to do that."</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's deep voice rang in Daniel's ears as a hand clasped his left
          shoulder, making him freeze.
        </p>
        <p>A chill ran down Daniel's spine and his smile soon faltered.</p>
        <p>
          For some reason, Daniel's instincts screamed at him about the disaster
          that was about to befall him.
        </p>
        <p>Alas, it was already too late.</p>
        <p>
          In the end, the silent hall reverberated with the painful shrieks of a
          boy.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 155 &nbsp;Unexpected winners?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 155</p>
        <p>
          After that incident, both Oliver and Evelyn were severely reprimanded
          by the old Sigfor, who made sure that they had it engraved into their
          brains that safety and tests were important before pulling any such
          stunts.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stern lecture echoed in their minds, leaving a lasting impression.
        </p>
        <p>
          And after getting some punishments, they moved on to the challenge
          winner being announced.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, the winner is…" A tense hush fell over the group, anticipation
          hanging in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, all of you did some pretty great combinations, some even took it
          a 'step further' and did something even more 'amazing' too."
        </p>
        <p>
          He jabbed and looked at the trio, Oliver, Evelyn, and lastly Daniel,
          who for some reason had a swollen face. The silent accusation in his
          gaze was unmistakable.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now, I am going to declare the winners. It's based solely on my
          judgment about various aspects of your elemental combinations and
          other stuff such as your level of synergy."
        </p>
        <p>He said in a calm voice as he looked at the group.</p>
        <p>"The winners are Amber and Alphonso."</p>

        <p>
          His words came off as an unexpected announcement as everyone looked at
          him with surprise visible in their eyes, clearly not expecting the
          outcome—even the winners were confused and incredulous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber looked at Alphonso, then back at Sigfor. She clearly did not
          expect them to win in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          But soon, the confusion was replaced by a smug expression as she
          flared up her chest high, clearly looking happy. Her triumphant grin
          spoke volumes of her satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          She glanced around only to see everyone looking confused except for
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after all this, his expression was one of utter uninterested, he
          did not seem to be bothered by the outcome at all, a bored expression
          in his eyes as he watched the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          His indifference was in clear contrast to the excitement around him
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso could not bear the silence any longer and questioned, "This…
          Elder Sigfor, are you really sure about this…?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice sounded hesitant. What he was doing was basically declaring
          that he did not think his team was worthy of winning the challenge and
          that Sigfor probably had made a mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Alphonso had a streak in him to win and become strong, his pride
          as a gentleman did not allow him to win by cheating or
          misunderstandings.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is as you have heard. You both are the winners of this challenge
          and will receive the deserving rewards for it. There's no scope for
          mistake; I have thoroughly judged it." He paused, his eyes wandering
          off to a certain duo before he added further.
        </p>
        <p>
          "And I clearly did not just judge it based on your 'destructive' power
          at all."
        </p>
        <p>His words had a hint of sarcasm to them as he said that sentence.</p>

        <p>
          Alphonso had a realization dawn on him. He felt that he was now able
          to understand what the elder meant and why they were declared the
          winners instead. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quite evident that Sigfor was really angry with Evelyn and
          Oliver this time. They both carelessly acted and neglected the safety
          of those around them; it was basically a death sentence had they been
          on a battlefield, which they surely would be in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's way to declare them the winners was a method to teach both
          Oliver and Evelyn, the duo who were better than Amber and Alphonso in
          everything, be it their synergy to the overall destructive power of
          their elemental combination, that ensuring the safety of their
          comrades and themselves was more important than anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          To have your comrades die due to your mistake was one of the worst
          things ever on a battlefield with demons.
        </p>
        <p>He was conveying this to them.</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso's heart felt conflicted at this thought. He knew that he and
          Amber did not deserve to be the victors at all; they were simply being
          used to set an example for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But on the other hand, he felt that Sigfor could have also used Daniel
          and Nadia's team as well to demonstrate this and set an example but
          instead chose theirs. Didn't that mean that he still sincerely
          evaluated them?
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered if he should really accept this honor and refuse to
          acknowledge this.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind churned with conflicting thoughts, each one weighing heavily
          on him.
        </p>
        <p>Just as he was in conflict, Amber's voice rang out close to him.</p>
        <p>
          "Don't be an overthinker. Elder Sigfor has insight that we won't be
          able to understand. If he has said that we are the winners, then there
          must be something behind that as well. I know what you are thinking,
          but you need to trust the elder. He's basically our mentor," she said
          in a flat tone, clearly not impressed that Alphonso was being such a
          wimp about such a small matter.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alphonso became silent as he heard her words. He considered her
          advice, and it did make sense. He was probably being too concerned
          over such a trivial matter.
        </p>
        <p>Her pragmatism cut through his doubts, grounding him.</p>
        <p>
          At least they would be getting a reward now for being victorious in
          the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are right, haha. I am thinking too much," he apologized and
          looked back at the elder.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You two, come and collect it afterwards in the evening. All of you
          are dismissed now."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor waved his hand and left the children after telling them to
          dismiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hah! That old bastard! I bet you both will get double training as a
          reward from him," Daniel scoffed the moment Sigfor left, his voice
          seeming muffled due to the beatings that made his cheeks swollen.
        </p>
        <p>His swollen face twisted into a grimace as he spoke.</p>
        <p>He hated the old man even more so now.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia was calm. She was still looking at Oliver's back discreetly.
        </p>
        <p>Her eyes held no trace of emotion as she recalled Sigfor's words.</p>
        <p>'Pathetic.'</p>
        <p>
          She thought when she heard him preach about danger and safety like a
          saint.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew all too well how many of his comrades he must have killed or
          sacrificed to have survived so far from the battlefields.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had no right to tell them about it. She felt it was very pathetic
          and cowardly of that old man to even utter a word about safety
          standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her disdain for him grew, solidifying her resolve to use that weapon
          that Oliver had displayed in some way or another.
        </p>
        <p>She could not care less about a withering old man.&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Chapter 156 &nbsp;Heretics arrive!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 156</p>
        <p>
          In her eyes, the spectacle that Oliver had just shown her was nothing
          more than a powerful weapon they could use in the future to slaughter
          demons. A dangerous tool in the ongoing war against their enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          If only they somehow managed to overcome the lack of espera with a
          huge amount of espera and some minor changes, they could conduct this
          same combination on a massive scale, a way bigger experiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the level of destruction they could bring to their enemy's
          homeland was unthinkable. It was definitely a weapon worth polishing.
          The potential was immense, and the thought of it brought a cold aura
          around her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had to try something of a similar level with her ice element as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>Her eyes turned deadly cold at that moment…</p>
        <p>
          In the end, everyone left with complicated emotions. Undoubtedly, they
          all knew who the actual winners and deserving ones were, but no one
          said it out loud.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unspoken truth hung heavy in the air, a silent acknowledgment of
          their real abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, Amber and Alphonso went to collect their rewards, which were
          some rune booklets and a tool for exorcism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their expressions were a mix of pride and uncertainty, still
          processing the day's events.
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>

        <p>
          Outside, some distance away from the base of the mountain, a group of
          cloaked individuals was standing.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of them were dressed in dark robes, their faces hidden in shrouds
          as they faced the base of the mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I did not expect the exorcist from the Mystic Purge Clan to leave the
          clan so soon."
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the cloaked individuals said in a heavy tone, his body bulging
          with muscles, making him appear much larger than the others.
        </p>
        <p>His presence was imposing, a silent threat to anyone nearby.</p>
        <p>
          "This definitely means that the exorcist is not aware of the thing
          they are carrying with them. They are most likely unaware of the egg
          of the disaster beast."
        </p>
        <p>
          Another figure said. From her feminine tone and high-pitched voice, it
          was evident she was a woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her voice carried a note of excitement, barely concealed under her
          cloak.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shh, don't utter that word. It is impossible to know when someone
          might hear our talk," a man of short stature said in a wary tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come on, you are worrying too much. We are in the middle of nowhere.
          No one's going to hear us. Toughen up!" the woman said in a sly voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man could not refute her words since what she said was true. The
          mountain in the distance was the only thing here. It was weird that
          such a huge mountain was located in the middle of nowhere.
        </p>
        <p>The desolate landscape added to their sense of security.</p>

        <p>It might have been an old ruin.</p>
        <p>
          "The signals are coming strongly from the base of the mountain… the
          target is there."
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a fourth person spoke. His dark black robe was designed with
          a certain pattern, different from his companions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was exuding a powerful and sinister aura, much denser than the
          others. He was clearly their superior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, all of them quieted down and listened to his words
          seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We are close. The exorcist is oblivious to the precious treasure.
          However, I can sense a strong presence at the base of the mountain.
          It's dangerous."
        </p>
        <p>
          He spoke in a static voice, making the others frown. After all, no
          matter how much they tried, they were not able to sense any strong
          presences from the mountain base.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since their leader could feel it, this could only mean that the
          individual present there was stronger than them.
        </p>
        <p>If so, they could not act and attack carelessly.</p>
        <p>A misstep could cost them everything.</p>
        <p>They needed to know the situation a bit more.</p>
        <p>"What are your orders, leader?" the woman asked in a polite tone.</p>

        <p>
          The leader in question remained silent for a moment, thinking through
          this and deciding on a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Scatter around and map out the terrain. Find the break points. The
          mountain is covered in a special barrier. It's not an easy one. Locate
          the weak spot. We will infiltrate the mountain first. Hide your
          presences using the tools given to you. Don't dare to let yourself be
          revealed even slightly if you don't want to die," he finally said.
        </p>
        <p>His voice carried a finality that brooked no argument.</p>
        <p>
          It was simple: if they got exposed, the powerful exorcist inside would
          directly kill them. The leader would not step in to save them if that
          happened. They would be on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          This showed just how strong the person inside was for their leader to
          be cautious of them as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leader they were with was a special individual selected by the
          supreme master of the cult just for this task.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all had heard about his extraordinary strength and killing
          techniques. He was ruthless and had slaughtered countless exorcists so
          far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, with him present, they would have directly barged inside,
          killed the exorcists present inside, and retrieved the egg.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for a presence inside to make their leader wary of them meant it
          was not going to be a simple mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, all of them were specially selected for this mission to
          retrieve the egg of the disaster beast. They all had abilities to back
          themselves.
        </p>
        <p>It was not for nothing that they were here in the first place.</p>
        <p>
          The exorcist who had the egg belonged to the Mystic Purge Clan. It
          would be stupid for them to assume he would be weak.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why they were here: to hunt him down and get the treasure
          back!
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, that would mean making enemies with one of the five major
          clans. However, since the orders were from their masters, they would
          not hesitate in doing what was told.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heretics like them often avoided exorcists from the major clans not
          only because they were quite strong and annoying to deal with but also
          because if one of their exorcists were targeted, the whole clan would
          hunt them down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Escaping the Mystic Purge Clan's reach in human territory was close to
          impossible. This was how influential a major clan was.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Leader, can I slaughter the exorcists inside if I am careful enough?"
          the burly man asked for permission in his heavy masculine tone. His
          eyes gleamed with bloodlust.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leader's expression was indifferent. He had pale skin and black
          irises. He gazed at the burly man for a moment before shifting his
          focus back to the mountain.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 157 &nbsp;Weapon selection!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 157</p>
        <p>
          The leader's expression was indifferent. He had pale skin and black
          irises. He gazed at the burly man for a moment before shifting his
          focus back to the mountain.
        </p>
        <p>"Do whatever you like."</p>
        <p>
          The burly man with brown skin smiled wickedly at that, his hands
          itching for blood and flesh. He was going to kill everyone inside and
          drink their blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Leader, what about you?" the man with short stature questioned with
          respect.
        </p>
        <p>"I will do nothing."</p>
        <p>"…." n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om</p>
        <p>The group looked at him with blank expressions.</p>
        <p>"This… Leader, are you sure?" the woman hesitated and wondered.</p>
        <p>
          "I will be making preparations for a killer array in advance. Once we
          manage to pass through the barrier, I will engage with the expert
          present inside while you retrieve the egg."
        </p>
        <p>He spoke in a dark tone, making others tremble.</p>
        <p>
          His words carried an unspoken threat, a promise of what was to come.
        </p>

        <p>Killer Array!</p>
        <p>
          It was one of the demons' inventions, designed to deal with the pesky,
          troublesome exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The array consisted of extremely destructive and violent runes. Just
          one array was enough to eliminate a plethora of exorcists with a
          single activation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, it was a death trap for any exorcist who would be caught
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          For their leader to activate such an expensive and complex array, they
          all knew that the situation was dire. The expert inside must have been
          a high-ranking exorcist since he was forced to use such an array.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah…"</p>
        <p>All of them had their eyes sparkling with lights of revelation.</p>
        <p>"That's great, leader!"</p>
        <p>"As expected of our leader!"</p>
        <p>
          They praised him like a group of bootlickers around a young master.
        </p>
        <p>
          The leader nodded, his eyes glistening with a sinister glow in them as
          he ordered them to disperse and create an opening in the barrier.
          Considering the barrier's sturdiness, it might take them weeks to do
          so, but it was worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          They would not get a chance better than this one. If the exorcist
          returned to the Mystic Purge Clan, then it would be impossible to
          reach them.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was their best opportunity, and they would never let this pass
          by!
        </p>
        <p>_____________</p>

        <p>It was soon the next day.</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor summoned the group of children, this time, all of them were
          seated on their desks while he was in front of them.
        </p>
        <p>"Now, you have two choices."</p>
        <p>
          He said as he summoned a thick old book and a spear. He then looked at
          them and continued, "Either we start with weapon training or runic
          studies. Discuss it and we will proceed with what you decide."
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as Sigfor finished, Daniel stood up from his desk and looked
          at others, "You guys have to choose weapon training!"
        </p>
        <p>
          His tone had excitement as if he was ready to defend his point to the
          very end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso looked at Evelyn, who was next to him and asked, "What do you
          think?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I am fine with either of the two. Both are going to be useful
          to us. I will follow what you guys decide," she replied with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Isn't runic knowledge more important…? Weapon training is going to be
          exhausting honestly," Amber said as she stretched her back.
        </p>
        <p>"That's true as well…" Alphonso muttered with a nod.</p>
        <p>
          "You guys can't be serious, right!? Amber, Alphonso, just think about
          how much fun it would be to train together! We can spar with that old
          ma—cough, elder Sigfor as much as we want! Don't you all want to know
          about his powers and we can also duel with each other! You guys,
          please…!" Daniel pleaded as he looked at the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You brat, you are still a hundred years early to dare to think about
          fighting me," Sigfor frowned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm…" Amber leaned forward on the desk, supporting her chin with her
          hand, she turned to look at Oliver and asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Oliver, what about you? What do you want to do?"</p>

        <p>
          "Me? I am fine with either. But since Daniel is requesting all of us,
          we should consider him too," he thought aloud.
        </p>
        <p>"Oliver, my dude! I love you!"</p>
        <p>
          "Stop being so cringe, Daniel," Amber scolded, making a disgusted face
          at his words.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well…" Alphonso smiled wryly before glancing at Nadia, who had an icy
          aura surrounding her. He didn't dare approach her, and given her
          stance, she probably did not care either way.
        </p>
        <p>
          He coughed twice and said, "Since it's like this, then Amber, I think
          we should take the weapon training first, we can always learn about
          runes later."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sure, if everyone is fine with it. I just mentioned it since I like
          runes more," Amber shrugged.
        </p>
        <p>"Haha…" Alphonso laughed and nodded at Daniel.</p>
        <p>
          "Elder Sigfor! We want you to teach us weapon training first!" he
          shouted, making sure that the elder had heard him clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing the brat yell, Sigfor frowned, it seemed like this brat hadn't
          learned his lesson even after getting beaten up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright then," he said, and the book vanished from his hand and
          returned back to his storage artifact. He then tapped the spear
          against the floor, producing a thud.
        </p>
        <p>"We will start with weapon training first!"</p>
        <p>"We will start with weapon training first!"</p>
        <p>
          Just as Sigfor announced, Daniel jumped in joy and made noises only to
          be silenced by the elder's anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "First, we shall see what weapons you kids feel the most comfortable
          with. If you already have a preference with the weapons you are
          comfortable with, then find it; otherwise, I will help you get one,"
          he said as he waved his hand and the next moment numerous training
          weapons appeared on the table before him.
        </p>
        <p>"I will use a sword!"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel leapt over and picked up a sleek sword, he then waved it in the
          air with swift and precise strikes.
        </p>
        <p>'Not bad.'</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor thought as he observed the kid's short movement and instantly
          recognized that Daniel was very familiar with his weapon—the sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          'As expected from the Sacred Swords Clan, they must have nurtured him
          with weapon techniques and training extensively.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 158 &nbsp;Oliver's choice</h2>
        <p>Chapter 158</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor knew how terrifying the Sacred Swords Clan's prowess was when
          it came to the handling of weapons—especially swords. They were second
          to none in swordsmanship.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were the best among all when it came to using and handling
          swords.
        </p>
        <p>
          It did not come as a surprise that their heir turned out to be a
          genius in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will have the spear," Alphonso said as he picked up a spear from
          the assortment of weapons. He was used to spears and with his wind
          element, it was quite a suitable choice for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elder, I am not sure about weapons…" Amber said as she looked at the
          array of weapons with interest, wondering just which weapon would best
          suit her. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes sparkled with curiosity as she imagined herself wielding each
          one.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm, which one of them attracts your eye the most?"</p>
        <p>
          "Well, if I had to say, then the hammer, greatsword, and gauntlets
          seem rather appealing," she muttered with fascination.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to use her own tools but knew that it wasn't allowed. She
          was much more comfortable using artifacts and her diverse exorcism
          tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then give each of them a try. We will go with the one that suits you
          the best," Sigfor said calmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Does this mean that I can choose multiple weapons?" she asked
          curiously.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Of course, there's no rule saying you can only select a single weapon
          for training," he replied.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Albeit, mastering a single weapon could be more fruitful for the
          future, but if you feel you can handle it, then be my guest and have a
          go with them," he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I understand, elder." Amber nodded and picked up the weapons. The
          weight of each one felt right in her hands, and she wondered which
          would become her favorite.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait, elder, then can I also have the bow as well?" Alphonso asked in
          a low voice, a little flustered. His eyes had been drawn to the bow
          alongside the spear as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since they could give it a try, he wanted to try using a bow once too.
          He might be more compatible with it in the long run after all.
        </p>
        <p>"Sure. Take it." Sigfor nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm! I think I will have this." Evelyn came forward and picked up a
          weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a sword—a katana, to be specific. She twisted her wrist and
          moved the katana in the air; it felt very familiar to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hand clutched the weapon tight as her eyes were drawn to the long
          blade. It could properly conduct her light element and channel her
          espera to it as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver followed behind her and picked up a katana as well. It was an
          exotic weapon, different from the traditional ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn saw this and made a surprised face. She asked, "You are also
          interested in a katana?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She was curious. Did Oliver also feel the same way as her about the
          weapon?
        </p>
        <p>"Something like that," he smiled and said.</p>
        <p>
          He could not tell her that since she was about to start practicing
          with the katana, he would automatically gain knowledge and experience
          about it as well sooner or later.
        </p>

        <p>
          She laughed and patted his shoulder. "Then it looks like we will spar
          a lot in the future."
        </p>
        <p>"Looks like that." He tilted his head and laughed a little.</p>
        <p>
          Amber, who was observing from the side, narrowed her eyes. She did not
          know when, but her grip on the hammer tightened a bit for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Last was Nadia. She looked at the array of weapons with disinterest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mother had already selected the perfect weapon for her back at the
          clan. After this was over, she was going to perform a ritual of
          selection with the weapon her mother had chosen once she returned to
          the clan.
        </p>
        <p>She did not need these weapons.</p>
        <p>
          But in the end, she still had to choose, so she picked up a longsword,
          a scythe, and some throwing weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It seems everyone has made their choice." Sigfor looked around and
          nodded. The weapons disappeared from the table back into his storage
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then, I will teach you how to improve your form. While my primary
          weapon might be different than yours, with my experience alone, I can
          help you all."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor said as he waved the spear in his hand. The air around the
          spear trembled before an illusionary dragonfly appeared at the tip of
          the spear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dragonfly flew over their heads before scattering into countless
          light particles and disappearing.
        </p>
        <p>They looked at it in awe.</p>
        <p>"Now then, get your weapons ready! All of you come at me!"</p>

        <p>
          Sigfor announced in a loud tone, suddenly making all the desks and
          chairs disappear.
        </p>
        <p>All that was left in the dilapidated hall was him and the kids.</p>
        <p>"FINE BY ME!"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel did not hesitate and swung his sword at Sigfor, his eyes fierce
          as if he wanted to actually slash him.
        </p>
        <p>"Humph."</p>
        <p>Sigfor easily parried his strike, pushing him back like nothing.</p>
        <p>Swing!</p>
        <p>
          Daniel did not back down and the next moment threw himself towards
          Sigfor again, only to be thrown backwards as their weapons collided.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          Daniel kept charging at Sigfor, his movements irregular and hurried.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver noticed this. While his moves looked irregular and reckless, he
          could feel a calculated and proper form behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He knows what he is doing.' Oliver thought as he observed the spar
          carefully. Daniel was constantly switching his form, wanting to take
          Sigfor by surprise but losing to him miserably after every turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that Daniel should focus more on one form first if he wanted
          to improve. Right now, it looked more like he wanted to defeat the
          elder at any cost and not actually learn and improve his form.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver was thinking when the elder's voice rang again.</p>
        <p>
          "What are you all waiting for? Did I not say to come at me at once?
          Come forward!" he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But sir, a spar should take place between the two parties only… It
          would be rude of us to cross the line and group together against you.
          It will be equal to cheating…" Alphonso said in a conflicted tone.
        </p>
        <p>Slap!</p>
        <p>The sound echoed in the hall, silencing everyone.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 159 &nbsp;Sparring with elder! Alphonso's decision!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 159</p>
        <p>Slap!</p>
        <p>Amber slapped his back, her face carrying a heavy frown.</p>
        <p>"Ouch! What was that for, Amber?" he asked as he winced in pain.</p>
        <p>
          "Are you kidding me!? Do you expect demons to follow your so-called
          morals and etiquette during a battle of life and death?" she snarled.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you think they will say, 'Oh, it's Mister Alphonso, the human
          noble! We can't fight him in groups! Let's fight him one by one!' Do
          you even have a brain!?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber voiced out, clearly pissed off at such a pathetic excuse on his
          end.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I-I never thought like that!" Alphonso flushed red while he denied
          her accusations.
        </p>
        <p>
          "T-That is different, h-here we are conducting a proper spar with the
          elder!" he tried to reason, but Amber only made a face that was too
          bored to listen to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do whatever you want. If you want to die so badly, then go and jump
          off the mountain cliff. I don't care."
        </p>
        <p>
          She said as she picked up gauntlets, wearing them. Her fingers
          tightened around the leather straps, knuckles turning white. She too
          went to fight the elder, who easily parried her sluggish punches with
          ease.
        </p>

        <p>
          Evelyn also came forward. She brandished her katana as she
          concentrated on the elder's open spots, striking with her sword.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>However, Sigfor didn't even move and blocked her with his spear.</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, Oliver jumped onto him from behind while he was blocking
          Evelyn's sword. He aimed for Sigfor's head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor sensed him and bent his head backwards, making Oliver's sword
          pass by him by just a hair's distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Damn brat! He is really coming to get the kill!' Sigfor smirked. He
          liked that sort of decisiveness and ruthlessness.
        </p>
        <p>A sharp dagger came flying towards the back of his neck.</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor moved his free hand behind his back and caught the dagger with
          two fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Not bad,' he thought as he threw the dagger away and looked at Nadia
          standing some distance away, her eyes without expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          'As expected from the heirs of the Mystic Purge Clan, always so
          ruthless and indifferent.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Not bad,' he thought as he threw the dagger away and looked at Nadia
          standing some distance away, her eyes without expression.
        </p>

        <p>
          'As expected from the heirs of the Mystic Purge Clan, always so
          ruthless and indifferent.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He liked that trait of this clan. They never hesitated to kill their
          enemies. While his principles did not align well with the Mystic Purge
          Clan's principles, he still held some level of admiration for the
          latter.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was obvious that he hated how they would even sacrifice their
          allies and comrades to achieve victory, but their decisiveness in
          situations and tactics were top-notch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel attacked him again. This time, Sigfor kicked his stomach,
          throwing him back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Pfft!" Daniel coughed up some spit as the air in his lungs almost
          vanished with that kick.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took continuous deep breaths to steady himself. He felt
          disappointed at having such a gap in their abilities and power, but he
          knew it made sense. Otherwise, how would Sigfor have been qualified to
          tutor them in the first place?
        </p>
        <p>
          He heard Sigfor say, "Focus on one technique at a time. Don't act
          smart and use all of them at once. You cannot defeat me as you are
          right now. So push that thought out of your mind and focus on
          improving yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel gritted his teeth. He had to accept that he really could not
          touch the old man. He had to focus on improving his techniques first.
          The elder was right when he said that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Remember, this is not just about attacking. Learn to read your
          opponent, understand their movements, and adapt. Now, come!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haah!" He weakly got up and flexed his muscles as energy filled his
          core. He was now using espera to try and combat the old man.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in the end, it did not matter at all. The old elder, who
          looked weak from the front, was not weak at all. He easily countered
          it with his spear and threw him back again.
        </p>
        <p>It was very frustrating to be wrapped up so easily.</p>

        <p>
          The others did not stop either for Daniel and launched attacks of
          their own while Sigfor blocked them and parried back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweat poured down their faces, mixing with the dirt and blood from
          minor cuts. Each failed attempt only fueled their determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only Alphonso was the odd one out, watching from the side
          uncomfortably.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber's words kept ringing in his ears continuously. Maybe he wanted
          to deny that she was right.
        </p>
        <p>
          Biting his lip, he watched them train under Sigfor's guidance, despite
          the unfair advantage they were having in a spar with the old elder.
        </p>
        <p>
          He clutched the spear in his hand tightly, his knuckles turning pale.
          He watched every second pass by with conflicted emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          One part of his mind said to jump in and join his friends, while his
          heart remained stubborn and refused to follow such a crude way of
          training.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then that Sigfor's voice, as calm as water, sounded as he
          addressed him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There's nothing to think about. If you believe that I will be
          defeated by the likes of you brats, then I would not be a veteran from
          the borders for nothing. If you actually think that, then you are
          quite foolish. It's not etiquette but rudeness to underestimate your
          opponent during a battle."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did I ask for your opinion, boy?" he asked, wondering when Alphonso
          had heard him ask for his opinion.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor blocked Evelyn's katana as he finished saying what he wanted
          to. If even after all this, Alphonso was not able to realize that the
          opportunity was right in front of him, then he would not help him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a clan heir. Despite his age, there were things that he should
          be able to deduce on his own. There was no need for him to intervene.
          This was the simple logical thought process that he needed to build.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weight of the spear grew heavier in Alphonso's hand. He stared at
          his reflection in the polished blade, searching for the courage he
          needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, Alphonso still did not move and listened to his heart. He
          quietly left the area and went to a corner to train on his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor could not help but feel disappointed in him. Nonetheless, he
          was not there to babysit him. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>If this was what he had decided, then so be it.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 160 &nbsp;Summoning spirits for weapons?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 160</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor continued to polish the kids over the next few days, making
          them realize improvements through constant spars.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweat dripped from their brows as they lunged and parried, each clash
          of metal echoing through the training yard.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were geniuses, quickly learning from their mistakes and
          correcting them in the next attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each sparring session became a dance of precision and skill, their
          movements growing more fluid with every bout.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a fun experience nonetheless. Laughter and shouts of
          encouragement filled the air, the camaraderie between the kids growing
          stronger with each passing day.
        </p>
        <p>They were still not able to hit him though.</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor moved like a shadow, effortlessly dodging their strikes, his
          eyes gleaming with a certain pride.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most notorious ones in his eyes were Oliver and Daniel when it
          came to wielding weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their strikes were fierce, their eyes focused, every swing of their
          blades driven by a calm and calculated force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of them used weapons as if they were using their limbs, their
          movements always precise and calculated, making him feel a hidden
          intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor could sense their resolve, the fire in their hearts pushing
          them to surpass their limits
        </p>
        <p>
          They might be the closest ones to hitting him once. So he was extra
          careful with the two of them.
        </p>

        <p>
          He watched them with a keen eye, noting their progress and silently
          cheering their growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          After two weeks of continuous day and night training, he gathered them
          again in the hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We have trained quite a lot, and you all have shown considerable
          improvements too. It's not easy to improve so much in such a short
          span of time."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You all are quite good." His voice was steady, but the pride in his
          eyes was unmistakable. After all, they were his unofficial students in
          a way and watching them grow strong made him feel satisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed as he said this. No matter how talented or powerful seniors
          like him were, the juniors would surpass them one day.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now we should move forward and learn how to fight using spirits,"
          Sigfor said, something unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Spirits? Does that mean…?" Evelyn muttered. She was heard by Sigfor
          clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's right. We will be summoning spirits for you to fight with or
          inside your weapons."
        </p>
        <p>
          His words dropped like a bomb on the group's head. Gasps and murmurs
          filled the room as the kids exchanged excited glances.
        </p>
        <p>"SPIRITS!? REALLY!? THIS IS FREAKING AWESOME!"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel was overjoyed as he blurted out. He was craving some
          adrenaline, and this was the perfect opportunity. He could not wait to
          try summoning a spirit. His fists pumped in the air, his eyes shining
          with excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Umm… elder, isn't it quite difficult to summon a spirit? As far as I
          have read in books, it is said that you are required to have strong
          espera and concentration to even connect to the spirit realm.
          According to the texts, it's mentioned that spirits don't even bother
          responding to weak individuals," Alphonso said, adjusting his sleeves
          slightly.
        </p>
        <p>His voice was calm, but a hint of worry was present in his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "What!? Is that true!? I was so ready for it," Daniel frowned and
          looked at him, wondering if it was true. While he didn't doubt
          himself, he was merely a Rank-1 exorcist, which was just the beginning
          of the path of an exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor finally broke the silence. He looked around at their anxious
          faces, a reassuring smile forming on his lips.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's indeed true. However, that is only limited to permanent spirit
          summoning when forming contracts. Instead, we will perform a partial
          summoning to temporarily borrow the strength of a spirit. This is
          relatively easy, and even kids like you should be able to do it to
          some extent," he paused for a moment as he looked at them.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of them were geniuses. Normally, a kid would not be able to do it.
          However, they were not normal kids either. He had confidence that they
          could do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course, it will not be as effective and potent as a permanent
          contract with a spirit. It will be far paler in comparison to that.
          But for dire situations, even borrowing the strength of a spirit
          temporarily could change the tides," he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Spirits are not physical beings. They exist in spiritual form only.
          Their own strength is not noteworthy. However, we as exorcists bear
          the potential to bring out the most of their powers, and thus we form
          contracts with them."
        </p>
        <p>
          He tapped his desk as he continued, "Spirits have always loathed
          demons and ghosts. This is also one of the reasons that ancient
          spirits were willing to come out of their realms and help humans push
          them back, even if it meant forming a contract." n/ô/vel/b//in dot
          c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          "Spirits are beings closest to elements. There are spirits belonging
          to each element in existence. The bearer of the element will find
          themselves more drawn towards the spirits affiliated with their
          element than others."
        </p>
        <p>
          "However, don't get excited just yet. Spirits are beings who are able
          to see through things most humans can't, which is your inner self," he
          said, stroking his long beard.
        </p>
        <p>"Inner self? What's that?" Amber questioned.</p>
        <p>
          "Inner self is the true essence of who you are," he explained. "It's
          your thoughts, feelings, and the core of your being that make you
          unique. While we often hide our true selves from others, spirits can
          see this inner self clearly. They understand your true nature, your
          strengths, weaknesses, and even your hidden desires."
        </p>
        <p>"Damn! That's a breach of my privacy!" Daniel exclaimed in shock.</p>
        <p>The room erupted in laughter, the tension easing slightly.</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
