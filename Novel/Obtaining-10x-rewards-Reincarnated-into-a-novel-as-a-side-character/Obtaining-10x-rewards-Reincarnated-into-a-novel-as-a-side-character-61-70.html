        <h2>Chapter 61: Elder's thoughts</h2>
        <p>Chapter 61</p>
        <p>'These people are too noisy.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver couldn't help but feel speechless at their stupidity. They had
          sharp tongues and liked to lick the boots of stronger people.
        </p>
        <p>Something you'd expect from the children of vessel families.</p>
        <p>
          It was not that he blamed them; they were children and were raised in
          that way.
        </p>
        <p>
          How could they know what was right and what was wrong? It was their
          parents' fault that they raised them as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, if they mess with him too much, he will simply teach them a
          lesson.
        </p>
        <p>"Look! The elders are here!"</p>
        <p>Oliver looked and saw a white-bearded man arrive at the scene.</p>
        <p>
          He had a straight back and sharp gaze; his aura was powerful and
          intimidating, truly worthy of being an elder of the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          He subconsciously used [Cosmic Void Gaze] to observe deeper into the
          elder's true powers and instantly was met with a strong and radiant
          light.
        </p>
        <p>
          He squinted his eyes; the espera the elder contained was enormous! He
          could not look without squinting at the direction.
        </p>
        <p>'However...'</p>

        <p>
          It was still not as strong as Jenna's espera, not by a close shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her espera was like a mountain, it was so bright and powerful that he
          could not even look in that direction without getting blinded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder frowned; no sooner did he arrive, he felt a very unpleasant
          sense of discomfort for some reason...
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but look at the little children looking at him in
          awe; however, he could not understand the sudden feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if someone was observing him deeply, as if prying into his
          secrets.
        </p>
        <p>
          He neglected the feeling first as he was unable to sense any
          abnormality and focused on the children gathered before him; today was
          an auspicious day and any carelessness on his end would result in a
          heavy punishment.
        </p>
        <p>Even Miss Nadia was present to participate in the Demon hunt.</p>
        <p>
          "Greetings! Elder!" A lot of the children instantly bowed their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          This elder was a powerhouse in this world of exorcists and demons;
          even their family heads would not dare to disrespect them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing the obedience of the children, the elder was satisfied and
          nodded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Raise your heads; you are the proud talent that the clan raised. Show
          your worth and make us proud."
        </p>
        <p>
          He said a few complimentary words; looking at the group, the heirs of
          the main family did not bow to him like others.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze narrowed as he saw a boy with white hair and beautiful
          gem-like eyes, sharing a deep resemblance to Nadia...
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he knew about Oliver; as a clan elder, he was responsible
          to learn about every heir properly for the sake of the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unexpectedly, a waste was also born in the patriarch's bloodline which
          shocked him and others quite a lot, but given Nadia's dark title and
          huge talent, they did not pay him much attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          But suddenly, they were asked to invite him to the demon hunt as
          well... by someone very special.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was confusing and they were all quite appalled at the order from
          that entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, they did not refuse and instantly let the servants inform
          him too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, they put the capable ones to another task, gather every bit
          of information about Oliver since he was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about what activities he had been doing recently, what
          sort of plays he has been into and what secrets he was carrying with
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The special entity who had ordered them was the clan guardian herself!
        </p>
        <p>
          Why would the clan guardian suddenly show interest in the unknown
          low-profiled boy?
        </p>
        <p>
          It couldn't be that she just wanted to retain the tradition of the
          clan alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          They refused to believe that. If they were so naive then they would
          not have been the members of the top five clans at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          They did question the guardian but she did not elaborate her plans or
          anything.
        </p>
        <p>Sure enough something was being cooked.</p>
        <p>They became sure of it after investigations results were out.</p>
        <p>
          The boy Oliver, he was changing every day, visiting the clan market
          regularly, purchasing many strange items regularly.
        </p>

        <p>
          From the reports, it was said that he had purchased a variety of
          weapons from different blacksmiths, in addition to that, he also
          purchased many martial art techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          And from the maids, it was clear that he was training in his courtyard
          every day as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          From this, it did not take them long to join dots and come to realize
          that he had started to train on the path to become a physical
          exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bit surprising since they did not expect this turn of events but it
          was not too big of a deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone knew whether they wanted to agree or not that physical
          exorcists would always be inferior to spiritual or espera exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there were many great exorcists in the physical path but
          not every exorcist following that path had the talent or dedication to
          be like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, even espera exorcists could train in that path and gain
          double advantage in that aspect.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, they felt it was fine as long as Oliver was able to prove
          himself more useful to the clan in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at Oliver's blank expression, the elder could not help but
          feel disappointed, no respect, no idea what was going on, lost in his
          own world.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that Oliver did not have a proper attitude fitting for an
          exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could be seen that he had a biased opinion; he did not care when
          the other main heirs refused to bow but he was particularly judgmental
          when Oliver was lost in his thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver himself was not aware of the elder's state of mind and even if
          he knew about it, he wouldn't care much.
        </p>
        <p>
          You were an elder, but what actions did you have to be acknowledged as
          one?
        </p>
        <p>
          Power? Sure. But the true respect one has towards an elderly person
          cannot be gained just by that.
        </p>
        <p>Did he personally guide him when he was isolated by the clan?</p>
        <p>Did he provide him with any resources when he needed them?</p>
        <p>
          Did he provide any techniques belonging to the clan when he wanted to
          improve?
        </p>
        <p>
          Did they care for his growth before the clan guardian announced his
          participation?
        </p>
        <p>No.</p>
        <p>
          So he had all the reason to not care about the elder's opinions or
          reputation.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 62 &nbsp;The demons! Secrets of past...</h2>
        <p>Chapter 62</p>
        <p>
          "All the children are now here. I will now proceed to brief you all
          about the event. First of all, the event will be happening in a forest
          this year, a forest owned by the clan."
        </p>
        <p>
          "After that, we will be assigning you with a sealing talisman
          specially made by our best experts; use that carefully to capture the
          demon… once used, it would not be usable again. If you feel that you
          have defeated a strong demon, then use it. If you feel that you can do
          better then kill the demon and move forward."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The test duration would be 1 day. As soon as the time limit is over,
          you will be directly brought out of the forest no matter what. Onto
          the next matter, competition is good but threatening the life of
          others intentionally will lead to harsh punishments and
          disqualifications. Of course, if you try to kill another candidate,
          prepare for the worst."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You will all be supervised by elders of the clan. Your performance
          will be assessed properly, so if you're thinking of cheating in this
          then I advise that you better give up before getting demotion."
        </p>
        <p>
          He paused and looked at the dazed faces of the children before him; he
          further added.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The highest level of a demon that you would find in that forest would
          be a Minor-level demon."
        </p>
        <p>Hearing this, the crowd had mixed expressions.</p>
        <p>Whispering started again,</p>
        <p>"Minor-level? That's it?"</p>

        <p>
          "Are they underestimating us? We belong to one of the five greatest
          clans."
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is humiliating! Just a Minor-level demon? They should be as easy
          as catching chickens!" A hot-blooded guy said.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey, maybe there's a catch…"</p>
        <p>
          "What catch? I was expecting to face at least a Mid-level demon! I
          even bragged about it to my little brother…" A girl sneered and said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tch! I even brought my ancestor's old sword that he used to use when
          he was a kid; the blood of a minor-demon would stain its reputation."
          Another dumb-looking child said.
        </p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          "Who cares about your ancestor's sword? I am fighting for my own
          pride! I want to be noticed by the main heirs! At that time, my family
          would directly soar to heavens if I am accepted by a main heir."
        </p>
        <p>"That's true…"</p>
        <p>
          Hearing the murmurs around him, Oliver realized that these kids were
          too naive.
        </p>
        <p>He wondered if they had even studied about demons or not?</p>
        <p>A minor-level demon was easy to hunt? It was making him laugh.</p>
        <p>
          Did they really think that the clan made this event without any prior
          research or experimentations? The elder clearly said that the
          highest-level demon that they could find in the forest would be a
          minor-level demon.
        </p>

        <p>
          This meant that even the demons weaker than that level would be
          difficult for them to handle on their own.
        </p>
        <p>They clearly did not understand how tough a demon could be.</p>
        <p>
          He had the knowledge from the novel and knew about the class system
          that the demons followed very strictly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Minor Demon: These were the weakest of demons, often summoned by
          inexperienced summoners or occurring naturally in areas with low
          espera. They possess minimal power and were easily dispatched by
          skilled exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's right, these demons required a trained novice exorcist to deal
          with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And they, mere children with no prior exorcism training were going to
          face that entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          A demon was a being with the ability to conduct espera as simple as
          breathing. They were born with more espera as compared to average
          humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ferocious and aggressive, they were depicted as cruel beings, feasting
          on the flesh and blood of humans, they endlessly devoured and grew
          strong in their life.
        </p>
        <p>
          These demons ate the flesh and drank the blood of humans and gained
          more strength. Every time, they consumed a human, they would grow
          stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they killed an exorcist and devoured their bodies, they would grow
          even more powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, this was a great concern for the first generation of
          exorcists centuries ago…
        </p>
        <p>
          If they fought, there would be casualties and the demons would grow
          more powerful from the dead bodies of their comrades.
        </p>

        <p>
          Thus they came up with a solution and that was to disintegrate or
          destroy the bodies of their fellow exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          A painful thing to do… expecting to destroy the body of a comrade that
          once fought alongside you was not easy for anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was for the survival of humanity… At that time, it was either
          now or never.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they did not take this step then the very existence of humanity
          would be at extinction.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a heavy heart, they started to disintegrate the bodies of
          exorcists that fell in battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this proved quite useful too as the exorcists started to slowly
          push back against the demons. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          But it was getting harder and harder to achieve this as the demons
          also realized this strategy of theirs and started to hoard the corpses
          as soon as they killed a bunch.
        </p>
        <p>
          This led the exorcists to develop another cruel strategy for these
          clever demons…
        </p>
        <p>
          With a 'certain' technique, they started to develop themselves in such
          a way that their bodies soon turned into a lethal poison for the
          demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their blood, their flesh, their espera, all of it soon became a curse
          for the demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as the demons would dare to eat them after their deaths, the
          terrifying poison would immediately destroy them both physically and
          mentally.
        </p>
        <p>It would directly cripple them forever.</p>
        <p>
          And this poison method was so effective that till this date in the
          future, no demon was able to counter this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcists kept the poison and the technique a strongly guarded
          secret, even among the exorcist community, very few were aware of the
          actual method and the rest were just fed the mild version of that
          poison.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was simple, the weaker the exorcist, the milder the dose, if the
          exorcist grew stronger, then they would naturally be told more things.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was reasonable since the weaker exorcists would provide less power
          to demons and thus were given a lesser dose.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the bodies of stronger exorcists would tremendously benefit the
          demonic being so they would need to be allocated more of the dosage.
        </p>

        <h2>
          Chapter 63 &nbsp;The demonic familiar and the beginning of the test!
        </h2>
        <p>Chapter 63</p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, this poison method worked well, and now humanity and
          demonic forces were on an almost equal standing for a very long period
          of time.
        </p>
        <p>Neither side was gaining an advantage… Nôv(el)B\\jnn</p>
        <p>
          It was clear that the poison method worked very well, but the method
          to disintegrate the bodies of exorcists was still followed in some
          areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was now frowned upon slightly now that humanity has advanced so
          much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there were some stupid normal people who felt that this was
          immoral and protested in the normal human cities against this too.
        </p>
        <p>It was a pity…</p>
        <p>
          The strong ones of the past had created a peaceful time now and
          allowed them to live comfortably without any worries.
        </p>
        <p>
          With exorcists acting as guard dogs at the borders and facing
          bloodthirsty and cruel demons on a daily basis, they enjoyed an easy
          life in the cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were oblivious and unaware, and barely any of them had deep
          knowledge about the past of human-demon wars.
        </p>
        <p>They had forgotten about the cruelty of demons and their tyranny.</p>

        <p>
          They had forgotten the bloody sacrifice their ancestors had given.
        </p>
        <p>
          Destroying the corpse of your comrade, destroying the body of your
          friend, disintegrating the body of your loved ones… did they think
          that exorcists enjoyed doing such acts?
        </p>
        <p>
          The modern generation of normal humans had forgotten that even
          exorcists had a heart and wanted to live with peace, without risking
          their lives.
        </p>
        <p>Exorcists were also humans in the end…</p>
        <p>
          Some knew of this and respected that, but there were always those who
          didn't know any better and termed this act of body disintegration as
          cruel and inhuman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inhuman? Calling the people who helped them maintain the concept of
          humanity inhuman was ridiculous.
        </p>
        <p>Exorcists were beings with powers beyond comprehension.</p>
        <p>
          They lived isolated from normal humans knowing the conflict that would
          arise if mixed together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jealousy, envy, and hatred were something easily gained by humans
          after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in the times they lived in, a conflict among themselves was the
          last thing anyone wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not when they could gain an advantage over demons any moment or lose
          an advantage any moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          A Minor-level demon required a formally trained novice exorcist to
          deal with them at the least.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although they were the weakest among the demons, they were still
          incomparably agile and stronger than normal humans.
        </p>

        <p>
          Their bodies were tough, and they were bloodthirsty, giving them a
          savage style of fighting. They would not hesitate to tear apart a weak
          human kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          And these children believed that they could subdue a demon of that
          level with their flashy and expensive tools.
        </p>
        <p>It was a pity that they were not better than this.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver could tell that some of the quieter kids had a more serious
          expression—possibly aware of the threat as much as him.
        </p>
        <p>"Silence!"</p>
        <p>
          The elder announced, accompanied by a light wave of his strong espera,
          shutting every bit of chatter in the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          The espera felt heavy upon the shoulders and was pressuring them into
          silence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt the espera and was equally pressured as others, he felt
          strained just as others.
        </p>
        <p>
          From his side-view, he could see some of them being normal even under
          the burst of espera, thanks to their inherent abundant espera
          repelling the force.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was still doing better than many due to his superior physical
          powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling the absolute silence, the elder narrowed his eyes and said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You fools, don't dare to take a demon lightly ever in your lifetime,
          underestimate one and lose your life. You are future exorcists and
          must engrave it in your mind and heart that no matter how weak a demon
          may seem, never ever take it lightly!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder's words resounded in the silent surroundings, making the
          children nod slowly while trembling a bit.
        </p>

        <p>
          They all felt a chill when the serious words fell into their ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Oliver could still see unwillingness in the eyes of some
          kids, not wanting to accept the fact that they would not be able to
          handle a minor demon on their own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the elder spotted that but did not say anything, such children
          think were too arrogant and would learn their lesson soon in their
          field.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Anyways, that is that. I will now be taking you all to the forest,
          bear in mind that you will be all observed by the elites of the clan.
          You must be on your best conduct in this event. If you perform well,
          an elder might consider taking you under their wing… Or it's also
          possible that you can directly serve under a main heir in the future
          based on your performance."
        </p>
        <p>Click!</p>
        <p>The elder clicked his fingers producing a short sound.</p>
        <p>
          As the elder clicked his fingers, a sharp sound pierced the air,
          prompting every onlooker to crane their necks skyward. A cacophonous
          screech tore through the atmosphere, heralding the arrival of a
          monstrous presence. A colossal shadow eclipsed the gathering, casting
          a pall over the crowd as they beheld the fearsome sight above.
        </p>
        <p>
          High above, a massive demonic bird loomed, its wings spanning the
          heavens like a dark omen. Its feathers, as black as midnight, seemed
          to absorb the very light around them, imbuing the creature with an
          aura of dread. Crimson eyes glowed with an otherworldly intensity,
          fixating on the mortals below with a hunger that chilled the soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          With each beat of its wings, the air thrummed with power, and the
          creature's malformed beak parted, unleashing a roar akin to a roaring
          inferno,
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of a roaring fire escapes the creature's deformed nostrils
          set within a curved nose. From its curved nose, deformed nostrils
          expelled plumes of smoke, adding to the aura of menace that surrounded
          the demonic avian.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creature descended with an ominous grace, its presence casting a
          long shadow over the land below.
        </p>
        <p>The elder said looking at the fearful expressions,</p>
        <p>
          "This is my familiar, a demonic bird, it's from a species called Ochre
          Flash, I am sure that many of you have never heard of it. It's a
          powerful demonic being with strong control over the fire element. And
          today, it'll serve as our transport."
        </p>
        <p>
          With a cold voice, the elder directly climbed on top of the still bird
          and gazed below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the strong-willed children did not delay and strode forward
          with tense steps, these children particularly included Nadia, the 2nd
          brother, Oliver, and a few from Vassal families.
        </p>
        <p>
          They did not ask for any help and climbed up the creature with a brave
          heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder acknowledged them with a nod, he had not told them yet but
          the test had already begun.
        </p>
        <p>Those smart enough should be able to tell this.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 64 &nbsp;Familiar? Entering the forest!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 64</p>
        <p>
          The first and foremost thing was for them to overcome their fear of
          demonic presence; the malicious espera induced fear in those with
          weaker hearts and minds.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the children from the proud clan, they must not be influenced by
          this at all, or else they will barely be able to restrain themselves
          in a forest filled with demonic presence and malicious espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver assumed a seat in the middle, his heart was beating wildly with
          every second; he was brave only because of the assurance that the
          ominous bird would not attack them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The malicious espera was overwhelming and induced chills down his
          spine; not to mention the bloodthirsty eyes of this demonic creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          For him, someone used to a peaceful environment, this was a tough
          experience to say the very least.
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought with some astonishment, this bird was really feathery, its
          back was quite cushiony too, and he felt comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he was not wrong, at the academy, they conducted familiar summoning
          too; he'll make sure to get himself a wonderful familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image of a fat white cat suddenly appeared in his mind; in the
          image, the cat was yawning and scratching its belly, looking really
          annoying.
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head and focused on the crowd at the ground.</p>
        <p>
          He looked down and saw the third sibling pair was still down, not
          daring to move much; they were still stunned by the presence of the
          demon.
        </p>

        <p>He sneered; it would be a pity if they get left behind.</p>
        <p>
          He could tell that the test must have already begun given the
          nonchalant expression on the elder's face.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder would have helped the children climb up by now had it not
          been for the test. This was also one of the reasons that he quickly
          climbed up to avoid being left out.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this went on, he felt that half of the children present would get
          eliminated in this step only—not even getting a chance to hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked down and also saw the kid who had brought his ancestor's
          sword shivering in his boots and felt quite speechless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just now, he was bragging about staining his ancestor's sword with the
          blood of demons, and now he was quivering in his pants.
        </p>
        <p>He was not going to piss himself, was he?</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked over suspiciously… fortunately, it was not the case or
          it'll turn into a cursed memory for the kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some minutes passed as more and more children mustered up the courage
          and walked up to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, out of 40 children, only 27 were able to successfully
          climb up the demon bird.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not a bad number; this showed the courage and strength of the younger
          generation of the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder glanced at the remaining children and disdainfully said,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmph, you all are disqualified from the hunt; you are not worthy
          enough to bear the name of our great clan yet."
        </p>

        <p>
          He flicked his sleeves, and the demonic creatures screeched as it
          started to fly high in the sky, its wings generating powerful wind
          currents with every flap.
        </p>
        <p>
          The current was strong, and they should have rolled down to the ground
          due to it, but unexpectedly, they remained seated in their positions,
          the wind seemingly not even affecting them.
        </p>
        <p>'Is the elder's doing?'</p>
        <p>
          He wondered, using the special eyes, he saw them enveloped in the
          elder's espera—covering them like a blanket in a dome shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wow! Look below! We're so high above the ground!" n/o/vel/b//in dot
          c//om
        </p>
        <p>A kid could not help but exclaim in surprise.</p>
        <p>"I am having motion sickness…"</p>
        <p>
          "I-I… This is nothing for me-! I even cleared the elder's hidden test.
          I-I am smart and powerfu-UGH!"
        </p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>The elder remained silent upon hearing such discussions.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, the younger generation was always the noisiest one.</p>
        <p>
          His earlier impression of them for being courageous decreased
          slightly.
        </p>
        <p>"Look-! The forest-!"</p>

        <p>
          After around ten minutes of high-speed travel, they had finally
          arrived at the site where the test was going to take place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demonic bird landed gracefully on the ground near the forest
          entrance, letting the children climb down one by one.
        </p>
        <p>They immediately noticed many other elders nearby observing them.</p>
        <p>
          In the presence of so many elites, it was natural that all of them
          felt some pressure on their shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they could prove themselves and their strength through this hunting
          event, then their future would be set on an easier path with more
          resources and influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder who had been with the children so far looked at the others,
          and upon receiving the signal, he told the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright, here are your sealing talismans," He handed each one of them
          a paper with some runes inscribed on top of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Use them wisely; they are precious and would only work once. The
          sooner you use this, the sooner your hunt will be over."
        </p>
        <p>
          After making sure that everyone was equipped with one talisman and
          their respective weapons that they had brought over, he said,
        </p>
        <p>
          "On my signal, all of you will enter the forest! As soon as you step
          foot inside, your test and the hunt will begin. Beware the elites are
          watching so don't try something that will cause you trouble later."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, elder!"</p>
        <p>"Go!"</p>
        <p>
          The elder signaled, and instantly all of the present participants
          rushed inside the green forest ahead of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was also among them, and the first thing he did was to separate
          himself from the other participating children.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew the closer he was to others, the more his chances of catching
          a good demon as his prey would decrease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but he might even get attacked by the other candidates.
          Sure, the elder had said that it was against the rules to try to kill
          each other, but he did not say anything about mutual fights and
          injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither did he say about the scenario where one candidate might try to
          steal other's talismans.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quite ambiguous, so he would rather not take the risk and be
          alone.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 65 &nbsp;Hunting the first ever demon!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 65</p>
        <p>
          With some random twists and turns, he had already gained quite a
          distance between himself and the other participants.
        </p>
        <p>ZZZ…</p>
        <p>
          Unzipping his backpack, he retrieved his rapier out of it and held it
          in his left hand while he securely tied the bag on his back.
        </p>
        <p>'First, I should do a warm-up…'</p>
        <p>
          He decided to first get used to a demon and its abilities; he was not
          sure what demons he might encounter and what their abilities would be,
          but one thing he was sure of was that they were all weak.
        </p>
        <p>They were all weaker than a minor-level demon…</p>
        <p>
          Fighting a demon would also help him realize his current stage, how
          well could he handle the demons, and what was his current power level.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would also provide him a general idea about how far he was from
          reaching Rank-1 on his own without Nadia's help.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but sigh; once he received her espera talent, he
          would not need to worry about such things and could have a pace of
          progress of his own too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gripping the handle of the rapier tight, he strode forward with
          suppressed steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would need a place to stay as well in case he was unable to hunt a
          strong demon quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention food; he could survive without food for a day, but
          water is a must thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't want to be distracted while fighting due to thirst or
          starvation.
        </p>

        <p>The demon sealing talisman was in his inner pocket secured.</p>
        <p>Rustle!</p>
        <p>
          Just as he was searching for a demon, his senses picked up a rustling
          sound from a distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          He walked slowly towards the bushes where the sound originated from,
          and his eyes caught a fast-paced shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shadow was quick and rushed towards him; it was full of hostility
          and murderous intent.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was sane and fast; he reacted in the last moment and used the
          rapier's long body to block the attack from the shadow.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly dodged to the side and gained some distance between them
          for safety.
        </p>
        <p>"You're…"</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the shadowy figure; the sunlight slowly revealed its
          features…
        </p>
        <p>
          A loud cry echoed through the chasm, hurting Oliver's ears. Suddenly,
          he saw a scary little creature coming towards him. It had angry eyes
          and made another loud cry. Its head was covered in lots of sharp
          spikes, and its body looked tough with strange armor. It had six legs
          and a long tail with a sharp point that dripped something thick. Huge
          wings spread out from its back, made of glowing bones and flames. The
          creature seemed to get scarier with each moment.
        </p>
        <p>The two enraged eyes stared at him with infernal madness,</p>
        <p>
          Its massive head was scarred all over. A wheezing breath escaped the
          creature's gnarled nostrils set within a pudgy nose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon closer look, he saw the skin on the demon was covered with dull
          looking scales—perhaps acting as an armor of sorts for defense.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creature stepped closer to him; its six legs lumberingly carry its
          wicked body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver remained vigilant, especially of the blade-like tail swirling
          behind it; the thick liquid dripping from the stinger on its tip was
          definitely poisonous for him.
        </p>

        <p>
          Juggling his memories for a second and he was able to identify the
          demon easily, he had studied properly before coming to this forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon was called Malagathor and was more inclined towards the fire
          element as evident from its eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon often uses its tail as a means to hypnotize the weaker prey
          before killing them.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>Another strike from the demon, but he was able to parry it.</p>
        <p>
          The demon's strength was not too bad, but he felt that he was
          stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking a step forward, he rushed straight to the demon who attacked in
          response to the human rushing towards it.
        </p>
        <p>Swish! Clang!</p>
        <p>
          However, at the last moment when the demon's poison-laced sharp tail
          was about to meet him, he used the body of the rapier to block it and
          jump to the demon's right—catching it off-guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without wasting a moment, he thrusted the sharp tip of the rapier with
          a good amount of force—piercing through the demon's eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Screech-!</p>
        <p>
          The demon bellowed in anguish and pain as it hurriedly retreated a few
          steps backward, leaving Oliver surprised. He had thought that the
          demon was done for after being pierced in the head, but unexpectedly,
          it was still alive and kicking.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Even after piercing through its eyes, the demon was able to sustain
          itself... it seems I have to hit the skull deeper...'
        </p>
        <p>
          He was feeling a sense of disgust from the moment he had pierced the
          creature; he was never good with lizards even in his past life, and
          seeing such a large and disgusting demon made him repulsed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sounds of flesh churning when being torn and pierced were
          sickening.
        </p>

        <p>
          He had no intention to attack the lower body of the demon; the armored
          scales on its body were tough and hard to break through, it might even
          damage his expensive rapier.
        </p>
        <p>So he was aiming for the skull only...</p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to give the demon too much time to recover and stabilize,
          he launched a series of continuous attacks, mimicking different styles
          of the rapier engraved into his memories from Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, the demon was agitated as it realized the helplessness it
          was facing against Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instincts went into frenzy as the demon's eyes turned blood red,
          opting more aggression towards the enemy regardless of the weary state
          of the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver smiled; this was what he had expected, when cornered, the
          mindless demons turn aggressive and attack nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he dodged the sharp tail attacks that were aimed to slice apart his
          limbs, he started to notice more and more open areas that the demon
          was vulnerable at.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          The tail collided with the shiny body of the rapier as he twisted his
          body and slid towards the ferocious demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Utilizing the demon's confused state, he pointed the rapier up and
          used considerable to force to pierce the skull of the demon just above
          him in a gruesome manner.
        </p>
        <p>Gurgle... wheeze...</p>
        <p>
          The demon let out a low and painful moan as it took its final breath
          in this world as its body fell to the side.
        </p>
        <p>Thud!</p>
        <p>Oliver quickly got up and made some distance.</p>
        <p>"Ugh-!"</p>
        <p>
          He quickly put a hand over his mouth, preventing himself from puking
          in disgust. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          That was too disgusting, the smell, the unhygienic environment, the
          distorted insides of the demon, and the dark-colored blood...
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly experiencing this torment was a bit much for his brain that
          was used to cleanliness and hygiene of comfort at his clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took him a moment to get himself mentally stable as he finally
          looked at the demon's corpse.
        </p>
        <p>He now had to think about how he should deal with it.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 66 &nbsp;Another demon and another battle</h2>
        <p>Chapter 66</p>
        <p>
          He narrowed his eyes as he closely observed the dead demon in detail.
          n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>It was now bleeding a darker version of normal human's red blood.</p>
        <p>
          It smelled pungent just like sulfur, the smell of rotten eggs to be
          specific.
        </p>
        <p>
          He moved closer and carefully eyed the dull-looking scales on its
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I would like to have them, but I don't have the tools necessary for
          it to be extracted…'
        </p>
        <p>
          He pondered with a thoughtful look on his face; he was sure that there
          were some places in the clan market that bought and sold demon parts
          for a good price.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he managed to gather some of the demon parts, he could later sell
          them and solve the money problem temporarily too.
        </p>
        <p>
          But unfortunately, he did not have any experience in butchering demons
          or extracting valuable parts…
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither did he have any tools for that purpose at the moment; his bag
          space was limited, and he didn't want to be restricted at the test
          entrance for carrying too much stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed and looked ahead at the dense bushes; if he did not handle
          the corpse of this demon soon, then the blood and smell would attract
          other predators nearby and that would turn into a huge problem for him
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a demon that is lower than a minor-rank demon, it's weak and has
          not even formed a proper core, it's useless in all aspects apart from
          its body parts."
        </p>

        <p>He said to himself as he started to drag the corpse to the side.</p>
        <p>
          "It's a demon that is lower than a minor-rank demon, it's weak and has
          not even formed a proper core, it's useless in all aspects apart from
          its body parts."
        </p>
        <p>He said to himself as he started to drag the corpse to the side.</p>
        <p>
          As for the blood, to cover the blood, he used nearby materials such as
          dirt, leaves, and rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would have preferred if there were water or fire available to
          completely erase, but for now, there was neither so he could only mask
          the scent using fragrant flora nearby and reduce the visibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now onto the corpse, he dragged the corpse with him to some
          considerable distance from the scene; he could dig a shallow grave for
          the demon, but it was too much effort and a waste of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since burying the demon was out of options, he used the heavy rock
          debris and branches and leaves to camouflage it and minimize the
          scent.
        </p>
        <p>
          This reduced the likelihood of attracting predators and demons to
          their vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>'Fuck, I have the mind of a killer!'</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but secretly exclaim at how proficient he was for
          his first kill…
        </p>
        <p>
          His brain worked many ways out to hide the corpse and blood… was he
          always this dark?
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head to rid of such thoughts and focused onto other
          things.
        </p>
        <p>It was time to hunt more and more demons.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not stop and went around carefully with his hand holding
          the rapier tightly; his senses were on alert for any potential sneak
          attacks from a demon or another contestant.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was vigilant at the same time ambitious to hunt a good demon to get
          into ranking and obtain the fruitful reward from the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rewards were quite good, and he was tempted to get his hands on
          one.
        </p>
        <p>Screech!</p>
        <p>
          In the dim light of the forests, he saw another creature, malicious
          intent radiating openly, its form was small and wiry, hunched over as
          if burdened by its own existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its skin was colored in a sickly shade of gray, stretched taut over
          bony limbs, each joint protruding sharply like jagged rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the demon's gaunt face, he felt the demon sneer, its lips
          curled back revealing rows of needle-like teeth, stained with the
          essence of its prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sunken eyes, glowing in the dark… the gaze was filled with a hunger
          born of desperation.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to finish it off, there was a garden of twisted horns fixed on its
          head, small yet sharp.
        </p>
        <p>'Infernal lineage… a Vexlar.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver pointed his rapier forward as he directly attacked the demon
          head-on.
        </p>
        <p>
          This demon although only had power only a fraction of its greater kin,
          it was a cunning but coward demon that would flee once it faced an
          opponent stronger than itself.
        </p>
        <p>Grr...</p>
        <p>
          With a snarl, the demon, though smaller and weaker than others of its
          kind, leaped at him with surprising speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its claws shone in the dim light but Oliver was unmoving and did not
          move, acting as an unbreakable fortress for the small demon—intending
          to show the difference in power.
        </p>

        <p>The demon pounced; its claws were slashing at air with ferocity.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver stepped back, narrowly avoiding the deadly attacks, aggravating
          the demon with annoyance.
        </p>
        <p>With a swift thrust, he aimed at the demon's abdomen.</p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>His rapier sliced through the air like a viper striking forth.</p>
        <p>
          The demon twisted, narrowly avoiding the blow, but he had expected it.
        </p>
        <p>His movement was fluid as he kept attacking from all directions.</p>
        <p>
          As the demon lunged at him again, Oliver moved his body and bent, his
          body especially flexible after all the training.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a parry, he directed the demon's attack toward itself—leaving it
          off balance and highly vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>Crunch! Screech!</p>
        <p>
          Seizing the golden chance, he struck as his rapier hit the mark with a
          satisfying crunch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon howled in pain as it hurriedly recoiled, its form flickering
          in the dim light before slowly disappearing into a cloud of noxious
          ashes—an indication of the demon's infernal lineage.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a small grin on his face, he looked at the pile of ashes; it was
          convenient that he would not have to clean up the corpse and blood for
          this demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made sure to deliberately annoy the demon before so that it would
          not try to escape and keep attacking him and slowly used its own
          attacks to finish it off.
        </p>
        <p>Another battle won!</p>
        <p>
          The efforts he had put and the rewards from the system together were
          finally showing fruits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Handling demons of this level was easy for him; he felt more confident
          in fighting against a minor-level demon now.
        </p>
        <p>
          'This demon's ashes are used in making alchemical creations and should
          sell for some money in the clan's market... but where do I keep them?'
        </p>
        <p>He pondered as he looked at the small pile of ashes before him.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 67 &nbsp;They are here!?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 67</p>
        <p>"Well, no choice, I should just carry it in my bag."</p>
        <p>
          He collected the ashes and wrapped them in big leaves, storing them in
          his bag afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spent the next hour searching for a place to stay and rest; the
          forest was definitely big, and there were all sorts of natural spots
          and places to hide.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted a place closer to a water stream if possible so that he
          would not need to travel just to collect water. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          But there was, of course, the risk involved in getting entangled with
          other participants in this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water is an important resource, and there were bound to be people
          vying for it; they must be thinking the same as him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had awakened a water-attributed espera and could quench his thirst
          in dire need but not casually.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a very minimal amount of espera compared to others, and using
          water-attributed techniques would consume a lot of it, thus tiring
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His main goal was to conserve as much energy as possible in order to
          be prepared for any unknown variables.
        </p>
        <p>
          He simply could not afford the luxury to use his espera for the simple
          purpose of quenching his thirst whenever he wanted at the moment.
        </p>

        <p>Having some espera reserves was necessary.</p>
        <p>Gurgle... Gurgle...</p>
        <p>
          It was not long before his ears caught the sound of flowing water.
        </p>
        <p>
          He walked towards the sound's direction, and with some rustling with
          the bushes, he soon found himself face to face with a flowing water
          stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          The water was clean and fresh; he neared the edge and drank a mouthful
          of fresh water.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling refreshed from the earlier bloodshed, he tried to locate a
          nearby shelter for him to spend the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          If possible, he wanted one that was not too far from the water stream.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, after spending another 30 minutes or so, he was able to
          locate an isolated den made out of rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not too deep nor too wide; he could hide himself within it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He decided to make this his spot and brought some larger rocks from
          the surrounding area and shifted them towards the entrance to make it
          look more natural and discrete.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stuffing his loot inside the den, he went out to look for stronger and
          better demons roaming in the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          His goal was to somehow enter the rankings that were eligible to
          receive a reward from the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          His cover was as good as blown; he knew the elders were already aware
          by now that he was training on the path of a physical exorcist so it
          would be foolish not to use this to his advantage and extort some
          rewards.
        </p>

        <p>
          With his thirst quenched and his spirits buoyed, Oliver set about
          gathering supplies for the time ahead. He filled his water flask to
          the brim, ensuring that he would have enough to sustain him during the
          long hours of the hunt. He also gathered edible plants and fruits,
          supplementing his meager rations with the bounty of the forest.
        </p>
        <p>It was a resourceful place, no doubt.</p>
        <p>
          As he worked, Oliver couldn't shake off the feeling of being watched.
          The sensation prickled at the back of his neck, raising the hairs on
          his arms in unease. Glancing around warily, he scanned the surrounding
          foliage for any signs of movement, but saw nothing out of the
          ordinary.
        </p>
        <p>'Am I being too sensitive...?'</p>
        <p>
          He wondered, considering the two demons he fought earlier really made
          him quite on edge—so much so that he was even bothered by the
          continuous splatter of water against rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaking off his paranoia, Oliver forced himself to focus on the task
          at hand. He couldn't afford to let fear cloud his judgment, not when
          his life depended on his ability to stay one step ahead of the demons
          that roamed the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his supplies gathered and his resolve steeled, Oliver set off
          once more into the depths of the forest, his footsteps echoing softly
          against the forest floor. The hunt was far from over.
        </p>
        <p>In the next few hours, he encountered multiple demons.</p>
        <p>
          There was a demon with a lush head of hair adorning its swollen head,
          which itself was as coarse as sandpaper. Its swollen head was fixed on
          top of a small ossified body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another demon he encountered had multiple scars and still-open wounds
          covering its torso, suggesting that it was either being hunted by
          other participants or was being accompanied by other demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          One demon had the build of a tiny organism of blood and smoke with two
          barren eyes and a glacial malice. It had a bulbous head as thick as
          leather and a beak-like nose.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a tough time killing that demon due to its small size and fast
          reactions.
        </p>

        <p>But in the end, he managed to finish it off.</p>
        <p>
          The last demon could have been a good catch, and had he used the
          talisman to seal the demon inside, he could have been worry-free.
        </p>
        <p>
          But his mind was not ready to accept this demon; he believed that he
          could definitely do better than this.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention... that tingling sensation of being watched had
          come once again...
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier at the water stream, he felt it was his delusion and he
          believed so since the sensation disappeared when he left the water
          stream to hunt deeper into the forest, but now suddenly it was back.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time he did not think that it was due to the fact that he was on
          edge due to hunting demons.
        </p>
        <p>Someone was definitely watching him...</p>
        <p>And that someone was close...</p>
        <p>
          Without delaying, he activated [Cosmic Void Gaze] and scanned the
          surroundings once more.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, he made sure to be discreet about it and not let the
          watcher know that he was searching for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not want to alert the observer or observers that he had felt
          their gazes on his back.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were already being quite stealthy with their gazes and had it not
          been for him becoming stronger in the past couple of weeks, he might
          have completely ignored it or missed it.
        </p>
        <p>But now, that was not the case.</p>
        <p>
          He pretended to act naturally and started to handle the corpse, while
          occasionally looking around to see if there were any demons nearby,
          while instead, he was looking for the observers.
        </p>
        <p>And he finally saw it...</p>
        <p>'...Ah.'</p>
        <p>His lips suddenly curled up into a sinister grin.</p>
        <p>'They are finally here.'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 68 &nbsp;His thoughts and unexpected... wariness?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 68</p>
        <p>'They are finally here.'</p>
        <p>
          He mused to himself as his smile couldn't be any broader at the
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly hid his facial expression—not wanting to let the observers
          know his state of mind or expressions.
        </p>
        <p>'I have been waiting for a long time for this moment..'</p>
        <p>
          He craned his neck as he slowly got up from his squatting position.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stretched his arms upwards and performed a basic set of exercises.
        </p>
        <p>
          His posture looked carefree and fearless, as if he were not even
          concerned about the vicious demons in the vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>A careless and improper attitude for an aspiring exorcist.</p>
        <p>_________________</p>
        <p>"Did you see that?" A boy asked his partner.</p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>The other party, however, remained silent.</p>
        <p>
          "I stopped you earlier from engaging in a fight, now do you think that
          I did the right thing?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He once again asked, his tone laced with a hint of sarcasm and anger.
        </p>
        <p>"I-" The other party wanted to say something but stopped.</p>

        <p>Rustle!</p>
        <p>
          The winds blew lightly as the sun rays fell on the duo, revealing
          their features and identities at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the 3rd brother and 3rd sister… the ones who had beaten Oliver
          last time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since they had entered the forest, Shane had been constantly
          bothered by his sister about him stopping her earlier in front of so
          many people.
        </p>
        <p>She felt she had been insulted and wanted revenge.</p>
        <p>
          But he knew better, he was far more rational than her and knew how to
          hold their image in front of others.
        </p>
        <p>She was too impulsive in his opinion.</p>
        <p>
          Shane calmly looked at Oliver and the demonic corpse by his side as
          his mind went back to the time they had entered the forest together.
        </p>
        <p>________</p>
        <p>
          They were initially intending to deal with Oliver as soon as they
          entered the forest, but unexpectedly that guy suddenly rushed in a
          random direction.
        </p>
        <p>This greatly confused him and his sister.</p>
        <p>Was he scared of them?</p>
        <p>
          He might have known that they would be targeting him and decided to
          escape from the crowd and took a random direction.
        </p>
        <p>If not, then this move was quite reckless.</p>
        <p>
          The forest was infested with demons and given his meager strength and
          espera, he was doomed either way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either he met them or the demon, it was a supposed dead end for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not give him a chase at that time because he knew that sooner
          or later, they would cross paths if he was still somehow in one piece.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instead, they focused on their hunts and he even helped his sister
          manage to seal a decent demon for the competition.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could have also gotten a demon but she kept on insisting that they
          wait until they meet that Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>She wanted to get back at him for staring at her.</p>
        <p>
          He did not mind, they can always hunt another demon by the end of the
          hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, they spent the rest of their time searching around for him while
          occasionally dealing with demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, as they were near the water stream, they finally spotted
          him drinking water.
        </p>
        <p>
          His sister wanted to immediately rush and attack him but he stopped
          her.
        </p>
        <p>They discussed it and decided to observe him for some time.</p>
        <p>
          They were on the other end of the water stream and had concealed
          themselves pretty well considering their stealth abilities were their
          expertise.
        </p>
        <p>
          And good for them that they did this because instantly they saw him
          looking around in caution.
        </p>
        <p>This guy was able to feel that someone was watching him!?</p>
        <p>Even though they were so far and stealth.</p>
        <p>
          Shane felt good that they decided to stay low and observe him for some
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered how he had survived for so many hours in the forest given
          his lacking abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          From his earlier experience in teaching Oliver his place… he knew that
          Oliver was a weakling, a pathetic bastard sharing their clan's name.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, they once again lost him as he suddenly sped up deeper inside
          the forest. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to their great distance from him and the obstruction from the long
          water stream, they once again had lost him.
        </p>

        <p>
          His sister was excited that Oliver was still functioning and well—she
          was too enthusiastic to beat him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also had a pang of excitement in his heart when he saw Oliver, his
          hands had been itching for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          While he had not shown his discomfort earlier, he was also quite
          pissed off at Oliver for daring to disrespect them like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          They quickly followed the stream and went to the other side of the
          water where Oliver was some time ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane tried to look for traces he might have left behind while going
          deep into the forest but was unpleasantly surprised when he found
          nothing behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          How could Oliver be so vigilant to not leave any traces behind? He was
          not an expert, should not have the knowledge of erasing traces, nor
          did he train in stealth techniques…
        </p>
        <p>
          They searched thoroughly and in the end his sister did start to find
          minor indications that he might have left behind, she was a genius
          when it came to using espera for stealth techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          No-! They were sure that these traces could only have been from him.
        </p>
        <p>Sure enough, he was feeling weird for nothing.</p>
        <p>
          It must be due to the natural terrain of the forest and their
          inexperience that they did not manage to find much traces.
        </p>
        <p>After an hour or so, they finally found him.</p>
        <p>But the scene they came across was unexpected and stunning.</p>
        <p>He was standing by a demon's corpse.</p>
        <p>
          And it was not a weak demon either, the corpse was torn apart as if
          sliced by a rapier or a blade…
        </p>
        <p>
          Even they would have had some difficulty subduing that demon given its
          tiny frame and fast speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane's eyes shone as he looked at the corpse, it was worth it if he
          could seal the demon in his talisman.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a good demon that could guarantee a spot for him in the top
          rankings.
        </p>
        <p>
          But one thing he was unable to understand, what was this guy Oliver
          doing next to the corpse…?
        </p>
        <p>It couldn't be that he hunted that demon?</p>
        <p>No, it was impossible.</p>
        <p>He refused to believe as such. He still remained cautious.</p>
        <p>He saw him squatting by the demon inspecting the corpse perhaps.</p>
        <p>
          His heart stirred as he felt this demon was going to be sealed by
          Oliver's talisman and not by his…
        </p>

          "There he is…! Shane, this time, no one can stop me from breaking him.
          Do you have anything to say?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The voice of his twin sister brought him back to reality as he glanced
          at Oliver with some wariness.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is this really going to be fine…? Why do I feel so uneasy…?' Shane
          shivered slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt as if he was being stared by the entire sky at the moment. His
          back was covered in chills.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shane!" His sister tugged at him as she saw him dazed, she wanted to
          hurry and teach Oliver a lesson he would never forget, but for some
          reason, her calm brother was acting weird for a while.
        </p>
        <p>'I am feeling nervous? Of what? Of this weakling?'</p>
        <p>Shane gritted his teeth, why was he being like this!?</p>
        <p>Was he a coward? n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om</p>
        <p>No!</p>
        <p>
          He belonged to one of the greatest exorcist clans in the entire world.
        </p>
        <p>
          His blood was divine, his arts were superior, and he was stronger than
          any of his peers!
        </p>
        <p>
          How could he be nervous of facing a pathetic bug they had crushed not
          long ago?
        </p>
        <p>Whether it was now or before, a bug was a bug.</p>
        <p>It cannot compare to someone like them.</p>
        <p>They were superior in every way imaginable.</p>

        <p>
          It was a typical trait that was found in all the children of the
          Mystic Purge Clan.

        <p>They would use strength to establish dominance in all scenarios!</p>
        <p>
          Shane looked at Oliver's back with keen eyes, there was still a hint
          of caution in his eyes but that was soon clouded by the anger and
          greed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at his sister and finally said, "Alright, we will do as you
          say."
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl's tender face broke into a wide smirk as she saw her brother
          agree finally.
        </p>
        <p>Crack!</p>
        <p>
          Cracking her knuckles, she looked down at their target and said, "Then

        </p>
        <p>Why did he not stop looking?</p>

          Because instead of invisible air that was supposed to be in front of

          A sharp pain assaulted his mind as his vision started to blur for a
          moment, his balance shifting.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a feeling of nausea, but he quickly adapted thanks to his prior
          experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          A flood of dense information about the Eternal Twelve Lies Palm
          entered his mind, a series of moves and arts.
        </p>

          He felt slightly dizzy as his muscles and nerves started to shift and
          adjust.

          Popping sounds started to ring in his ears as he felt his bone adjust
          to the experience that came along with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was all due to the terrifying amount of experience that he
          received.
        </p>
        <p>
          His muscular system, nervous system, and organs adjusted to bear the
          power of the technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt slightly happy that he had been regularly training himself or
          this experience would have directly caused his mind to break in pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not imagine how his weak untrained body would have managed to
          bear the sheer stress placed on it due to this technique—he would have
          directly collapsed under this pressure.

        <p>
          Fading Single Deception Strike... This technique allows the user to
          deliver a deceptive blow, appearing to fade from sight just as it
          lands. Its benefit lies in its ability to confuse opponents, making it
          difficult for them to predict the attacker's movements and defend
          against the strike.

        <p>
          This allows the user to conjure twelve potent illusions with a single
          strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each illusion can be shaped into its own form as per the user's will
          and movements—confusing the enemies with a multitude of deceptive
          moves.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's so effective that it's no longer a deception but a straight lie!

          heightened versatility as it can deceive multiple opponents
          simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          It has increased potency too since each illusion has the potential to
          strike independently, making it way more lethal!
        </p>
        <p>'Haha...'</p>
        <p>
          'What a great timing...! I just have the perfect targets to practice
          this on.'
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes narrowed as he felt the two sneaky figures close up to him.
        </p>
        <p>They were now just behind him.</p>
        <p>
          He turned around and was now face to face against the two siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Memories of the past where they had brutally beaten him appeared
          making his blood boil slowly...
        </p>
        <p>"You're here?"</p>
        <p>He looked at the two and said with a smile.</p>
        <p>
          Shane who looked at his unsurprised and calm expression had a burst of
          ominous feeling in his heart once again.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why is he so calm...? Was he expecting us? Was he aware of our
          presence... that can't be...'
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind suddenly thought of countless possibilities but just as he
          was thinking about them, his impulsive sister spoke up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "OH? Look who we have here? It's the little maggot who dared to be
          rebellious against his elder siblings earlier?" She said
          sarcastically.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where are your manners? How about kneeling down and kowtowing to us
          for your rude behavior from earlier? Come on, show your respect!"
        </p>
        <p>
          She said as waves of espera escaped from her body targeting Oliver to
          make him feel a dose of her power.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was expecting him to be thrown back by this, he, a being with
          minuscule espera would not be able to contend against her with
          abundant espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, contrary to her arrogant expectations, the reality was far
          different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver snorted and stood unmoving as he let the espera waves hit him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His body was tough and his strength level was 4, not something that
          could be thrown back with this girl's little espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver stood unshakable, his gaze condescending as he looked at the
          puzzled and surprised face of the girl.
        </p>
        <p>"Respect? Do you deserve it?"</p>

        <h2>Chapter 70 &nbsp;Who's the bug here, 3rd sister?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 70</p>
        <p>"Respect? Do you deserve it?"</p>
        <p>His words directly made her choke on her next words.</p>
        <p>She was really infuriated with him and threatened.</p>
        <p>
          "So it's like this... then it's our duty to instill manners into your
          thick brain, isn't it?"
        </p>
        <p>"Are you capable enough to do that?"</p>
        <p>"I will allow you to lick my feet if you beg right now."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver directly provoked her. The one thing he was good at was
          provoking others, with an arrogant laugh he look at her as if he was
          looking at an insect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure enough his sharp words had an effect as multiple veins popped on
          her forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since her birth till now, she had never been looked down upon by
          anyone. Nor anyone had ever dared to speak to her in this manner.
        </p>
        <p>Such trash talk was really getting to her.</p>
        <p>
          This guy seemed to have forgotten the beating they had given him some
          time ago.
        </p>
        <p>"Good good!"</p>
        <p>She roared.</p>
        <p>
          She could not hold it any longer and lunged at him, her fingers
          curling into a fist.
        </p>
        <p>She was going to use her strength to subdue him now.</p>
        <p>
          Despite her tender age and weak frame, the presence of abundant espera
          in her body automatically had enhanced her powers.
        </p>

        <p>
          So her punch carried a strong force behind it and it was enough to
          hospitalize a normal adult male for several months.
        </p>
        <p>She really intended to cripple Oliver this time for good!</p>
        <p>What about the elder's warnings before the hunt?</p>
        <p>
          That she did not care about too much since all the warning that the
          elder had given were about not killing each other in the demon hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were no rules that stated no mutual fights can occur between two
          or more participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was also no guarantee that they cannot cripple each other
          either—although it was heavily frowned upon by the community.
        </p>
        <p>But who was she? She was one of the main heirs of the clan.</p>
        <p>
          She did not care about the consequences of her actions. Strength rules
          supreme.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a waste anyways, even if she crippled him to a vegetative
          state, no one would care too much.
        </p>
        <p>She rushed up to him and swung her fist at his abdomen.</p>
        <p>Oliver did not wait either, he was not careless this time around.</p>
        <p>
          If he was bold and took her punch directly, he was bound to get hurt.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he could not afford to take that risk given that Shane was also
          there with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally he was at a disadvantage against two espera users with very
          little espera of his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if he took one of them by surprise like he did with the 2nd
          brother, the other one would be there to back up.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was serious and did not hesitate to block the attack using his own
          fist.
        </p>
        <p>He moved and threw a punch at her with a greater force.</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>

        <p>
          The two punches collided and a loud sound of bone hitting bone was
          produced.
        </p>
        <p>"Agh-! You bastard-! How dare you!?"</p>
        <p>
          The 3rd sister could not help but let out a painful groan as she felt
          the impact on her hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          A look of shock appeared in her once proudful eyes as she found it
          hard to comprehend what was going on...
        </p>
        <p>She actually was hurt by a trash...?</p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw his chance as the 3rd sister recoiled from the force of his
          blow. He pressed his advantage, launching into a barrage of punches
          and kicks. His muscles strained with each strike, fueled by fire of
          revenge and adrenaline.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the 3rd sister was no pushover. Despite the pain shooting through
          her hand, she fought back fiercely, channeling her espera into swift
          and precise attacks. Bolts of energy crackled around her fists as she
          aimed for Oliver's vulnerable spots.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had long realized that they had severely underestimated this guy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't knew how but somehow this guy had managed to become this
          strong since the last time they saw him...
        </p>
        <p>
          She was hit multiple times at various body parts and each hit from his
          fist felt as if someone was striking her with a hammer!
        </p>
        <p>It was very painful.</p>
        <p>
          Only she knew how hard it was for her to keep her balance using almost
          all of her espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had never imagined being cornered so badly by a weakling—if that's
          what he was now.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not even given the time to properly think before he attacked
          her, he was really ruthless in his attacks.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could tell at a glance that if she got a serious hit by him, she
          would directly have her bones broken.
        </p>
        <p>He intended to cripple her back!</p>
        <p>
          A burst of anger exploded in her heart when she realized this, she
          refused to be pushed back like this!
        </p>
        <p>
          Their movements became a blur as they exchanged blows, each refusing
          to yield an inch. Oliver's strength was undeniable, but the 3rd
          sister's espera gave her speed and agility beyond that of a normal
          fighter.
        </p>

        <p>Oliver for the first time realized the usefulness of espera.</p>
        <p>
          He, who had superior strength than her in every aspect was being
          equally matched by her as she implied espera into her moves!
        </p>
        <p>This was an eye-opener for him.</p>
        <p>
          It made him realize the difference between the physical exorcist and
          an exorcist with espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Oliver's thirst for revenge began to tip scales in his favor.
        </p>
        <p>
          He slowly started to anticipate her moves, dodging her strikes and
          landing his own with increasing accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          He intentionally hit her spots where she was the least guarded and
          slowly slowed her down.
        </p>
        <p>"Agh-!"</p>
        <p>
          She cried out in severe pain, she could feel her bones crack under the
          intense pressure. It was very painful.
        </p>
        <p>
          With every punch, he felt the satisfaction of gaining ground against
          his opponent. It was addicting feeling as he felt his punches connect
          to her body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scene of her getting bruised by each of his punch overlapped with
          his memory of him getting beaten half to death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver aimed for a strong attack at her, intending to finish her off
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          Just as victory seemed within reach, a new presence entered the fray.
          Shane, the 3rd brother, stepped in between the two with a menacing
          grin. Oliver's expression crumbled slightly as he realized he was
          outnumbered once again.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was so into fighting her that he even forgot about him for a
          second.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was almost night by now as moon had started to appear in the sky...
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver quickly stepped back and made some distance between them in
          order to not get a surprise attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could feel the strength of Shane's hand just a moment ago when he
          had interfered...
        </p>
        <p>He was not weak!</p>
        <p>Neither did he lack espera nor physical power.</p>
        <p>Oliver relaxed his stance unzipped his bag.</p>
        <p>He took out his rapier...</p>
        <p>This was going to get bloody!</p>
