        <h2>Chapter 51: Purchase Successful!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 51</p>
        <p>"500,000 Neden."</p>
        <p>A calm and composed voice rang in the silent hall, stunning many.</p>
        <p>It was Oliver.</p>
        <p>Oliver had bid for the stone unexpectedly?</p>
        <p>
          People turned their heads to look at him and realized it was the same
          person with the suspicious outfit and mysterious powers from earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The auctioneer paused, giving Oliver a look before she quickly said,
        </p>
        <p>"500,000 Neden. Does anyone wish to counter?"</p>
        <p>"Hmph!"</p>
        <p>
          The old man from earlier sneered as he looked at the short Oliver with
          a gaze of disdain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Young and naive, don't know how to appreciate elders' help? This
          generation is useless."
        </p>
        <p>
          Being the old block he was, his thinking naturally matched his age.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some short-sighted people also snickered at that; they felt that they
          had misjudged Oliver from the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed that the boy was just carrying some strength-concealing
          artifact or something to appear more mysterious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people in the audience could not help but feel disdain towards
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the others contemplated his reason for buying the artifact, they
          wondered if he was really naive and just wanted to stand out or if
          there was something deeper...?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt the once-familiar gaze probing him again; he looked
          towards Jenna and through his special eyes read what she was mouthing.
        </p>

        <p>She was asking him what he intended to do with that?</p>
        <p>
          Although it was not her business to know that, he did not say that. It
          couldn't be that she was concerned about him either.
        </p>
        <p>
          A ruthless and clever woman showing concern for him all of a sudden?
          He would never believe that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was possible that she wanted to know if he knew anything related to
          the artifact or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, he wouldn't tell her anything or she'd directly place a bid
          that he would not be able to match.
        </p>
        <p>He mouthed the words,</p>
        <p>'I. Want. To. Stand. Out.'</p>
        <p>And then ignored her.</p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>
          Jenna, who was far above, was stunned after hearing his reasoning.
        </p>
        <p>She knew that it was not this simple.</p>
        <p>
          This little kid, although he looked silly and naive, was very
          money-minded; he was aware of the rates, and his eyes were that of a
          growing merchant.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would not deal in loss, and that stone which everyone was thinking
          was going to cut a loss was suddenly bid by him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Had she not known him, she might also have thought of him as an
          attention-grabbing brat, but not now.
        </p>
        <p>She knew his personality from their interaction last time.</p>
        <p>
          He was a genius when it came to picking trash among treasures; his
          artifact appraising skills were too good!
        </p>
        <p>
          So good that she was willing to invite him to become a true member of
          the Black Codex Federation!
        </p>
        <p>
          He definitely saw something in that stone that she was not able to
          detect.
        </p>

        <p>She wondered if it was another epic-rank artifact in hiding?</p>
        <p>She suddenly had the strong urge to bid against him.</p>
        <p>With her wealth, he would not be able to compete with her at all!</p>
        <p>
          And after purchasing the stone, she could just send it to the top
          appraisers in the Black Codex Federation to get it examined.
        </p>
        <p>
          She once again looked at him and then at the ordinary stone in the
          display box placed on the stage.
        </p>
        <p>She sighed and shook her head.</p>
        <p>"I should have bid for it first..."</p>
        <p>
          She regretted not bidding for it first; now she decided not to bid for
          obvious reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver and she now belonged to the same organization and in a way, he
          was her junior and a child.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she really competed against him, then not only would she worsen her
          ties with him in the future but also be indirectly or directly
          provoking him based on his thinking.
        </p>
        <p>He was too mysterious and was shrouded in a fog of secrets.</p>
        <p>
          His potential was unknown; she did not believe the Mystic Purge Clan's
          evaluation of him being useless.
        </p>
        <p>She always thought of multiple scenarios at the same time.</p>
        <p>
          What if Oliver was extraordinary and the clan simply did not want to
          leak the details about their best heirs to other people in the clan,
          so they just termed him talentless?
        </p>
        <p>
          What if Oliver was hiding something that not even the great clan was
          aware of?
        </p>
        <p>There were many scenarios revolving in her mind.</p>
        <p>
          If such a scenario indeed came true, then she would be making enemies
          with the wrong person.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she had bid before him, then he wouldn't have had any reason to
          blame her, but what's done was done.
        </p>

        <p>
          She decided to place more importance on human resources than materials
          this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          With her calm mind and wits, she had survived and dominated the
          business industries among exorcists; she knew what was more valuable
          to her at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>With a heavy heart, she calmly waited.</p>
        <p>
          Even though she had earlier been suspected by him for being creepy,
          she let it go.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was just that he didn't know his limits and was thus so daring.
        </p>
        <p>How could she, a dignified woman, be a creep?</p>
        <p>
          If he knew her real strength, he wouldn't even dare to look up at her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She shook her head and looked ahead with a straight face, secretly
          suppressing the intrusive thoughts to just bid a very high amount.
        </p>
        <p>___________</p>
        <p>
          "Since there's no one interested in bidding, the item now belongs to
          Number 69! Congratulations, number 69!"
        </p>
        <p>
          She clapped lightly, heaving a sigh of relief that someone was willing
          to buy this piece of junk.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were always such junk materials that would occasionally slip in;
          she had heard from her colleagues about how awkward they would feel
          when no one wanted to buy an item.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had never experienced such a situation before in her time here,
          and it was about to become like that, but fortunately, someone bought
          it. She felt grateful.
        </p>
        <p>She would get more commission now thanks to Oliver!</p>
        <p>
          Later, she would submit a report to the auction head and request that
          they don't accept items through backdoor entries and get them
          appraised properly first.
        </p>
        <p>The crowd had mixed reactions as well.</p>
        <p>"Number 69 is a fool, haha."</p>
        <p>
          "It can't be helped; there are always such attention-grabbers present
          in auctions every year."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're right; he even dared to ignore Mr. Tesshu's advice, a junior
          expert appraiser, haha."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sagara Tesshu was kind enough to let others know about this junk of a
          material, and yet this person number 69 didn't know how to appreciate
          it."
        </p>
        <p>Another person shook his head.</p>
        <p>
          "Forget it; he's either a spoilt child from some noble family or clan
          or just spent his entire savings to buy this junk to look rich. If
          it's the latter, then he will be regretting it soon enough."
        </p>
        <p>It was then that they suddenly felt a chill!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 52: Stone of Sight! The power of future!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 52</p>
        <p>They suddenly felt a chill behind and got uncomfortable all over.</p>
        <p>
          Looking over, the masked person was looking in their direction, and
          his eyes, for some reason, felt intimidating and overbearing.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if they were being stared down by the entire sky!</p>
        <p>
          They felt as insignificant as tiny ants under the mountainous
          intimidation from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the gaze was so overbearing that they felt they were being stared
          down by the stars! Always beneath...
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed that they shouldn't comment more or they would get into big
          trouble, so they quickly shut themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, on the other hand, focused back on the stage. He knew these
          sort of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were all bark but no bite. They would fear strong and bully the
          weak.
        </p>
        <p>He used only light intimidation and silenced them instantly.</p>
        <p>Calmly, he assessed the situation.</p>
        <p>He had purchased the artifact...</p>
        <p>
          The artifact everyone was considering useless and uncommon rank...
        </p>

        <p>An item that made others feel that he was trying to show off.</p>
        <p>
          Something that a junior expert appraiser from the forging association
          advised against... he bought it.
        </p>
        <p>Why? Just why would he purchase such trash?</p>
        <p>Simple, because it was not trash.</p>
        <p>But a gem in the covering of garbage that they could not see.</p>
        <p>
          This artifact was called [Stone of Sight] and was an item that was
          originally possessed by the high priestess of the Vasa family in the
          story's original plotline.
        </p>
        <p>She was the future companion of the protagonist of the story.</p>
        <p>
          In the novel, they both worked as allies for some time before
          departing. She was someone who fought alongside the protagonist and
          helped exterminate demons who threatened the very concept of humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was someone with the power to predict the future to some extent
          and the source of her powers originated from this [Stone of Sight].
        </p>
        <p>
          It was this artifact that helped her awaken her latent potential and
          rise above other exorcists. She could divine events that were going to
          happen at some point and change them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Stone of Sight] was the original family heirloom of the Vasa
          family, a once renowned family that participated in the great demon
          war as a vassal family for the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were a family of seasoned exorcists, having multiple achievements
          and was also the place that once birthed many powerhouses during the
          Dark War.
        </p>
        <p>
          They fell from grace when their acting patriarch at that time fell
          against the demons in the battlefield.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, other families rose above and took their place, chipping away
          at every prestige they once were proud of.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was how the world worked; if you were not powerful enough to
          defend yourself and your family, then you could only step down and let
          others rise above you.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were countless other families vying for the attention of the
          Mystic Purge Clan, wanting to earn the status of a vassal family, and
          they would do anything to rise above their competitors, schemes,
          plots, blood, whatever was possible.
        </p>
        <p>All for the mere attention and recognition of the great clan!</p>
        <p>
          The Mystic Purge Clan, being the infamous clan they had been, did not
          even bother looking back and moved forward with the newer and better
          vassal families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time passed, and the Vasa Family slowly disappeared... at least from
          the public eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          While actually, they had just secluded themselves in the dense
          mountains of the north.
        </p>
        <p>
          The family was suffering badly during this time; the lack of decent
          exorcists in their family was one of the major reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could have directly migrated to the area with normal humans and
          could have lived a somewhat good life, but they did not.
        </p>
        <p>
          If an exorcist family decides to assimilate completely in the normal
          human cities, that would mean forever sealing their abilities and
          powers and live as normal humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the greatest shame an exorcist clan or family could suffer
          from; they would be forever killing their exorcist background to the
          root by doing that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, the Vasa family refused to go down this way; the current
          patriarch was an average man at best, both in terms of abilities and
          management.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one in the exorcism community would be willing to live the small
          life of a normal human. This was how the world worked, no matter how
          it was...
        </p>
        <p>
          During this time, fortune finally shined on them as they gave birth to
          a talented daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had above-average potential and was hardworking; she cared for her
          family and desired for her family to once again regain their lost
          respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She should be older than me..." Oliver thought; at this moment, she
          was already some years older than him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon seeing her family's dire circumstances, she decided to do the
          ultimate.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without the notice of her parents, she secretly picked up some
          valuables from her family's treasure vault. There were not many
          things, but she took what she considered to be sellable.
        </p>
        <p>
          A reckless and stupid move, but she did it out of desperation; she was
          not able to see her parents suffering every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          She hated this; what was the use of treasures or heirlooms if they
          can't be used when needed? If they can't be used and were only serving
          as decorations, then it was better to earn something from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The readers empathized with her decision to sell the artifacts seeing
          as it was an action out of love for her family and her desire to
          improve their situation, rather than a selfish or malicious act.
        </p>
        <p>
          She traveled all the way from her home to the Mystic Purge Clan and
          put the items up for auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was naive and had little knowledge of the world; she used her
          textbook knowledge and put the items up for auction in hopes of
          gaining funds that she could use to rebuild her family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe this was why she was scammed multiple times after leaving the
          mountains; she truly acted like an oblivious and ignorant bumpkin.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered how his actions would affect the future since he had
          directly purchased the heirloom of the Vasa family.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't know if she was even aware that the stone she had put up for
          auction was so important or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She didn't just think it was some ordinary item, right?" He doubted.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Stone of Sight], although appearing lacking and useless, was not.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was just because this artifact had certain conditions that needed
          to be fulfilled first before it could grant the bearer [Future Sight].
        </p>
        <p>
          The only reason people never realized its true potential was because
          the first and foremost condition to activate this artifact was through
          a sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>A sacrifice of one's own sight to achieve the first condition.</p>
        <p>
          The artifact worked on simple reasons; for someone to be able to bear
          the powers of [Future Sight], they must be prepared to vassal that
          power inside their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the best way to achieve that was to have a blank slate prepared;
          if used on a person with no sight, the chances for them to gain
          [Future Sight] increase highly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, it was very difficult to handle the power of [Future
          Sight].
        </p>
        <p>
          In the novel, it was mentioned briefly that someone had purchased the
          artifact from the auction, and later the daughter of the Vasa family
          had to go through many things and situations before being able to
          retrieve the artifact back.
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head...</p>
        <p>It was time for the last item!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 53: The last item. A demon!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 53</p>
        <p>
          In the end, he had purchased the [Stone of Sight], and it was not for
          no reason either.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not that he wanted to interfere in the plot and get involved
          with the high priestess of the Vasa family or anything like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's just that he was more or less interested in obtaining [Future
          Sight] for himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, he had no intentions to sacrifice his sight to gain that or
          anything.
        </p>
        <p>He had better ways to go around it.</p>
        <p>
          It was said that the vessel for [Future Sight] must have blank eyes to
          be able to adjust to the powers and divinity it brought along.
        </p>
        <p>
          But did he have to fear being unable to bear the load of [Future
          Sight] on him?
        </p>
        <p>Definitely not!</p>
        <p>
          He was someone with an evolved and upgraded version of one of the
          special eyes, the [Abyss Eyes], so it was a given that he could easily
          handle the load of such power himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Cosmic Void Gaze] was an unfathomable power, and something like
          [Future Sight] was very small in front of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could easily assimilate the power to see the future into his eyes
          to some extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he was quite sure that the effects he would have after that
          would be significantly reduced. He wouldn't be able to predict the
          future as accurately as a person with the complete version of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that was totally fine. He just wanted to add one more card or
          weapon in his arsenal. No matter how insignificant the effects of
          [Future Sight] might become, it would be better than having nothing at
          all!
        </p>

        <p>
          Not to mention, that he felt that he could also satisfy the other
          conditions as well.
        </p>
        <p>He calmly waited for the auction to be over.</p>
        <p>
          It was time for the final item of the auction, and his anticipations
          were quite high considering they were usually the best of the items.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then, moving onto the final item for this auction..." The
          auctioneer's voice was filled with excitement as two men brought a
          huge thing covered with a white cloth onto the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The audience also held their breath; it was definitely worth looking
          at...
        </p>
        <p>
          "Take off the covers! Let the audience feast their eyes on this item!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Multiple gasps and exclamations were heard as the cover was taken off.
        </p>
        <p>"What!?"</p>
        <p>"A demon!"</p>
        <p>"They have gotten an impressive find!"</p>
        <p>"Fuck! Didn't expect this demon to be here!"</p>
        <p>
          "You're seeing it right! It's a demon! A rare Michi, to be specific.
          It's an extremely rare demon and was very hard to subdue alive. As
          exorcists, you all must be familiar with this demon, so I will not say
          much. We all know how precious this is."
        </p>
        <p>
          The auctioneer stated as a tense atmosphere gripped the crowd; it was
          an extremely precious thing and most present knew its worth.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the problem was that this demon was going to be sold very high,
          and most probably all the VIPs on the second floor were going to
          fiercely bid for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people on the ground floor could only listen at this moment;
          interfering now would be useless and offensive.
        </p>

        <p>
          None of them wanted to offend the strong individuals above for this.
        </p>
        <p>"The bidding will start at 50 million Neden."</p>
        <p>"60 million."</p>
        <p>"80 million."</p>
        <p>"120 million."</p>
        <p>"150 million..."</p>
        <p>
          Terrifying amounts were raised without batting an eye by the VIPs
          present; they all knew what this demon was worth and wanted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sat on his chair and looked at the demonic creature closely,
          observing its features with interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creature was taller than a lamppost and moved crouched and close
          to the ground. Its blistery skin looked melted onto its swollen
          muscles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its body appeared to be covered in a foul-smelling liquid. It had 2
          arms that were too long for its body and ended in hook-like teal
          talons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two grotesque arms sprouted from its back like wings. Its face was
          bloated and bulbous. Its mouth gaped open with rows of saw-like teeth
          and a long black tongue. It had a single ooze-secreting white dot for
          an eye.
        </p>
        <p>'A Michi...'</p>
        <p>
          He knew of this demon from the novel; the reason the exorcists were so
          excited to see this demon was due to its special qualities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon possessed a poison brain. There were 17 different pathways
          inside the demon's brains which could be used to extract and make 17
          types of terrifying poisons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Capturing a Michi was very difficult as they usually lived in harsh
          environments and would rather die than be captured. That's why a
          living Michi was a rarity.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was feeling a sense of awe; he had never seen a fantasy creature
          before. All he was familiar with was a lazy and fat cat at home so
          far.
        </p>
        <p>
          So seeing a demon for the first time in his life left him impressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          His lips curled into a small smile; he has always read about demons in
          the novel and heard about their grotesque appearances and terrifying
          powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the demon's appearance, he did indeed was feeling disgusted
          as a human.
        </p>
        <p>'Wait, I won't be termed a racist, right?'</p>
        <p>
          He felt it was possible that he could be called a racist by the demon
          heretics or followers in the human territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, they would need to come out of hiding to call him that first.
        </p>
        <p>He heard the bidding was becoming heated as seconds passed by.</p>
        <p>
          Looking at the people above spitting such great amounts, he felt the
          urge to flaunt a little as well.
        </p>
        <p>Throughout the auction, he had been feeling quite poor.</p>
        <p>"180 million."</p>
        <p>Taking a small gap, he quickly uttered an amount as well.</p>
        <p>"200 million."</p>
        <p>
          To poke some fun, he directly bid 200 million Neden knowing that they
          would not stop at that only and bid more.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quite the risky joke, if it went wrong, he would forever be in
          debt! Only because he felt it was funny and safe did he place the
          bet...
        </p>
        <p>
          However, to his shock, there was silence after he spoke which made his
          hair stood on end.
        </p>
        <p>'No way, they will bid more, right?'</p>
        <p>
          He looked around and saw many people looking at him with strange
          expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          'What the fuck!? Was that a big amount to these people? They're going
          to bid more, right?'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver heard the auctioneer suddenly announce.</p>
        <p>"200 million Neden, is no one willing to bid higher?"</p>

        <h2>Chapter 54: Being followed?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 54</p>
        <p>
          'What the fuck!? Was that a big amount to these people? They're going
          to bid more, right?'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver heard the auctioneer suddenly announce.</p>
        <p>"200 million Neden, is no one willing to bid higher?"</p>
        <p>
          His heart sank when he heard that; he couldn't afford that at all nor
          did he intend to buy that ugly demon.
        </p>
        <p>"220 million."</p>
        <p>
          Fortunately for him, the bidding resumed as he heaved a sigh of relief
          and almost slumped back into the plump cushion of his chair.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, 200 million was indeed not too big of an amount for the
          people above; they all belonged to wealthy backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason that there was silence in the hall was due to the fact that
          someone like him who appeared to be nothing more than an
          attention-grabbing stupid brat dared to bid such an amount casually.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, him directly provoking the people on the floor above
          was also very brave of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people could not help but secretly admire the thick skin of
          brainless young masters!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure enough, the rich young masters didn't care about the future; they
          lived in the present and offended people left and right without giving
          face to their status.
        </p>
        <p>"Cough.."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver coughed awkwardly as he remained silent and didn't dare to joke
          around more.
        </p>
        <p>"240 million..."</p>
        <p>
          The bid had reached a great scale and now even the people on the
          second floor were hesitant to spend more, pondering if they should bid
          more or stop.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was at that moment when a cold feminine voice cut through every
          thought across the hall.
        </p>
        <p>"300 million Neden."</p>
        <p>
          A huge amount which directly extinguished any hesitance others had.
        </p>
        <p>Jenna Sullivan had placed her bid!</p>
        <p>
          The air was oppressive and no one dared to bid against her. They all
          were aware of how terrifying this woman was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being in the territory of Mystic Purge Clan, she operated
          without fear and was ruthless; she belonged to the Black Codex
          Federation.
        </p>
        <p>One of the executives of that giant superpower!</p>
        <p>It was not their place to even dream to compete with her.</p>
        <p>
          They knew that unless you were someone from an equal background to her
          or greater, you practically had no chance to win against her in terms
          of money.
        </p>
        <p>
          And many people were aware that she was a narrow-minded woman and
          would attack them in other ways if they offended her in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was better to not mess with her and get on bad terms with the Black
          Codex Federation for this demon.
        </p>
        <p>In a way, she was very similar to Oliver.</p>
        <p>The auctioneer saw this and directly announced.</p>
        <p>"The item now belongs to number 37! Congratulations!"</p>
        <p>
          "With this, the auction also ends. Buyers can collect their purchased
          items from behind the hallway. The servants will be attending to your
          needs and all transactions will take place there. Thank you for
          attending the auction!"
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, the auctioneer left and the men also took the caged demon
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Congratulations, sir, for your purchase. Please come this way... we
          will proceed with the transactions here. Your item is in this
          package."
        </p>
        <p>
          A polite man said to Oliver as he handed him a small glass box with
          the stone in it.
        </p>

        <p>"Alright, lead the way."</p>
        <p>
          He told the man as he looked around to see many of the guests
          inspecting their items and making payments to the staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had already checked using [Cosmic Void Gaze] and verified it was
          the real thing that the man had given him.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, he was still in his mask and cap.</p>
        <p>
          "Oh! Miss Sullivan, I am honored to be graced by your presence today!"
        </p>
        <p>
          A fat woman in a sparkling red dress said aloud, not caring about
          surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>Behind her were three exorcists serving as guards as well.</p>
        <p>
          It was evident that she was probably the manager of today's event and
          has personally come to deliver items Jenna had purchased to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna was a superior person unlike the ordinary him so it was normal
          for her to be received by high-profiled people as well.
        </p>
        <p>"Don't waste my time. Hurry up and bring the items."</p>
        <p>
          Jenna replied in a tone colder than ice, making the surrounding people
          gasp.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fat woman in the red dress could not help but pop a vein on her
          forehead in anger, but she still maintained a professional strained
          smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As you wish, they will be here shortly, well, if you'll excuse me."
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman in red quickly left before suffering any further insult. She
          could not argue with Jenna; she was not in a position to in the first
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna's status and power were way above hers, so she could only bear
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver who was far and heard it could not help but exclaim secretly at
          her unfriendliness and lack of IQ.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this sort of attitude, he could only imagine the number of people
          she must have offended in the past.
        </p>

        <p>No wonder, she was so cold!</p>
        <p>She must have no friends!</p>
        <p>
          Jenna, who was impatient, felt his gaze and turned her head to look at
          him. She felt he was again looking at her pitifully, which she didn't
          like at all for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          She frowned and ignored him; she had made it clear that she did not
          want to be related to him in the public or it'll bring annoyances her
          way considering his special status.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear she wanted her relationship with him to be strictly
          professional.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver saw this and did not look at her again.</p>
        <p>
          He took out the black card and handed it to the polite staff to make
          the transaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man looked at the golden 'C' engraved on the card and could not
          help but feel surprised.
        </p>
        <p>Someone else from the Black Codex Federation?</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, he quickly did the payment and escorted him out.</p>
        <p>_________________</p>
        <p>After coming out of the auction, he heaved a breath of relief.</p>
        <p>
          Fortunately, he did not encounter troublesome things at the auction,
          and everything went smoothly.
        </p>
        <p>"I should get going now..."</p>
        <p>
          He walked towards the exit of the market but in the middle of his way,
          he suddenly turned around.
        </p>
        <p>He moved in random directions and stopped.</p>
        <p>'I am being followed? Who is it?'</p>
        <p>
          He wondered; he could sense the other party tailing behind him trying
          to be discrete, but he was able to catch their movements.
        </p>
        <p>It indicated one thing!</p>
        <p>
          They were novices and didn't know that he had already sensed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaking his head, he decided to confront the person directly; he
          didn't want someone to follow him back to his courtyard and bother him
          at night.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quietly led his follower towards a desolate and silent area,
          somewhat far away from the bustling marketplace.
        </p>
        <p>Suddenly he turned backward and rushed to the person in cloak!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 55: Lucia Vasa!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 55</p>
        <p>
          He turned around abruptly and, making use of his high speed, went
          directly towards a distant figure who was most likely following
          himâcatching the latter off guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing him in high speed, the person in the cloak was shocked and
          quickly tried to flee, only to be tackled to the ground by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver got straight to the point; grabbing the throat of the cloaked
          person, he asked with cold eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Who are you?" His voice was sharp and low.</p>
        <p>"Why were you following me?"</p>
        <p>
          He tightened his grip as the figure tried to shake off his hand and
          escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          He threatened, "If you move too much, I'll directly crush your neck
          and kill you. Answer my questions and I'll let you live. Who ordered
          you to follow me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The flailing figure stopped moving around when his words were heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing this, Oliver lessened his grip. Naturally, he had no intention
          to kill; he had never killed an animal, let alone a human before.
        </p>
        <p>It would be weird if he suddenly became a cold-blooded killer.</p>
        <p>
          He just threatened the person to make them stop; in this world, such
          killings were common, so a smart person would know when to surrender.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said, "Let's take off your hood; I would like to see your face."
        </p>
        <p>
          He used his other hand and directly removed the hood covering the
          person's head.
        </p>

        <p>
          Wavy and shiny crystal blue hair emerged from underneath the hood...
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes slowly widened behind his mask as he saw the face of the
          woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Ding! Lucia Vasa. Does the host wish to bind with the individual?]
        </p>
        <p>'Lucia Vasa! What is she doing here!?"</p>
        <p>
          He was quite surprised seeing one of the major characters of the novel
          right in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>He swiftly declined the system and looked back at her.</p>
        <p>
          She had ink-blue colored eyes which were strained at the moment and
          glaring at him; she had a small button nose and glossy pink lips, her
          skin was fair and devoid of blemishes.
        </p>
        <p>She said in a low voice, "Let me down. I'll talk."</p>
        <p>
          Hearing this, he came back to his senses and calmly released his grip
          on her throat. He knew she must have something to say to him if she
          followed him for so long.
        </p>
        <p>Also, he did not feel good holding someone by their throat...</p>
        <p>"Speak," he said.</p>
        <p>
          He did not waver much and maintained a stoic persona while internally
          he was wondering if he should reveal himself or not.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, he decided not to do so...</p>
        <p>
          He was curious about her reason; why was she here and what was she
          doing here?
        </p>
        <p>
          He could understand that she was probably here for the auction to sell
          the things.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I-uhm, I am Lucia Vasa... Actually, the stone that you purchased,
          well, I am the one who put that on auction..."
        </p>
        <p>
          She said, her tone faltering slightly, displaying her lack of
          confidence and hesitance.
        </p>
        <p>"So what?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver questioned; so what if she was the seller? He had purchased the
          artifact now and was the official owner of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention, the auction house strictly forbade its sellers to
          directly approach its clients and demand things back.
        </p>
        <p>
          This action of hers could give her a permanent ban from the auction
          circle for a lifetimeâwith her merchant status getting revoked as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          She continued, "I am sorry, this may sound ridiculous and unrelated to
          you, but please listen to me for a moment. I know I am being a bother
          right now, but this is very important to me that I let you know of
          this."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver calmly asked,</p>
        <p>"What is it?"</p>
        <p>
          Seeing that he was not leaving or attacking her again, Lucia was
          relieved; she told him,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Actually, the stone you are currently taking with you is the family
          heirloom of the Vasa Family, an exorcist family in seclusion. I am not
          sure if you have ever heard of our name, but my family was very
          prominent some decades ago."
        </p>
        <p>
          She paused before continuing, "But at the moment, although I feel
          ashamed to admit it, we have fallen and are now suffering to maintain
          our long-existing family. It has become a tenth of what it once used
          to be... the stone in your hands, I don't know why, but it's the
          heirloom that has been passed in my family from generation to
          generation..."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes turned somewhat desperate and moist; clenching her fist, she
          lowered her head.
        </p>
        <p>"I beg of you... could you please return this to me."</p>
        <p>
          Her body trembled slightly, displaying how difficult it must have been
          for a heiress to bow down to someone and beg for something.
        </p>

        <p>"Unfortunately, that cannot happenâ"</p>
        <p>
          "Please! I beg of you, please! I am willing to put anything on line in
          exchange for it." She cut him and pleaded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then why did you even put it up on the auction in the first place if
          you had never intended to sell it?"
        </p>
        <p>He paused and asked something first.</p>
        <p>"That... It's a complex story."</p>
        <p>
          She narrated the story of how she came from the mountains and how the
          thing and auction happened to now.
        </p>
        <p>
          So basically, to summarize, her father had realized that she had
          stolen artifacts from the household and was enraged and regretful.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not just come to the Mystic Purge Clan suddenly now, and it
          would take him a considerable amount of time to even reach them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, he used his connections and delivered her a message through which
          she came to know that the stone she had thought was useless and
          ordinary was actually her family heirloom.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, she was shocked, but she trusted her father and asked the
          auction staff to give the stone back; however, by then it was already
          too late.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt that no one would buy that stone considering its lacking look
          and uses; she had just picked it up at random from the treasure vault
          while leaving her house.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even she felt that the stone would not sell, but when she heard from
          her father that it was actually their family inheritance, she was
          shocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stone was definitely not ordinary and was directly tied to the
          secret of the past when her ancestors were great exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          She regretted ever auctioning the stone; at the same time, she was
          quite in awe that Oliver was keen enough to see through the special
          stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why were you following me secretly like this then? Why didn't you
          directly approach me?" He could not help but be curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That... it's because of your suspicious get-up. You are dressed like
          a kidnapper... so..."
        </p>
        <p>She spoke in a somewhat straight tone, leaving Oliver speechless.</p>
        <p>Come to think of it, he was indeed dressed suspicious.</p>
        <p>A black summer cap, a mask covering full face...</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head of such thoughts and looked at her oblivious face.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Sigh, why is she so naive...? Had she told this to a villain
          character, then it would have remained a dream to even get the
          artifact back.'
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 56: She got scammed?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 56</p>
        <p>
          'Sigh, why is she so naive...? Had she told this to a villain
          character, then it would have remained a dream to even get the
          artifact back.'
        </p>
        <p>
          She was recklessly following him thinking he wouldn't notice, but he
          was smart and knew the person tailing him was a novice, and only then
          did he dare to attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, she seemed quite clueless at the moment. It might be due to
          the fact that she had come from the mountains and was still learning
          about the world. In the novel, she had later become a more intelligent
          person than she was now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing that the masked person was silent, Lucia felt anxious that he
          was not going to give it back to her. She would never be able to face
          her father again if she lost this...
        </p>
        <p>"Unfortunately, Iâ"</p>
        <p>"PLEASE! Please reconsider it!"</p>
        <p>
          She bowed even deeper, clasping her hands together and looking at him.
        </p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>
          "Could you stop cutting me off? I will just leave if you keep doing
          that," he said annoyedly.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh... yes, please say."</p>
        <p>
          "What I was saying was that I cannot give this artifact to you now."
        </p>
        <p>
          Lucia felt depressed when she heard this, but her ears perked up
          slightly when she heard the word 'now'.
        </p>
        <p>Confusedly, she glanced at him.</p>

        <p>
          "You heard that right, I cannot give this to you now, but I can give
          it to you in the future when I am done with using it."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh..."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her and nodded internally. It was better to be in
          contact with her in the future. He might be able to have a positive
          relationship with the main protagonist in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But what do you need this stone for? Do you know about it?" Lucia
          asked curiously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even she did not know what this stone was used for. She had only heard
          her father emphasize its importance in the message. Never had she
          heard from him about it or its uses.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, now that someone seemed to know about the stone artifact, she
          naturally wanted to know.
        </p>
        <p>"It's... nothing."</p>
        <p>
          He was about to say something but paused. She should come to know
          about this herself. If he told her about this, then it would only
          unnecessarily complicate matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How could it be nothing? You were just about to tell something...?
          What is it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The blue-haired girl asked with an expression of intensity. She felt
          that he clearly knew what the artifact was and its uses but decided
          not to inform her. It made her feel more interested to know what her
          family heirloom did exactly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You will know in due time; ask your father about it, he will explain
          it to you better."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver calmly said, which made her eyes widen.</p>
        <p>"You know my father!?"</p>
        <p>
          She could not believe that the person who had purchased the stone even
          knew her father.
        </p>
        <p>This made her feel Oliver was definitely not a simple person.</p>

        <p>
          While their family has fallen now, her father still considered himself
          a proud exorcist and had a very limited circle. The people he was in
          contact with were also not simple, so she was inclined to believe that
          Oliver was also not ordinary.
        </p>
        <p>
          This somehow made her trust him more. Earlier, she was feeling uneasy
          that he might leave with her artifact and never return it, but now she
          felt that he might return it to her in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he knew about the artifact that was her family's heirloom, then it
          must mean he was close to either her father and mother, or else it was
          almost impossible to know such a deep secret about her family.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can think of it that way. Anyways, you ask your father later," he
          told her.
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought for a moment as he stared at her deep eyes before saying,
          "I'll return this stone to you in a few years. You don't need to worry
          about how and why. And erm... if I am not wrong, you'll be attending
          the academy at that time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Lucia was simply unable to speak anything at the moment. This person
          in the mask seems to have made a deep and long plan already. He even
          told her that she would be attending the academy at the time he'll
          return the stone back.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had planned to enroll in the academy indeed, but this news was
          something she had only discussed with a few people in her family. So
          for him to know that she'll be going to the academy made her feel
          weird. Not to mention, she was not even sure that she would be
          accepted into the institute of such talented exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uhm, Sir... if I may, what's your name? You seem to know my family
          deeply."
        </p>
        <p>
          She bent her neck a little and asked hesitantly. She felt that it was
          proper to address this person as sir; he was clearly a superior
          exorcist with great power.
        </p>
        <p>She could not sense even a hint of espera from him!</p>
        <p>
          "You don't need to know. I'll be taking my leave if that's all.
          Remember to train hard; the times about to come will be difficult but
          you must persist."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver refrained from sharing anything with her at the moment. He
          encouraged her slightly to train harder so she could grow stronger
          faster and make the world peaceful with the protagonist quickly for
          him to live.
        </p>
        <p>"...Ah."</p>
        <p>
          Lucia seemed to want to say something more, but the words could not
          come out of her mouth. She felt a heated feeling in her heart; an
          expert exorcist actually gave her encouragement personally?
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the same feeling she felt whenever her father personally
          supervised her training.
        </p>

        <p>
          She felt motivated and energized. If possible, in the future, she
          would definitely like to know who it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was a bit disappointed that she was not able to get his name
          considering she was thinking about asking her father about him later.
        </p>
        <p>
          She took a deep breath and went her own way to look for opportunities
          to grow stronger and reply to her father's message about the current
          situation with the mysterious man.
        </p>
        <p>
          She returned back and contacted her father and told him about the
          details.
        </p>

          even knew she will be enrolling in the academy in the future??"
        </p>
        <p>"???"</p>
        <p>
          Lucia's father received the message from her daughter about the
          situation and was stunned!
        </p>
        <p>"She even said that he was a close friend of mine??"</p>
        <p>What's going on?</p>
        <p>
          Why did he not remember anyone with a mask and cap on his friend list?

        <p>Was this friendship supposed to be one-sided?</p>
        <p>"FUCK! She did not get scammed, right?"</p>

          sunken...

          Her daughter had finally done the unthinkable. She had always been an

          had was placed on the [Stone of Sight]. It was supposed to be used to
          awaken Lucia's bloodline, and now it's gone..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "D-Didn't she say that she was confident that the stranger will return
          the artifact back in a few years? If so, then there's stillâ"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you crazy? Do you actually believe that? Lucia is naive and
          unreliable when it comes to such matters. She's only good when it
          comes to talent; her social skills are limited just like her knowledge
          about the world..."
        </p>
        <p>The father reprimanded the mother.</p>
        <p>
          Hearing this, she fell silent. His words did seem to make sense after
          all.
        </p>

        <p>No matter how supportive she was, she knew her daughter well.</p>
        <p>He slowly got up, supporting himself with the help of his wife.</p>
        <p>"Where are you going now?"</p>
        <p>
          "I cannot trust Lucia... I need to go and find the artifact myself...
          or at least find a solution to this mess, or else we are completely
          doomed," he said in a resolute tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you even going to do?" Lucia's mother could not help but ask
          uncertainly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll try to see if I can find the stranger first by asking around
          first... if push comes to shove, I still have some connections with
          the Mystic Purge Clan..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Clan! You think they will help us? They had long moved forward.
          You'll only be making a fool of yourself among those high-class noble
          exorcists. We both know they detest low-class powerless exorcists like
          us."
        </p>
        <p>She could not help but warn worriedly.</p>
        <p>
          "I know, but I must do something or I'll never be able to live
          properly..." He said with eyes closed as he recalled some memories of
          the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking a deep breath, he told his wife, "I'll be leaving for the
          central area. I need to teach Lucia a lesson as well."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, he left the room in a hurry, leaving behind a worried
          woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Oh, Lucia, my child. What have you done... causing so much trouble to
          your father... I hope he won't be too harsh on her.'
        </p>
        <p>It was clear that her father was a paranoid person.</p>

        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>"Zippy, I am back!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver announced as usual and received a lazy 'meow' in response back.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cat was laying in the courtyard on its back with its bloating
          belly upwards.
        </p>
        <p>She had just eaten and was now laying around in laziness.</p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>
          His lips could not help but twitch at the useless cat. Her antics were
          very undignified for a reputed clan guardian.
        </p>
        <p>He directly ignored the cat and went inside.</p>
        <p>
          He placed the [Stone of Sight] in a secure box and rested by the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I have now acquired the artifact; now I need two more things before I
          can awaken [Future Sight]...'
        </p>
        <p>He thought in a composed state.</p>
        <p>
          'The first condition for this stated that the individual must
          sacrifice their sight in order to become a vessel capable enough to
          handle its power.'
        </p>
        <p>But naturally, he was not interested in doing that.</p>

        <p>
          With [Cosmic Void Gaze], he could easily bypass this condition. He was
          already a strong enough vessel.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be more or less like adding an attribute of [Future Sight] to
          the [Cosmic Void Gaze].
        </p>
        <p>'The second one is the difficult one to achieve at the moment.'</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the rapier laying by his side and lightly brushed it with
          his fingers as he remembered the second condition Lucia had to undergo
          in order to awaken her latent potential.
        </p>
        <p>'The Trial of Oracle.'</p>
        <p>
          'It was a trial that one must undergo if they wished to use the [Stone
          of Sight] at any cost. It was a trial that was there conducted by the
          mysterious being Oracle in order to find people worthy to inherit the
          powers. Anyone succeeding in the trial would directly become a
          Prophetic Kin.'
        </p>
        <p>'But...'</p>
        <p>
          'The trial was held in the Mountains of Mist which was a place located
          quite far from the Mystic Purge Clan. Not to mention, the coordinates
          of the place where the trial was supposed to be were hard to locate.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'It was more or less like a test as soon as one stepped foot in the
          mountains; after all, a seer must be able to see all paths and find
          the correct one out of the many misleading ones.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'If I succeed in clearing the trial, I could awaken the bloodline that
          Lucia was able to obtain as well.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He pressed onto the rapier as he thought about it. He could not use
          Lucia as a medium to obtain tenfold benefits this time. First of all,
          he was already tied to Nadia at the moment and had no plans to switch
          targets. He didn't know when Lucia was going to awaken the
          bloodlineâit would probably be quite late in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't have the patience to wait that long. By then, he might have
          already met with the main protagonist of the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, Lucia had little training benefits to offer as compared
          to Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia, being the rich miss of the clan, had countless resources at her
          disposal so her growth rate was faster than Lucia's, who belonged to a
          poor family with little resources to spare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, that she was now on her own training by herself, which
          would slow her down even more. It was not worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The Vasa Family seems to believe that it was their latent bloodline
          that was awakened by the [Stone of Sight] while in fact it was not
          entirely the case. Their ancestor was able to clear the trial of
          Oracle and was thus able to obtain the famed bloodline called
          [Tomorrow's Path]...'
        </p>
        <p>
          'However, since he married a weak woman afterwards, his children were
          not able to inherit the powerful blood in his veins... the [Stone of
          Sight] was something like a key that he had managed to obtain from the
          place where the trial was held.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'The artifact was a sort of key that helped the bearer bypass some
          difficult stages and advance. It was not clearly mentioned but only in
          brief... Lucia's grandfather was the last person who knew of these
          things but unfortunately he died in the battlefield not able to
          clearly teach his son about this stuff.'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver could not help but shake his head when he realized this.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 58: Preparations for the Demon Hunt!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 58</p>
        <p>
          'But well, whatever it may be, fate or destiny, Lucia was able to
          somehow find the place of trial and through a series of fights with
          her other companions, she cleared the Oracle's trial and was thus
          rewarded with the awakening of [Tomorrow's Path] bloodline!'
        </p>
        <p>"Haha... what a plot!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but clap lightly; this was very much fate or
          destiny for Lucia.
        </p>
        <p>He wanted to obtain the bloodline as well!</p>
        <p>
          [Tomorrow's Path] was a powerful bloodline revolving around Oracle and
          Fate. He would be stupid to let this opportunity fly past him.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I will need to leave the clan... I need this bloodline before going
          to the academy...'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver thought with a serious look in his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          He felt it was better to train on his own. According to his
          calculations, he wouldn't be able to grow much if he remained in the
          clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          His treatment in the clan was not the best, and giving treasures to
          Nadia was becoming difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would not accept it and would strongly insist against him meeting
          her. With the way things were, it would be quite difficult for him to
          remain in much contact with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not naive either; he could not trick her into using the
          treasures and artifacts to grow, as he had hoped.
        </p>
        <p>
          He realized that he had very little control in this situation; people
          were not as easy as depicted in the novels he was used to reading.
        </p>

        <p>
          He realized this, fortunately, and now he must plan his growth
          accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Staying in the clan was not optimal; sure, Nadia could grow powerful
          over time, and so would he, but then what would be the use of him
          reincarnating in this fantasy world?
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to explore the world himself as well, see the various
          mystical things; if he waited until he got strong, then it would be a
          big waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          There would always be someone stronger than him, so did that mean he
          needed to wait until he became the strongest? How much time would that
          take? Some centuries? He was a normal human and did not have that
          level of patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could never spend centuries doing the same thing and following a
          single routine every day; he would die of boredom.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not understand how the novel protagonists would suddenly
          become like ascetic monks after experiencing reincarnation. Being able
          to spend a thousand years in some random cave or being a janitor in
          some sect only to come out when enemies invaded?
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe they were indeed extraordinary, but he sure was not, and nor did
          he intend to spend the majority of his life in one place.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, it was something he must do sooner or later.</p>
        <p>
          For now, it was impossible to leave the clan; the demon hunt was
          coming up, and there was no way he could sneak out.
        </p>
        <p>'Maybe I should ask for Jenna's help?'</p>
        <p>He felt she might be able to help him somehow leave the clan.</p>
        <p>'Or should I let the clan guardian help me with this one...?'</p>
        <p>
          He thought of the pristine white cat and felt she could take him out
          very easily.
        </p>
        <p>'Or I could try to sneak out myself.'</p>
        <p>
          For now, he put his thoughts to rest. There was nothing much he could
          do in this for now. He should be focusing on growing stronger first.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was not even sure if leaving the clan relying on his own was even
          possible and not to mention that after the demon hunt, how would the
          clan react?
        </p>
        <p>
          Would his treatment be better than before? Would he still need to
          leave the clan at that time?
        </p>
        <p>Would there be schemes involved revolving around him?</p>
        <p>He must wait patiently.</p>
        <p>
          The demon hunt was an important event, not from the novel's
          perspective but from his clan's perspective.
        </p>
        <p>
          Basically, the contents were always different, but the main crux was
          that the heirs would be thrown between demons and would be asked to
          hunt them. The stronger the demon they were able to hunt down and
          bring back, the greater the chance of victory in the event!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver got up and clutched the rapier in his hand; he was going to
          train now.
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>
          Just like that, days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into
          months...
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver barely interacted with Nadia during this time; he had grown
          numb to her cold attitude by now.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would not even look at him if by chance they ever met face to
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he tried not to mind her behavior and kept trying from
          time to time to tempt her with artifacts and elixirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to say she had a strong mental fortitude for a 6-year-old...
        </p>
        <p>
          He doubted that exorcists outside would ever refuse a free elixir or
          artifact; well, they would even try to kill him to get it and here she
          was.
        </p>
        <p>
          He received some occasional strength boosts from her during the
          following months. And his body status was now something like this:
        </p>

        <p><strong>_______________</strong></p>
        <p>[Name: Oliver Mystic]</p>
        <p>[Race: Human]</p>
        <p>[Strength: Level 4]</p>
        <p>[Espera: Level 1]</p>
        <p>[Charisma: Level 3]</p>
        <p>[Luck: Level 2]</p>
        <p><strong>_______________</strong></p>
        <p>
          "The demon Hunt will begin in a week..." Oliver muttered as he wiped
          off his sweat after an intense training session.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the good span of many months, he did not dare to slack at all; he
          received tenfold strength boosts during these months and thus trained
          as a physical exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          He decided to specialize so that he would not be lacking compared to
          others of a sane level in strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he did not get any techniques other than [Sovereign Strike of
          Infinite Freedom] from Nadia, he paid that no heed and instead
          searched for new weapon techniques himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The market was huge, and there were all sorts of mysterious sellers;
          it was hard to find good techniques, but he was persistent and was
          thus able to get some good stuff.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's only a week before I will be in the presence of the elders and
          the other heirs; I must prepare myself for this mentally as well."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the various equipment laying around him: a rapier, a
          spear, a dagger, and an axe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he was someone from the modern world, and he knew just how
          useful versatility could be when it came to mastering weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would naturally not limit himself to one or two weapons; mastering
          more weapons was better for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, if he bound himself to another target specializing in
          another weapon, style, and art, he would have difficulties adapting if
          he was already not accustomed.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 59: Children from Vassal Families! Being talked about!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 59</p>
        <p>
          In the future, if he bound himself to another target specializing in
          another weapon, style, and art, he would have difficulties adapting to
          that if he were not already accustomed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, it was important for him to learn these things himself and put
          some effort as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          He must utilize the system to the best of its capabilities rather than
          just waiting for the rewards all the time.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would become a useless person if he did that, which no one wanted.
        </p>
        <p>Plus, it would be too boring for him.</p>
        <p>
          The system only allocated the rewards when it was deemed so by the
          system's standards. And waiting for that would be quite risky, so he
          had no other choice but to train hard like everyone else did.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this, he wouldn't feel bad in the future either; he was like
          that; if he kept receiving rewards with no effort, he would feel a
          lack of confidence when facing those who had put in efforts for the
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made sure to train harder than others for the great power he gains.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The demon hunt is on the edge now; I can only wait to see what will
          happen there..."
        </p>
        <p>
          He had some concerns, from his sudden participation to the schemes the
          higher-ups have been cooking and how he might get dragged into
          unnecessary conflicts and troubles.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only wait and see what would happen on the site of the trial
          itself instead of overthinking.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was time for others to know about him... the clan was going to know
          about the hidden existence that they have all ignored so far...
        </p>

        <p>It was time...</p>
        <p>_______________________</p>
        <p>In the central area of the clan</p>
        <p>
          A group of people were gathered in a place some distance away from the
          residential area.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most noticeable feature in the group was the presence of many
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were the children of the Mystic Purge Clan, specifically from the
          direct lineage of the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were a total of 20 children, 8 from the main family and the rest
          from the vassal families.
        </p>
        <p>What were the children from vassal families doing in there?</p>
        <p>
          It was an opportunity; a great opportunity for them to make their
          families climb higher in the hierarchy and maintain a closer bond with
          the main heirs of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, it was witnessed that the rewards for the event were
          always very extravagant and mouth-watering.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even experts and veterans would crave such rewards in the outside
          world that were being spent on growing children.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mystic Purge Clan rewarded generously to those who had strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver reached the venue promptly, and no sooner did he reach, he
          received all sorts of stares from the present individuals.
        </p>
        <p>"Look over there, who's he?"</p>
        <p>A child from a vessel family asked his neighbor.</p>

        <p>"He has white hair... is he from the main lineage?"</p>
        <p>
          "But I never knew about him? My dad informed me about all the heirs
          and I thoroughly learned about them... if it was someone familiar, I
          would have recognized?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uhh, I cannot sense any espera from him too. He's not weak, is he?"
          Someone questioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know, from my sources, he's the isolated one. I think his name is
          Oliver. The clan has some rumors that he has no talent and was thus
          isolated to save shame on the clan's name."
        </p>
        <p>
          A somewhat taller kid said as he looked at others, his voice had a
          hint of contempt. Naturally, they all have been raised to value
          strength and power above everything else and would look down on the
          weak.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not seem to fear the consequences of belittling a main heir of
          the clan, knowing Oliver's meager status in the clan, he believed that
          no one would say anything to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The others who heard this were either shocked or seemed to be aware of
          it already.
        </p>
        <p>Immediately murmurs filled the group of children...</p>
        <p>
          "What a joke! To think there was someone like this in the main family
          of the clan."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Seriously, why are they even letting him live in the clan's estate?
          Kick him out already."
        </p>
        <p>
          "My parents would have disowned me had I been born without any
          talent!"
        </p>
        <p>"Fucking bastard, enjoying clan's resources while being useless."</p>
        <p>
          "Haha, even so, he has some guts to be able to participate in the
          demon hunt event! Does he not fear death or is he simply stupid enough
          to believe that he could have a chance here?" A kid couldn't help but
          be curious and ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another one sneered as he replied, "You've got it wrong. It's not that
          he doesn't fear death but it's due to the clan's age-old tradition
          that all main heirs must participate in this event."
        </p>
        <p>
          The murmurs kept getting heated about him; they simply did not care
          whether Oliver could hear them or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a rare opportunity that they got to trash talk about a main
          heir of the clan. It must be the first time ever that the children
          from the vassal families were bold enough to even speak ill of a main
          heir.
        </p>
        <p>It was chilling!</p>
        <p>
          Some still chose to remain silent and just observe the situation, and
          it was evident that the silent ones were the ones who were more
          influential and powerful than the ones chattering loudly.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver ignored them just like he ignored poop on the streets.</p>
        <p>
          He slowly distanced himself towards an alienated corner waiting for
          the elders to arrive.
        </p>
        <p>"Ha? Look at this. Who do we have here?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver paused as he heard a familiar voice behind him; his blood
          started to boil as he instantly recognized the cocky voice.
        </p>
        <p>It was the 3rd brother.</p>
        <p>The bastard who had beaten him last time.</p>
        <p>Oliver turned around and was now face-to-face against him.</p>
        <p>
          He calmed his nerves down; this was an opportunity that he had been
          waiting for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>This was the perfect place to get his revenge for last time.</p>
        <p>"What are you looking at?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked to the side where the feminine voice came from; it was
          the 3rd sister.
        </p>
        <p>Great, both of them were here.</p>
        <p>It would be easier to crush them together.</p>
        <p>"I asked, what are you looking at?"</p>
        <p>
          The 3rd sister directly grabbed his collar when she saw Oliver
          ignoring her presence.
        </p>
        <p>She felt as though she were being ignored by an ant.</p>
        <p>Oliver said nothing and just looked at her with cold eyes.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 60: Too weak! Calm before the storm</h2>
        <p>Chapter 60</p>
        <p>
          Seeing his stare and gaze, she was becoming more and more infuriated.
        </p>
        <p>"Was the lesson we taught you last time not good enough?"</p>
        <p>She pulled him closer and whispered slowly with a cruel smirk.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's hand trembled in anger as he had the urge to slap the cheek
          close to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He endured and did not lose his temper; going wild here was not the
          best considering the presence of so many witnesses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether he wants to accept it or not, these little bastards were
          supposed to be the elder siblings, and if he, a nobody acted wild
          against them, then not only will he face prejudice but also lose the
          advantage of hiding his powers from others so far.
        </p>
        <p>It was better to deal with them once the hunt started.</p>
        <p>
          Hearing no response from him, she felt that he was now scared of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Be grateful that we allowed you to live another day... know your
          place and never look us in the eye again in the future."
        </p>
        <p>
          She pushed him back with some considerable force, intending to make
          him fall on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to her surprise, he just stepped back as if he did not even feel
          her push.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in fact, this was indeed the case, he did not even feel her push
          because of the great disparity in their overall strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noticing that Oliver was still looking at her right in the eye as if
          her previous words meant nothing, a vein popped on her forehead.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver looked at her and said, "That's it? Too weak"</p>

        <p>
          He intentionally provoked her, letting the surrounding crowd hear
          them.
        </p>
        <p>"You-!"</p>
        <p>"Stop it, you're causing a scene."</p>
        <p>
          Shane put his hand on her shoulder and stopped her from acting any
          further than this.
        </p>
        <p>
          She might not be aware but she was just making a fool of herself in
          front of the children of the vessel family.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were expected to be above them always and now Oliver's clear lack
          of respect even after a warning was just making it worse for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he wanted, he could have let his sister teach him a lesson and make
          an example out of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it would only make them look barbaric and unreasonableâin the end,
          they might have lesser support than their other siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
          While they valued strength above everything, it did not mean they were
          barbarians, they were nobles who followed after strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shane, let me be. I will make an example out of this bastard
          today...!" She gritted her teeth in anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver simply looked at her in the eyes as if giving a provocation, he
          would not attack her but if she did then he would resist and fight
          back.
        </p>
        <p>He was prepared to do so.</p>
        <p>
          Shane looked at his sister and whispered, "There are many people here,
          plus the elders would be arriving anytime now. We can deal with him
          during the hunt."
        </p>
        <p>
          His words seemed to reason with her as she calmed down and looked at
          Oliver with a cruel glint in her eyes, she would make sure that he
          would become a cripple after the hunt for sure.
        </p>
        <p>With that, he took her away from the crowd.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver sneered, he wanted to see what would she do? Let the hunt start
          first, then he would deal with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver also diverted his mind, his mood was now bad because of this
          encounter, although he appeared calm, his hand was trembling slightly
          in anger, he really wanted to pounce on them and beat them ten times
          worse than they did to him.
        </p>

        <p>
          He looked around and instinctively activated [Cosmic Void Gaze] and
          felt the espera of the children around, determining any potential
          opponents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to this, he found that all the children present here had a decent
          level of espera for their age. It was understandable as the vessel
          families sent their best kids out for this event after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The age range was five to ten years old for this event and if he was
          not wrong he came in the youngest group.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was ridiculous to let children participate in such a terrifying
          game of hunting but this was not the world that could be understood by
          common sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the clan of the best exorcists around the world and likewise,
          the children must also be the best among the best.
        </p>
        <p>
          Intellect, strength, influence, everything must be controlled since a
          young age.
        </p>
        <p>"Haha..."</p>
        <p>
          He let out a laugh as he felt a great amount of espera radiating from
          some of the children, these were definitely the cream of the crop even
          among the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          He even spotted the second brother of his as well in the corner and
          found his espera had increased as compared to before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver suddenly felt his eyes narrow as he noticed a glowing lump of
          massive espera in the corner.
        </p>
        <p>Short white hair... emotionless expression...</p>
        <p>It was Nadia, she was also there.</p>
        <p>
          He deactivated the special eyes and walked towards her and found her
          standing alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other children did not dare to come too close to her and were
          maintaining a sort of invisible distance.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey?"</p>
        <p>He called out to her making her flinch slightly.</p>
        <p>She turned around, her expression as cold as it could get.</p>

        <p>
          And why not? She had warned him repeatedly to not even approach her.
          But this guy still dared to call out to her in this massive crowd. Was
          he stupid?
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at him as if looking at an insect and her gaze was
          terrifying.
        </p>
        <p>'Oh, fuck! She's so scary!'</p>
        <p>
          His heart almost skipped a beat due to the strong intensity of the
          gaze, he felt slight chills on his back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh my god! Look over there. This guy actually dared to call out to
          Miss Nadia."
        </p>
        <p>"He is done for. Is he really an idiot?"</p>
        <p>
          "Causally approaching Miss Naida, this idiot must be courting death
          for sure."
        </p>
        <p>The people around were shocked and whispered about this.</p>
        <p>"Even if he's the twin sibling... he's still being too bold."</p>
        <p>
          However, contrary to everyone's expectation of him getting beaten up,
          something else happened.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia did not do anything and simply walked away.</p>
        <p>This scene shocked the onlookers a lot.</p>
        <p>"Uh? Did Miss Nadia just walk away?"</p>
        <p>"That's it?"</p>
        <p>"What? I was expecting her to teach him his place."</p>
        <p>
          "You're all foolish, why would she beat someone just because they
          approached her?"
        </p>
        <p>A somewhat normal-brained girl asked which quickly shut them up.</p>
        <p>"...."</p>
        <p>"Right. Why would she...? Haha!"</p>
        <p>
          "O-Of course, why would she...? Only a brainless person would do
          something like that!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Another one said, not knowing that they were all expecting that to
          happen making them categorized as brainless.
        </p>
        <p>"She's too generous and let him go."</p>
