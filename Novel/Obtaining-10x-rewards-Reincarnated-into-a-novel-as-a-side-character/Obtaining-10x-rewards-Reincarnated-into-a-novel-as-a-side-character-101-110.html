        <h2>Chapter 101: The artifact did not work?</h2>
        <p>
          Alphonso had always been a person who did thorough research on both
          his allies and enemies beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter how strong he was compared to his peers, he had always
          remained vigilant.
        </p>
        <p>
          So naturally, he had researched the people he was going to meet today
          as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, gathering information on the heirs of five major clans was
          no joke. He had specifically asked his elders to obtain it for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had to spend a huge amount of resources to gain some brief
          insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          The people from the Celestial Paradox Clan had always been the
          strongest for generations, and the two girls were exceptional
          prodigies from the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel from the Sacred Swords Clan was a sword prodigy. The Sacred
          Swords Clan was famous for producing the strongest physical exorcists
          and tool masters. From his information, he knew that this guy was
          hot-headed.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why he did not talk with him from the beginning either. He
          was not used to interacting with such types of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, he also knew that although this guy seemed
          hot-tempered, he was actually quite clever and a sword prodigy at
          that.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Amber from the Blue Crown Clan was also quite
          talented and had a knack for talismans and other exorcism tools.
        </p>
        <p>She was a clever person, and he did not mind dealing with her.</p>
        <p>The last to arrive were the ones from the Mystic Purge Clan.</p>

        <p>
          It was also a clan with a lot of mystery... and the worst reputation
          among exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were quite infamous for their cruelty and inhuman behavior even
          towards their fellow exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          While he did find information about Nadia, it was severely limited.
          Even the elders were powerless about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the limited knowledge, he was aware that Nadia was an
          extraordinary genius even among her siblings. As per the rumors, she
          was also the most likely person to become the next matriarch of the
          clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, he was very interested in making connections with her due
          to this sole reason and those two girls from the Celestial Paradox
          Clan.
        </p>
        <p>But what made him perplexed was the guy behind Nadia.</p>
        <p>
          He introduced himself as Oliver and was the twin sibling of Nadia,
          but...
        </p>
        <p>He was not mentioned in the information.</p>
        <p>
          He suddenly came out of nowhere... and what was even more disturbing
          was that he could not sense much espera from his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, the artifact that he was carrying was buzzing when it
          was in Nadia's presence, the intensity similar to the two sisters from
          the Celestial Paradox Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when he tried to use the artifact on Oliver, the artifact did not
          produce even the slightest bit of reaction.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Nothing, absolutely nothing.</p>
        <p>Was the artifact not working?</p>

        <p>It was as if Oliver was not even worth noting.</p>
        <p>
          He even tried to sense it himself, but all he found was merely above
          average espera from him.
        </p>
        <p>He became suspicious of his strength.</p>
        <p>
          And then, to confirm his suspicions, Oliver just now backed off from a
          duel as if hesitant to even face off against them.
        </p>
        <p>Did he know that he was weak and thus did not want to fight them?</p>
        <p>
          If this was indeed the case, then he must be removed first from their
          group. He had read about it countless times in countless books.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having someone inept in a team was more lethal than being surrounded
          by a horde of demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they were going to familiarize themselves with each other and form
          a possible group or alliance of sorts, then Oliver should be removed
          beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The suggestion by Bella was the best way and was at the best time as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not get a better opportunity than this to test out Oliver and
          his skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could confirm his doubts and at the same time show him the
          difference between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not feel any particular hatred towards him, but he could not
          afford a weak companion in the future if they were going to be
          together more.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it was good for Oliver too. His life would be saved from any
          danger they might be facing in the future.
        </p>

        <p>So he cut him off and agreed on his behalf as well.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at Alphonso with a dumbfounded expression. He didn't
          expect this noble-looking guy to be a brute as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had always felt that bonding through fighting was not correct.
          Rather than bonding, in most cases, it was more of a matter of
          establishing a hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at Nadia from the corner of his eye, he could see her
          expressionless look, but he could feel a hint of anger in her eyes for
          some reason.
        </p>
        <p>Was it his imagination?</p>
        <p>
          What he didn't realize just now was that the anger in her eyes was for
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, while he had been cut off, he did not think much of it and
          ignored it, but she saw how he was cut off not once but twice in a
          row.
        </p>
        <p>First was that girl called Bella, and then this dumb-looking guy.</p>
        <p>
          This was clearly disrespectful, not to him alone but to the clan as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they were here as the representatives of their respective clans,
          then being interrupted while speaking simply equate to the opinion of
          their clan being ignored?
        </p>
        <p>
          While she herself was not interested in chatting with this bunch of
          dumb kids, she did not mind Oliver talking on her behalf as well. But
          seeing him being cut off like this made her feel disrespected too.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan must not be disrespected; this was the main motive for her in
          this meeting.
        </p>
        <p>She was here to establish her dominance over these people.</p>
        <p>
          Plus, for some reason, she hated the way that Bella was talking so
          casually with Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>A bunch of useless people.</p>
        <p>She was not going to let it slide.</p>
        <p>
          "Then it's decided. I will call an elder over and we should start
          right away, how about it? We will draw lots and match the two. Since
          Amber and Daniel are in an argument, they can duel it out. The rest of
          us will draw," Bella suggested.
        </p>
        <p>All the others agreed, so Oliver had to as well in the end.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 102: Nadia takes revenge on his behalf</h2>
        <p>'FUCK!'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver cursed internally as he looked at the opponent's name on the
          paper slip.
        </p>
        <p>He glanced toward Bella and weakly nodded.</p>
        <p>His expression was grim as he saw his energetic opponent.</p>
        <p>He did not want to fight her…</p>
        <p>She was a crazy girl.</p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry, it's a friendly match! Just show me your skills and
          let's get along well," Bella said in a reassuring tone, which did not
          comfort him at all. Rather, he felt exhausted.
        </p>
        <p>The matching order was as follows:</p>
        <p>Nadia - Alphonso</p>
        <p>Oliver - Bella</p>
        <p>Daniel - Amber</p>
        <p>
          As for Evelyn, well, since there was no one to match her against, she
          was the odd one left out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver offered to exchange places with her, but Bella strongly
          insisted on fighting with him rather than her sister, whom she was
          used to. She said she wanted to see how children from other clans
          compared to herself.
        </p>
        <p>He heard the elder's call and went to him with the others.</p>
        <p>
          "Well then, this is just a friendly duel to know each other's skills.
          You all are going to be together in the future, so try to bond better.
          You are smart and should know that anything excessive is forbidden. I
          will be watching over and will intervene if I feel so."
        </p>

        <p>
          He glanced at Daniel and Amber as he said this, silently warning them
          beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having unsettled grudges was not good for a team, and it was best to
          resolve them as soon as possible lest they interfere later in critical
          moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two, feeling the elder's cold gaze, shrank slightly. This duel was
          the best way.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder knew it was best for them to establish a hierarchy so they
          could all remain competitive and disciplined in the long run.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the other elders also had no objections to this duel since putting
          up an objection would only mean that their clan was weaker than the
          others.
        </p>
        <p>The first match was between Nadia and Alphonso.</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso wanted to fight Oliver himself to properly assess his skills,
          but he was matched against Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he did not mind this since he trusted that watching the duel
          between Bella and Oliver would be quite good too. Bella was stronger
          than any of them and should easily help him evaluate.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well then, we should get started too," he said, looking at Nadia. For
          some reason, he felt cold. Was the stare in her gaze indifferent and
          cold?
        </p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the duel started normally at first.</p>
        <p>
          But as it went on, the people around started to realize something. It
          seemed that Alphonso was being ruthlessly beaten.
        </p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          The fight had suddenly turned one-sided, with Nadia continuously
          beating Alphonso.
        </p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          "Wait—pfft!" As Alphonso tried to say something, a hard fist landed on
          his face, sending him flying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia did not allow him to speak a word as she mercilessly and
          humiliatingly crushed him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The face of the elder from the Fallen Heart Clan was worth watching.
          He was red with shame.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seeing the heir he had brought so proudly being brutally beaten
          one-sidedly was a great shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          The other elders had amused expressions, watching Nadia beat the heir
          of the Fallen Heart Clan like that. This clearly showed the superior
          talent the Mystic Purge Clan had raised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, the one getting beaten felt like crying. He could feel
          Nadia exacting some sort of revenge against him.
        </p>
        <p>"Cough, cough…"</p>
        <p>
          He coughed out spit as another kick connected straight to his abdomen
          with great force.
        </p>
        <p>"I-I conce—Ugh!"</p>
        <p>
          Before he could surrender, Nadia made a leg swing directly under his
          chin, rendering him unconscious.
        </p>
        <p>"Miss Nadia is the victor."</p>
        <p>
          There was a deferential silence in the surroundings as no one reacted
          for a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the bruised and swollen Alphonso, they could not help but
          feel pity.
        </p>
        <p>Damn! So brutal!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver exclaimed in his heart, looking at Nadia in a new light. He
          could never be this ruthless in a friendly duel.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only imagine how she would have tortured him had it been a
          duel of life and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder from the Fallen Heart Clan quickly poured a healing potion
          into Alphonso's mouth as he shot a glare toward the girl.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia, however, was unfazed and looked at them emotionlessly.</p>
        <p>
          Well, to Oliver, this result was quite obvious considering that Nadia
          was already a Rank-1 exorcist.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bella and Evelyn had a small frown as they looked at the scene. They
          did not feel comfortable. Nadia should have allowed her opponent to
          surrender if he wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huff… Huff…" Alphonso huffed as he looked at Nadia with a hint of
          fear. He would never approach her in his life.
        </p>
        <p>Who knows, after today he might get gynophobia.</p>
        <p>He quickly went to the corner with the elder.</p>
        <p>_____________</p>
        <p>
          "Next up, Young Miss Bella and Young Master Oliver, please come
          forward," the elder spoke to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at Bella, and she appeared calm, but her expression hid
          a hint of excitement.
        </p>
        <p>"You can start," the elder said simply as he went back to watch.</p>
        <p>
          "Well then, do you want to get the first attack?" Bella asked
          curiously, seemingly aware of his earlier hesitation and lack of
          confidence. So she offered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can we decide the victor with rock, paper, and scissors instead?"
          Oliver asked back.
        </p>
        <p>Bella smiled slightly as she said, "Then I will start first."</p>
        <p>
          As she said this, she almost vanished from her spot, appearing behind
          the dazed Oliver who was still looking at the previous spot where she
          was standing.
        </p>
        <p>'You are wide open.'</p>
        <p>
          Her hand turned into a chop as she aimed for his back, intending to
          land a blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, what happened next was completely out of her expectations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver blurred from his spot, and her eyes widened. She was just about
          to connect her hit when he dodged from his previous spot, making her
          chop hit nothing but air.
        </p>
        <p>
          She almost lost her balance for a second, and in that very second, she
          felt him behind her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Twisting her body with force, she blocked an incoming fist to her face
          with a fist of her own.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew how fast she reacted in that instant. Even a moment's delay
          would have cost her dearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had unconsciously used a great deal of force behind the fist that
          she used to counter him. It was all due to her instinct warning her of
          the danger.
        </p>
        <p>'Oh no, I used too much force—'</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 103: Bella Vs. Oliver</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 103</h2>
        <p>'Oh no, I used too much force—'</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          The fists collided, and both were flung backward due to the sheer
          impact of the collision.
        </p>
        <p>'Urk!'</p>
        <p>
          Bella's expression shifted as she inspected her fingers in surprise.
          It was an expected reaction, after all.
        </p>
        <p>'They are numb.'</p>
        <p>
          Moments ago, she had exerted a significant amount of force
          unintentionally due to the sudden situation. She intended to
          apologize, but who would have expected that he would not only counter
          her but emerge unscathed?
        </p>
        <p>
          And since her fingers felt this way, didn't that indicate the force
          behind his counter was equal to or greater than hers?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver appeared as calm as before, as if he did not even feel any pain
          or numbness from the previous collision.
        </p>
        <p>'This guy…'</p>
        <p>
          Bella's face broke into a wide smile. She could tell from his
          expression that he did not feel anything from the previous impact, but
          her fist was burning as if she had hit a heavy boulder.
        </p>
        <p>'He is not weak at all.'</p>
        <p>She had to admit this one thing.</p>
        <p>
          Earlier, when she tried to gauge his strength, his espera was barely
          above average, so she had underestimated him a little. Despite being
          taught not to disrespect her opponents, she still did it
          inadvertently.
        </p>

        <p>
          And she paid the price. Had he wanted to, he could have easily injured
          her with her guard lowered.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had not given it her all and held back in case she might injure
          him accidentally.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had just witnessed his sister's strength, and it was her mistake
          to underestimate him even after that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was she becoming arrogant due to her background? She should not forget
          that the person in front of her was not of any inferior background
          either. Just in terms of background alone, he was on par with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She let out a laugh while looking at him, "I am sorry for
          underestimating you earlier. I will not hold back anymore."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver stared at her with calm eyes. He didn't understand why was she
          apologizing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella cracked her knuckles as she rushed forward, but this time with
          greater speed and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver parried her with ease, his eyes showing a calmness like never
          before. After practicing continuously and having obtained a ten times
          stronger espera talent, he was naturally not worried about being
          defeated.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why practicing skills was always important. It was good that
          he had never slacked off his training just because of the presence of
          a system.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would never have gained this confidence if he hadn't put in the
          effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Strength and achievements you never worked hard for would never give
          you the confidence a person who toiled to obtain them would have.
        </p>
        <p>He knew this very well.</p>
        <p>
          Those main protagonists would suffer from an inferiority complex every
          moment of their life and always be doubtful of themselves just because
          they knew they never worked hard for their power.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was the same, but he felt that he deserved it after putting in all
          that effort since the beginning.
        </p>
        <p>Bam!</p>
        <p>Bam! Swish!</p>

        <p>
          Oliver repeatedly blocked all of Bella's strikes. He could feel the
          force behind them, but compared to his Level-5 strength, she was
          definitely lacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella became more and more desperate with each move that was getting
          blocked by him.
        </p>
        <p>She could not understand…</p>
        <p>
          She could not understand how she was not able to land even a single
          hit on him!
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt as if she was hitting a wall. Her hands had a numbness to them
          that was not there before. She felt that his skin was as tough as
          metal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, she was not using her espera since she could tell that
          Oliver had not used his either.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was frustrating her. Looking at him, he was as calm as water, as
          if her attacks couldn't even cause a ripple in his emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what infuriated her even more was the fact that he had not
          attacked her even once. He was simply blocking her swings or dodging.
        </p>
        <p>Gritting her teeth, she asked, "Why are you not attacking back…?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver blinked. He was busy thinking about her fighting style. From
          the beginning, he had been observing her stance, trying to decipher
          the martial arts she was using, but it seemed that he was not skilled
          enough to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Celestial Paradox Clan had great techniques, and Bella's movements
          were all unpredictable to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when she was close enough, he could still dodge or block her.
          He had to admit that she was consuming a lot of his energy to keep up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had he been a normal Rank-1 exorcist who had just broken through, he
          might not have been able to keep up with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the novel, it was mentioned that the sister of the main protagonist
          was very talented as well. She was just later overshadowed by the main
          protagonist and her achievements, but the fact remained unchanged that
          she also had the same blood as that of the protagonist running through
          her veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes honed as he saw another punch coming towards him. He
          dodged, but it turned out that it was a feint attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          He hurriedly turned around and jumped to the side, dodging the kick to
          his side by a hair's breadth.
        </p>

        <p>
          His left ear felt a ringing sensation as the wind generated by the
          kick went past him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the opponent and saw she had a frown on her forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not indulge her any longer. It was time to finish this. Since
          he knew if he stalled her any longer, she might truly get pissed off.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only reason he had been delaying this was to get some hints about
          her martial art technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't want her to awaken some broken ability in the middle of the
          fight due to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella looked at him and saw his eyes suddenly turn sharp. She knew
          that he was going to attack for the first time now.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, instead of rushing at him, she quickly assumed a defensive stance.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was an eerie silence around them except for the rhythmic tapping
          of Oliver's footsteps as he walked towards her like he was taking a
          stroll in the park.
        </p>
        <p>Tap Tap Tap</p>
        <p>
          Bella tensed. She was expecting him to surprise her again with his
          blinding speed. She was keeping an eye on him while also being ready
          to counter if he sneaked up behind her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her heart pounded in her chest, the sound almost deafening in the
          silent arena. The anticipation was like a coiled spring inside her,
          ready to snap at any moment. She knew better than to underestimate him
          again, and the stillness around them only heightened the tension.
        </p>
        <p>
          But contrary to her expectations, he did not do that. Rather, he was
          simply walking up to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          His movements were unhurried, almost casual, yet every step he took
          seemed to echo with purpose. He appeared to be full of openings that
          even a kid could attack him, but Bella knew better.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a walking bait, enticing his opponents to pounce on him only to
          realize that he was the predator in bait's disguise.
        </p>
        <p>Tap Tap Tap</p>
        <p>
          The distance between them closed, and Bella could see the minute
          details of his face, the slight narrowing of his eyes, the controlled
          breath, each signifying an underlying strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, she found his eyes quite beautiful... they looked
          magical and hypnotic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was now very close to Bella. The distance between them was
          minimal. She was still in a defensive stance, not moving an inch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver stretched his hand back, and under Bella's narrowed gaze, at an
          insane speed, attacked her directly.
        </p>
        <p>Bella was amazed at the speed, but she was prepared.</p>
        <p>BANG!</p>
        <p>'Ugh-!'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 104: Did she win...?</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 104</h2>
        <p>BANG!</p>
        <p>
          "Ugh-!" she groaned as she experienced the strength of a ten-times
          enhanced Rank-1 exorcist. Her eyes could not help but widen as she
          resisted the force behind the blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huff…" she managed to resist, but her arms felt numb due to the
          impact.
        </p>
        <p>'No choice but to use espera.'</p>
        <p>She thought as a glint passed through her eyes.</p>
        <p>
          Her body started to glow in a white hue as she looked at Oliver with
          determined eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>Oliver suddenly felt a great force striking his back.</p>
        <p>Gasp!</p>
        <p>He clutched his back in pain; he didn't see her move behind him.</p>
        <p>
          It seemed using espera turned her into a completely different person.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was understandable, considering she was never a physical exorcist
          like he was.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her skills with using espera were far superior to ordinary children,
          so it was not a shock that she was able to corner him.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Oliver was not weak either. He immediately used espera as
          well, a burst of powerful espera radiated from his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not particularly tremendous, but it was enough to increase his
          agility and strength a bit.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          The next scene was nothing but a flurry of strikes and moves, both
          sides dodging and attacking continuously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella could feel his strength; it was not inferior to hers. Rather,
          she would say it was greater than hers…
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a surprise. She had always listened to her elders saying that
          she was the most talented in her generation and stood at the pinnacle
          compared to her peers on the same level.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, meeting someone smaller than her with even greater strength…
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not know what to feel, but it did induce a bitter feeling
          inside her, followed by a strong determination to overcome him and be
          the strongest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fight intensified as the spectators could only watch in amazement
          as the two youngsters fought elegantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella was formidable, and her attacks were agile and powerful.
          However, Oliver remained unfazed and dodged her attacks without
          getting hit much; he even found openings from time to time to attack
          her weak points.
        </p>
        <p>'It's time to end this.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at the slightly panting girl with a smile as she gritted
          her teeth and flexed her muscles, channeling power in her fist as she
          again blurred from her spot, only to attack him from the front.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time he did not dodge but instead made a surprised face as if he
          had been caught off guard, which looked quite natural too, considering
          the dust clouds around them obscuring the vision.
        </p>

        <p>Bella pushed forward, aiming at his chest.</p>
        <p>BANG!</p>
        <p>"Ahh-!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver let out a painful shriek as he flung his body backward,
          followed by a crash into nearby trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cough-!" he coughed up and fell to the ground, clutching his chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was flawless in his act as the dust clouds around them slowly
          settled down.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the spectators saw was Oliver lying on the ground clutching his
          chest and a stunned Bella who still had her fingers curled into a
          fist, paused mid-air.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder was not surprised and announced, "Miss Bella is the victor."
        </p>
        <p>
          However, instead of the laughter from the elders that was there at the
          time when Alphonso was beaten and defeated, there was instead a calm
          atmosphere without much noise.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the children might not have been able to see it, the elders with
          their advanced senses were able to peer into the details. The way
          Oliver fought was like he was handling a child.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was easily able to counter Bella in every way possible. Not only
          that, but his speed and strength were also clearly superior to hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Except for his above-average espera, which made them confused, how
          could a genius like him have such a level of espera?
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, some of them even had suspicions that he lost on purpose,
          they did not understand why but they still remained silent and
          observed.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>Was he a true genius in physical exorcism?</p>

        <p>
          They were caught up in the fight between these two young kids. While
          it was not too splendid, they still saw the clash of two geniuses.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one dared to mock at this moment. It would be stupid to offend such
          a genius when he could later grow up to be a powerhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder from the Mystic Purge Clan did not move from his spot.
          Oliver was not too injured, so he did not have to go and give him
          healing potions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was busy observing the young lady from the Celestial Paradox Clan.
          As the rumors had suggested, she indeed had a knack for both martial
          arts and espera techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could see how smoothly espera was flowing inside her body. It was
          very smooth and without any blockages, as if it was natural.
        </p>
        <p>Such flow indicated her talent as an exorcist.</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso was also silent at this point. He had already learned his
          lesson. Never in his life was he going to underestimate anyone from
          the Mystic Purge Clan from this moment forth.
        </p>
        <p>He swore it in his heart.</p>
        <p>
          He could tell that Oliver was a seriously talented guy, even more so
          than him to some extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to admit it painfully. He doubted that he could last even a
          minute under that sort of monstrous strength and energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was able to console himself, thinking how he was still ahead of him
          in espera and the amount of espera they had.
        </p>
        <p>The only thing he could feel somewhat proud of…</p>
        <p>
          He also felt relieved that he did not outright belittle him earlier
          based on his suspicions alone.
        </p>
        <p>Everyone around them was praising the good fight.</p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Bella remained silent. She was standing still on her spot
          alone, her eyes dazed as she was in deep thought.
        </p>
        <p>The last scene of the fight repeated in her mind.</p>
        <p>
          Just when she was about to deliver her punch, for a split second, she
          felt as if she saw him move and press his palm against her incoming
          fist, producing a feeling of impact. The next thing she knew, he was
          already flung back, crashing directly into a tree.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention her fist was now entirely numb. She was barely able
          to feel her fingers after that impact.
        </p>
        <p>'Did I really defeat him…?'</p>
        <p>She frowned, this was not acceptable.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 105: Nadia's Wrath! Bella's Reluctance!</h2>
        <p>'Did I really defeat him…?'</p>
        <p>She looked conflicted; she knew it was impossible.</p>
        <p>
          She had already prepared herself in some corner of her mind that today
          she was going to suffer the first defeat of her life at the hands of
          this silver-haired, frail-looking boy.
        </p>
        <p>
          But contrary to this, she somehow was able to win even after all that.
        </p>
        <p>What was that supposed to mean?</p>
        <p>Did he expect her to believe that?</p>
        <p>Did he think she would accept this?</p>
        <p>Why did he do this?</p>
        <p>What was the reason?</p>
        <p>
          Questions clouded her brain, making her overthink, a bad habit she had
          since she was born.
        </p>
        <p>
          'No… I refuse to believe this. He definitely did something at the last
          moment.'
        </p>
        <p>
          She was more willing to believe that he was so insanely fast that she
          was not able to even catch a glimpse of his movement at the end than
          to believe that she won against someone who had been parrying her
          moves from the beginning without effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          She slowly walked up to him, who was still clutching his chest in pain
          and acting like he was really hit badly by her.
        </p>
        <p>She didn't care as she bent down and grabbed his collar.</p>
        <p>She roughly pulled him up and slammed him back against the tree.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver, who was enjoying the reactions of those around him, was
          stunned by the sudden grab on his collar and the slam.
        </p>

        <p>"???"</p>
        <p>He looked at her in confusion.</p>
        <p>Didn't you win? What happened?</p>
        <p>
          Instead of a gloating expression, what he saw was entirely the
          opposite. She was glaring at him with fierce eyes as she snarled.
        </p>
        <p>"What did you do in the end?"</p>
        <p>Her eyes met his at that moment.</p>
        <p>
          "Stop acting. I know you cannot be beaten by that attack. Not of that
          level. Why did you get thrown like this!? Answer me!"
        </p>
        <p>
          She yelled at him, drawing the attention of the audience who looked at
          her with equally confused eyes as Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          The expression of the elder from the Celestial Paradox Clan changed
          greatly at this time. He knew that the elder young miss was somewhat
          battle-crazed, but he did not know it was this serious.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, he still did not move, since the other elders were watching.
          He did not take any action, especially when the one from the Mystic
          Purge Clan was also looking at the duo with an unreadable expression.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver could not help but curse.</p>
        <p>
          He thought he had been quite fast at the end and would have surely
          evaded her senses, but did she actually catch him doing the fake act?
        </p>
        <p>Looking at her desperate and angry expression, he went silent.</p>
        <p>Indeed, he had intentionally lost, but so what?</p>
        <p>
          He wanted to do so and did it. Bella was the role model of her younger
          sister, the main protagonist.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the eyes of her sister, she had always been the best. She was
          undefeated and the most powerful…
        </p>
        <p>
          She was necessary for Evelyn to become stronger… she could not be
          defeated in front of her little sister.
        </p>

        <p>If he defeated her now, he would be…</p>
        <p>He would be… what?</p>
        <p>
          Why did he not defeat her? Why didn't he care about his own dignity?
        </p>
        <p>Was it as simple as something for the sake of the plot?</p>
        <p>He was not sure why…</p>
        <p>
          But he didn't want to defeat her earlier. For some reason, he wanted
          her to maintain the image she had presented in front of her sister so
          far.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind could not help but go back to a scene from his previous life
          where he was with his elder sister.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he was a disabled kid in his previous life, his sister had
          always acted as a shield in front of him…
        </p>
        <p>
          She was excellent both in academics and sports, a role model for him
          and her peers.
        </p>
        <p>
          But something tragic happened when she got into an unfortunate
          accident and lost her ability to walk.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was quickly declared to never be able to walk by the doctors, and
          the wheelchair became a permanent companion in her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was able to witness how her life changed right before his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          How the always bright and cheerful girl turned into a shadow of her
          former self.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their parents did support them however they were able to, but with
          both of their kids being disabled now, they were also distressed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was there when he noticed this shift in his sister at that time.
          Before losing her legs, she was the best sister he could ever ask for.
        </p>
        <p>
          He noticed how her once so-called 'best friends' slowly cut off
          contact with her, leaving her alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he was still there for her. Even if his eyes were not the
          best, he still helped her in every way possible. But he knew that she
          was cutting herself off from everyone slowly.
        </p>

        <p>He was also helpless too… He wanted to…</p>
        <p>
          He was drawn out of his thoughts when Bella shook him slightly, asking
          him the reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          She saw how he was still silent even after being asked and could not
          help but feel even more frustrated.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't have even a bit of sweat on you. Are you even tired from
          the duel earlier… or is this a joke?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She eyed his hand still pressing against his chest where he was
          supposed to have been hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          She removed her hand holding him against the tree and gripped his hand
          on the chest, trying to pull it away to see if he was really as
          injured as he was supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just when she was about to pull his hand away, another hand suddenly
          intervened and gripped her wrist in a forceful manner.
        </p>
        <p>A chilling cold voice sounded in the silent area.</p>
        <p>"What do you think you are doing?"</p>
        <p>
          The voice was cold, and an overwhelming tension suddenly filled the
          air.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was Nadia. Her hand was now tightly gripping Bella's hand that was
          holding Oliver's hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this moment, her eyes were extremely cold, and her facial
          expressions could not be any more devoid of emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella felt the tight grip on her hand. The strength behind it was
          enough to crush the bones of a normal human.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia really intended to break her hand.</p>
        <p>"Sister…" Evelyn also went up to Bella and said anxiously.</p>
        <p>
          She had never seen her sister lose her composure like this before. To
          her, Bella had always been a calm and noble person.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was always the first to go to her opponent and see to their
          injuries after a duel.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, she didn't understand the situation when her sister was trying to
          bully an already defeated opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella ignored Evelyn and met Nadia's cold eyes. There was still a
          trace of unwillingness in her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>She wanted to know if Oliver was actually defeated or…</p>
        <p>
          The cold voice rang again, but this time, there was a hint of
          murderous intent in the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>"Move your hand."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 106: What did Bella do?</h2>
        <p>"Move your hand."</p>
        <p>
          Nadia's eyes blazed with an intensity that made those around her step
          back, sensing the storm brewing within her.
        </p>
        <p>Even Evelyn felt intimidated by the air.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia said again as she forcefully tore Bella's hand that was still
          gripping Oliver's.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could not express this moment, but when she saw earlier Oliver
          getting defeated even after hiding that dark power and strength to
          defeat a minor-level demon, her mood had soured and was a little
          disdainful as well.
        </p>
        <p>She could not believe that he still got defeated by that girl.</p>
        <p>
          However, when she saw her moving up to him even after defeating him
          and roughing him up, her blood started to boil.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could not control the sudden urge in her mind to kill Bella at
          that moment. It was an overbearing urge that almost made her lose her
          temper.
        </p>
        <p>Before she knew it, she was there, stopping her hand.</p>
        <p>She didn't know why…</p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>Bella, whose hand had been yanked away, also jerked up.</p>
        <p>
          A ripple of shock passed through the onlookers, everyone holding their
          breath as the tension crackled in the air.
        </p>

        <p>Her eyes, which had been full of anger, also trembled.</p>
        <p>
          She looked at Oliver, who was also speechlessly looking at this new
          drama unfolding.
        </p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>His eyelids could not help but twitch wildly.</p>
        <p>
          He was currently experiencing the feeling of a heroine in a TV show
          for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I… I am sorry," Bella instantly bowed down to him, "Please forgive me
          for my earlier misconduct… I don't know what got into me that made me
          do that to you…even though you were already injured…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes could not help but moisten up slightly; she was feeling like
          trash right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Umm," Oliver also felt bad for making her feel like this because of
          his fake act.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, she was still a little girl, he sighed, "It's fine. I am
          not angry."
        </p>
        <p>
          He chuckled softly, "Instead, I can understand the feeling of not
          being able to fight to your heart's content with a rival, haha."
        </p>
        <p>"I apologize for not being up to your expectation hahaha."</p>
        <p>He lightly waved his hand and diffused the tense atmosphere.</p>
        <p>
          Bella also nodded weakly, she was about to cry in front of so many
          people!
        </p>
        <p>
          If she had done that, she would not have any face left in the future.
          Her expression was as red as a tomato.
        </p>

        <p>
          While everyone heaved a sigh of relief that the situation did not
          escalate much, Nadia was still holding onto his kimono.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her with question marks on his face as he whispered.
        </p>
        <p>"Ahem, thanks, Nadia. Thanks for helping me."</p>
        <p>
          Hearing his gratitude, she slowly released his clothes and went back
          without looking at anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver shook his head and retrieved a healing potion from his mind
          space and drank its contents to show others that he was really injured
          just now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why had he lost on purpose? Maybe he just wanted her to maintain an
          image in front of her sister, or maybe he did not want to get involved
          in the plot early?
        </p>
        <p>
          It could be anything, but he did what his heart wanted at that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps, in the future, he should not act like this in front of her…
        </p>
        <p>
          The little incident was foiled quickly, and the next duel was between
          Amber and Daniel, the root cause of everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          The match was intense. Daniel, being the sword prodigy he was, used a
          variety of sword moves and impressive sword arts as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was tempted to get those techniques, but the system did not
          detect him as a binding character.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, anyways, he could just get them from the Sacred Sword Clan in
          the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber, on the other hand, was an exorcist specializing in tools and
          was using all sorts of weird-looking tools Oliver had never ever seen
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he was interested as they were helping her to stop Daniel
          very effectively.
        </p>

        <p>
          He might consider buying them from her in the future if the chance
          arises.
        </p>
        <p>
          The duel was a bit longer, and neither side was winning; both were
          looking exhausted but still kept their opponent at bay.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was what a duel between the young heirs of five major clans
          should look like ideally, but well, the first duel ended up in
          crushing defeat of Alphonso and the second one was also quite weird,
          they still did not know the reason for Bella's sudden outbreak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing the state of the two, the elder finally stepped forward without
          wasting more of anyone's time and announced in a clear voice.
        </p>
        <p>"This duel is now being declared as a draw between the two."</p>
        <p>
          After the elder's words, both of them collapsed on their spots in
          exhaustion; they were equally matched with one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both had a newfound glint in their eyes. Daniel got up and walked up
          to Amber as he extended his hand to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am sorry for before, I lost temper too suddenly… You are indeed
          quite skilled; there has never been a fight where I have not been able
          to reach my opponent close."
        </p>
        <p>Amber looked at his hand and caught it as she slowly stood up.</p>
        <p>
          "I am sorry too, I was rude in the beginning, it was my fault for
          ignoring you." she looked at him with apologetic eyes and an
          embarrassed look.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, well, I was also at fault for being partial towards women… I-I
          shouldn't have said that."
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, they managed to patch up things under the watchful eyes of
          the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I believe you guys must be familiar with each other through this."
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the elders came forward and said as he looked at the children
          present one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now we will be having you quiet down for a bit and tell you all about
          some of the plans we have for your future."
        </p>
        <p>The crowd quickly settled in order.</p>
        <p>
          "You all should know about the purpose of today's meeting; it was a
          joint-training program, but you should know what the end goal of this
          is? Why did we even plan this?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He asked as Alphonso added, "Isn't it to make us stronger for the
          future?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed that is one of the reasons behind this, but there's another
          major reason behind this, the end goal of this program is to make you
          all strong enough to participate in The Perpetual Plane."
        </p>
        <p>Perpetual Plane!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 107: Perpetual Plane?</h2>
        <p>Perpetual Plane!</p>
        <p>Oliver's eyes couldn't help but flicker fiercely.</p>
        <p>
          Memories from the novel refreshed in his mind as he realized where
          this was going…
        </p>
        <p>
          The Perpetual Plane was an entirely detached space built by the
          legends of the past, where the strong exorcists from the ancient era
          poured their resources together and formed this isolated space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main purpose for the creation of this plane was to serve as a
          trial to the young and promising children and give them opportunities
          to grow stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just so that only the ones worthy would get the opportunity, the plane
          was filled with obstacles and deadly beasts captured and released into
          that isolated space.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an important place in ancient times when the war was heavy and
          promising youth died young due to the terror spread by the demonic
          forces.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no peaceful place for them to grow before the demons invaded
          and killed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So the council of decision-makers at that time resorted to this
          method. With the help of multiple exorcists, they were able to develop
          and manage this wide-scaled space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, this tradition was continued by the clans and the Perpetual
          Plane just kept getting richer in resources and even bigger but at the
          same time dangerous too.
        </p>

        <p>
          The beasts inside mutated to grow even stronger by consuming resources
          and dense espera, so it was since then that the clan only sent highly
          trained younglings inside who would emerge out to be more powerful and
          with ancient treasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a strict restriction placed to limit the eligibility
          criteria to being till Rank-3, which was the cap limit.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not possible for anyone stronger to enter, forceful means might
          even distort the coordinates of the Perpetual Plane making it lost in
          the boundless space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, no one was willing to take such a risk considering the
          amount of secret ancient treasures still inside the realm; who knows
          there might be epic-rank artifacts inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the Perpetual Plane was an excellent opportunity that only a
          few would ever obtain in their lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would not only make them stronger but also provide a scope for them
          to get life-changing treasures inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elder, what is Perpetual Plane?" Amber asked, she didn't know about
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Perpetual Plane is a secret space that is opened once every
          century and is a place filled with unknown ancient treasures and
          dangers from the past. It is a dangerous place, but for someone
          strong, it's a place filled with opportunities."
        </p>
        <p>The elder briefed her about it.</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes shone as she heard the words 'treasures' and 'unknown
          opportunities'.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it was not just her but the others also had their eyes shining in
          excitement.
        </p>

        <p>
          After all, who among them was not ambitious enough, they all wanted to
          become strong and get many treasures.
        </p>
        <p>However, one of them had a pale expression at the moment.</p>
        <p>
          It was none other than Oliver, his expression was abnormal at the
          moment and didn't look good.
        </p>
        <p>
          'No way, the Perpetual Plane… in the novel, it was definitely
          mentioned that only the protagonist and Nadia were able to enter the
          Plane, as for the rest of the heirs, there was not even a mention of
          them.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver panicked now. In the novel, it was around the time when the
          Perpetual Plane was opened, however, only Nadia and Evelyn were the
          ones to actually enter the Plane.
        </p>
        <p>There was not even a mention of the other heirs at all.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver realized he was thinking too much in an instant so he gradually
          calmed himself; it was not the time to overthink but instead calmly
          analyze the situation before him with a clear and sharp mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Did this mean that something happened during the joint-training
          program that made them unable to enter… did they all die? What exactly
          happened?'
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not sure but he could tell that there was definitely something
          that had happened during the joint-training program that rendered
          everyone except the two unable to enter the Perpetual Plane.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was calm, at least, this helped him know that something would
          happen during this joint-training period and it would not pass
          peacefully.
        </p>
        <p>He had to be on guard as well.</p>

        <p>
          "Elder, what will be doing in this joint-training?" Alphonso
          questioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You will be learning under an expert together; after your training,
          you will be familiarized with the job of an exorcist where you'll be
          led to deal with actual terrors and problems of the world, of course,
          according to your level, it will be adjusted."
        </p>
        <p>They nodded in understanding.</p>
        <p>
          "Who will we be under? I assume it's someone noteworthy considering
          our standings."
        </p>
        <p>Daniel said, proud of his background and bloodline.</p>
        <p>
          The elder glanced at him, under the gaze of the elder, he could not
          help but quieten down and shrink.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The expert is a veteran exorcist who retired from the battlefield a
          long time ago, he is someone who was the bane of demons in his time,
          he slaughtered countless demons and stood at the front. Now he has
          been especially invited by the clans to teach you kids so you better
          be respectful to him."
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the standing elders cautioned them to not do something
          disrespectful, the man they had invited was not someone to be taken
          lightly after all.
        </p>
        <p>"Who is it?" Oliver asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Dennis Rivera," the elder mentioned his name finally, but all he
          received were confused looks from the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed, it was a reaction he was already expecting, he didn't
          expect them to know about every valiant exorcist in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the person they invited was special, there were countless
          ancient exorcists famous for their exorcism and fame. So it was
          natural for those with lesser fame to be suppressed in the meantime.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver also pursed his lips, he also had no idea who this man was
          supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was most likely a side-character since he was not mentioned in the
          story or if he was, then it was so insignificant that he didn't bother
          to remember his name.
        </p>
        <p>"So, are we going to be meeting him today?"</p>
        <p>
          "No, today was just arranged for you all to be familiar with one
          another. That's all. We will be leaving after a meeting so do whatever
          you want in the meantime."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, the group of elders left the children alone and went to
          discuss some important topics that definitely involved the void cloud
          phenomenon that happened in the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 108: Once-in-a-lifetime offer or...?</h2>
        <p>
          Oliver hung out with the other children as the elders continued their
          meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone discussed the strange phenomenon that had occurred in his
          clan some time ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to avoid talking about the Void Cloud Phenomenon, which had
          happened a while back. But Amber cornered him and started bugging him
          about it. Oliver tried to change the subject, but Amber kept nagging
          him about it.
        </p>
        <p>Finally, Oliver told her to leave him alone and walked away.</p>
        <p>
          He knew he was not a tolerant person, so before he was further tested,
          he decided to just walk away and leave the rest to Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          He informed the maid that he was going to wander the forest and asked
          her to let the elder know once he's back and about to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was better to be in this beautiful forest alone and appreciate the
          surroundings. He had always liked greenery; even behind his courtyard,
          there was a place filled with trees that he had made his secret spot
          of comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forest was silent except for the occasional melodious chirping
          sounds.
        </p>
        <p>He sat against a tree and rested as he enjoyed the shade…</p>
        <p>
          Unknowingly, he fell asleep in the calm and peaceful atmosphere. He
          was in the embrace of nature and surrounded by tall ancient trees. The
          smell of wooden bark and the gentle rustle of winds against his skin
          made him particularly relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some time passed, it was a silent and relaxing sleep… until he felt
          some sort of uneasiness in his heart as he quickly opened his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          He realized that he was no longer in the forest… but instead, he
          seemed to be in another unfamiliar place.
        </p>

        <p>
          The surroundings had shifted from lush green to barren land filled
          with dried-out trees, completely opposite the previous lush green
          scenery.
        </p>
        <p>He confusedly looked around, where was he?</p>
        <p>
          He was just taking a relaxing nap for a moment, and the next thing he
          knew was that he was here.
        </p>
        <p>Damn!</p>
        <p>
          He cursed under his breath, he couldn't even get a moment's worth of
          relief, he really could not let his guard down in this world, even in
          something as peaceful as this forest.
        </p>
        <p>This was such a harmless-looking forest and now this happened.</p>
        <p>
          He should have been more careful when the surroundings were this
          silent.
        </p>
        <p>'Fuck, but where am I?'</p>
        <p>
          He looked around and as far as his eyes could travel. all he saw was
          barren land and dying trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          He still felt it would not be too late before the elders noticed his
          absence. He had an inkling that he was still in the same forest for
          some reason.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          He heard a whistling sound behind him and turned back only to see
          something unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Particles made out of light were slowly gathering in one spot as soon
          as a figure made purely out of bright light emerged or more like
          formed in front of his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>He narrowed his eyes, properly examining this thing.</p>

        <p>"Who are you?"</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the creature with a humanoid build and undefined
          features; he wanted to know if the thing ahead understood what he
          said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He heard a deep voice in his ears as he asked this, it most likely
          belonged to the thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am a spirit." The thing's face started to turn more defined as he
          further spoke, "I am one of the guardians of this forest, a forest
          spirit."
        </p>
        <p>
          The face of the spirit turned fully clear as an old man's face was
          formed with a long beard.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why did you bring me here?" he suppressed his shock and asked the
          main thing first.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you see the barren land in front of you?" The old spirit with a
          sad look in his eyes asked.
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          The spirit's form flickered for a moment as he looked back at the
          nonchalant Oliver again.
        </p>
        <p>
          In return, Oliver also glared at the old spirit, his intent was clear.
        </p>
        <p>What was the reason he was brought out here and where he was?</p>
        <p>The old spirit shook his head and answered.</p>

        <p>
          "This is a separate space that belongs to me exclusively; the scenery
          in front of your eyes right now is the future of this forest. In some
          years, the demons would wage a war and the flames of war will consume
          this beautiful land, plundering it of resources and nature's wealth."
        </p>
        <p>The old spirit took a deep breath as he continued,</p>
        <p>
          "I had brought you here after sensing a great power coiling inside
          your body. I am sure you have never seen a spirit before, my child."
        </p>
        <p>
          A kind look appeared on the old man's face as he continued, "I really
          hope that you can help me protect this beautiful land which had been
          there for a few centuries now."
        </p>
        <p>
          "This here is the future of this land, this beautiful forest that I am
          showing you… don't you feel sad? Looking at these beautiful and green
          trees turning dead…"
        </p>
        <p>"I don't."</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>This guy was really outrageous!</p>
        <p>
          The old spirit could not help but twitch violently after hearing him.
        </p>
        <p>Looking at the angry old man, Oliver sighed as he finally said.</p>
        <p>
          "Why did you bring me here? And even if I feel bad about it, what help
          do you want from me?"
        </p>
        <p>The restless spirit beamed when he heard Oliver.</p>
        <p>"It's really simple; you just need to form a contract with me."</p>
        <p>
          Before Oliver could again reject him, the old man quickly quoted his
          benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's really beneficial for you too! You will gain enormous strength
          if you form a contract with me."
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man excitedly continued, "Not only will this forest become a
          place where you will gain an advantage, but you will also be able to
          use my powers as a spirit as per the contract. The only thing is that
          I would need from you is half of your espera as a payment."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Also, this is very normal; some spirits even exchange all your espera
          to form a contract. I am desperate, and that's why I am willing to
          sacrifice."
        </p>
        <p>The old man looked pitiful as if he was making a huge loss.</p>
        <p>
          He quickly added, "You don't need to think much, such occasions are
          very rare; spirits rarely interact with the material world. You might
          never meet a spirit your whole life. This is a once-in-a-lifetime
          opportunity for you!"
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 109: How did the ghost end up in this forest?</h2>
        <p>
          "You are a young exorcist, forming a contract with me would definitely
          put you ahead of your fellow peers! Your elders must have taught you,
          right? Power is everything; I can see from your eyes that you also
          want this," the old spirit eagerly spoke.
        </p>
        <p>"We should not waste any more time and quickly form a contra—"</p>
        <p>"What? Why would I form a contract with you?"</p>
        <p>Oliver interrupted as he sneered at the old spirit.</p>
        <p>
          Looking at his eyes which carried endless disdain, the old man was
          stunned.
        </p>
        <p>
          He again asked, "What do you mean? Don't you understand the benefits?
          Should I repeat them for you?"
        </p>
        <p>"I heard you loud and clear. No need to repeat that all."</p>
        <p>"Then why!?" the old man cried out.</p>
        <p>
          "First of all, there's no way I am going to form a contract with an
          old man such as yourself. Had it been a beautiful spirit, I might have
          considered, but there's no way I am going to make one with you."
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck! That's Ageist!" The old man rebelled.</p>
        <p>"…." Oliver</p>
        <p>
          "Anyways, I am not going to do it. Call me what you want, the second
          reason is you underestimating for an oblivious fool."
        </p>

        <p>"What does that mean?" the old man frowned.</p>
        <p>
          "Exactly what it sounds like. You want half of my espera as payment?
          Are you kidding me? A spirit never asks anything in return for forming
          a contract."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver scoffed as he pointed at the man.</p>
        <p>
          "You are no spirit. At least not anymore. You are a deception. A ghost
          specifically trying to imitate a spirit, but too bad, the foul scenery
          ahead; no spirit would ever do that when offering a contract."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You thought that I was naive and weak who had never seen a spirit
          before. But too bad for you, your cheap act of imitating a spirit was
          not even close to how a real spirit would be, hahaha."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver laughed out aloud in the eerie silence.</p>
        <p>
          "When did you realize this?" the old man asked in a low voice as the
          scenery behind started to flicker slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Humph. The moment you sensed the so-called great power within me. I
          am the weakest person among my peers. I don't know how a demonic being
          like you entered this forest but you made a huge mistake targeting
          this place as this shall be your grave."
        </p>
        <p>
          Listening to Oliver's arrogant words, the old ghost slowly turned
          angrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old ghost's eyes went back to recall how he had ended up in this
          accursed forest.
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>
          The old ghost was actually not a messy small ghost but instead a
          powerful demonic ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been assigned at the borders to slaughter exorcists, but he was
          surrounded and gravely wounded by some pesky exorcists.
        </p>

        <p>
          He somehow used every bit of his remaining espera to escape. However,
          he could only enter the territory of exorcists due to being
          surrounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcists were persistent and followed behind him. They chased
          after him madly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using their annoying exorcism methods, they somehow figured out his
          traces and pursued him like mad dogs.
        </p>
        <p>He was not even given a moment's worth of rest to recover.</p>
        <p>
          Being in an unfamiliar enemy territory with a group of dangerous
          exorcists following behind. He was given a run for his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          He, who would eat two exorcists for breakfast daily, was now being
          hunted down by the same exorcists and he was powerless.
        </p>
        <p>
          He needed to recover some of his espera if he even wanted to counter
          them or escape from this place infested by bugs called humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he continuously ran around, he somehow found this rich and dense
          forest with tall ancient trees. Without thinking much, he entered
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not because it was a good spot to hide but because he was smelling the
          presence of real spirits inside this forest; if he could somehow get
          his hands on one and eat it, not only would he recover back to his
          peak but might also have a breakthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spirits were one of the best nutrition for demons such as himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, when he reached the place inside the forest where the smell
          was originating from, he was frustrated to find that the spirit was
          sealed behind an ancient statue.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the statue was guarded by a strange array restriction that he
          dared not approach due to ominous espera nearby.
        </p>
        <p>
          He needed a physical body if he wanted to try and decipher the espera
          and break inside.
        </p>

        <p>He had to possess a body for that.</p>
        <p>
          But how could he even find a human body in this place, not to mention
          how would he even control the human given his weak espera at the
          moment that was still recovering.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then that he sensed multiple powerful presences near the forest
          entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cursed as he feared that his pursuers have found him and reached
          here.
        </p>
        <p>
          But upon closer look, these people were different. He could tell from
          their aura.
        </p>
        <p>They were a bunch of old humans with some children.</p>
        <p>
          Those old humans were extremely strong; he would not survive if he
          fought with them or if they sensed him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forest was a good place for blocking senses; he was quite far from
          them too. Using a good concealment technique special to ghosts like
          him, he was able to hide himself from their senses for the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          He eyed the children and he had to admit that they smelled delicious.
          His mouth was salivating as he sensed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          If only he could devour them and possess one of them to break the
          array.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spirit inside the statue was dormant; he could easily consume it.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, not only would he kill those pursuers of his but also
          devour this forest and its resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those children were constantly under the watch of those old
          powerful humans; he dared not approach them in case they sensed him
          and exorcised him.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the time being, he could only wait patiently for them to separate
          and find a chance later to possess one of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he waited, he noticed them mingling with each other and fighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at these childish battles, he could not help but feel disdain;
          these human children were nothing in front of their demon youngling
          with powerful bloodlines.
        </p>
        <p>They could easily kill them with a few punches.</p>
        <p>
          He patiently waited as they finished up with their things one by one.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 110: Turning tables! Why are you scared now?</h2>
        <p>
          It was getting frustrating for him when they didn't move away. He was
          considering leaving the forest for now to gain some distance from his
          pursuers, but it was at that moment when one of the children walked
          away from the herd.
        </p>
        <p>He could not help but gloat seeing that.</p>
        <p>
          Now all he had to do was possess this foolish human child and break
          the array in this forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that humans were lofty creatures, slaves to their desires. As
          long as he stirred enough emotions in this human, he should be easily
          able to gain control.
        </p>
        <p>Who knows that the human might even surrender willingly?</p>
        <p>
          Although for some reason, he was not able to gauge the power inside
          the kid, he assumed that the human was too weak—just like a bug.
        </p>
        <p>
          So he used his power to create a faint illusion and slowly brought the
          sleeping kid into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that as long as he presented a pitiful act and used this
          forest to draw out his sympathy, the human would fall for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was aware that spirits were creatures that rarely interacted with
          these humans, so he doubted that a child would have ever met or seen
          one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but to be more genuine, he even offered power to the
          human for forming a contract.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had just sensed that this human child barely had any noteworthy
          espera, so he should be greedy enough for more power and fame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, there was no power since he would be possessing the kid and
          killing him internally.
        </p>
        <p>So, he quickly presented his act to the kid.</p>
        <p>
          For some reason, this brat was quite arrogant and was pissing him off
          from time to time, but he endured it for the sake of devouring him
          later.
        </p>

        <p>He would make sure to give him a painful death at that time.</p>
        <p>
          However, even after all that, the human rejected him and his offer.
        </p>
        <p>He could not understand why?</p>
        <p>
          He asked for an explanation and upon hearing his first reason, his
          eyes could not help but turn bloodshot!
        </p>
        <p>
          This brat wanted a beautiful woman instead of an old man to offer him
          the contract?
        </p>
        <p>He would only sign a contract with a beautiful spirit?</p>
        <p>What logic was that?</p>
        <p>
          Didn't power reign supreme? Since when did these humans start to
          follow the religion of lust over power?
        </p>
        <p>Was he in his right mind?</p>
        <p>
          This was clearly a disrespect to him and his powers… this human was
          blatantly discriminating against spirits!
        </p>
        <p>So bold!</p>
        <p>
          But after hearing his second reason, he realized that he had been
          caught…
        </p>
        <p>
          And the reason he was caught was that he mentioned that this human
          child had a great power within?
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but curse. Looks like, in his injured state, he had
          lost his brain to be caught by a child of bugs.
        </p>
        <p>_______________</p>

        <p>"SO YOU KNEW! HAHAHA"</p>
        <p>
          The old ghost laughed manically, he was truly enraged by this whole
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "NO MATTER WHAT! TODAY YOU WILL BECOME A SACRIFICE!" the old ghost
          yelled, his figure turning distorted and blurry in front of Oliver's
          keen eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"WHETHER YOU WANT IT OR NOT… YOUR BODY NOW BELONGS TO ME!"</p>
        <p>
          The ghost literally screamed as he madly dashed into Oliver's body.
        </p>
        <p>In his spiritual form, he entered inside Oliver's body.</p>
        <p>
          If the human was not going to comply on his own, then he would use
          force and turn the human into his vessel.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he was tired and wounded, he didn't think that a weak bug
          could resist his power and force.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver gasped as he felt the ghost enter into his chest.</p>
        <p>
          He felt a chilling cold sensation on his chest as his breathing
          quickened.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if one were to notice, his reaction remained passive, and his
          expression was unreadable at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>He did not resist at all and let the ghost enter his body.</p>
        <p>It was only after a minute when a shriek sounded out inside him.</p>
        <p>It was a miserable, agonizing shriek of a pig being slaughtered.</p>
        <p>
          "What is this!? This foul thing… how can this be!? Y-You are not
          human!?"
        </p>

        <p>
          The old ghost, who was trying to forcefully possess Oliver a moment
          ago, was now viciously struggling as a strange dark reddish energy
          tried to devour him instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The energy was foul and corrupted, it was not espera but something
          even deadlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver smiled in a saintly way as he innocently asked, "What's the
          matter? Aren't you going to possess me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "SHUT UP! Who are you!? You are not human! AAGH-! It hurts! It hurts!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The old ghost sounded as if he was being tortured alive; his cries
          were agonizing and painful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sighed as he took a look inside, and he saw the reason for
          those shrieks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Abyss energy, which was naturally flowing inside him, had captured
          the ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was slowly eating away the parts of the ghost, limb from limb, and
          as a result of being corrupted by this, the old ghost was experiencing
          the feeling of being skinned alive.
        </p>
        <p>A disturbing energy that could corrupt even the demons.</p>
        <p>
          The Abyss was unfathomable, and the ghost also realized his situation
          painfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had just entered this human in order to possess him, but what he
          was met with was infinite depth, a true darkness with no seeming end.
        </p>
        <p>
          He traveled as much as he could, but he was unable to move past the
          darkness; he could not access the core of this human child.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if he was sinking into an abyss with no finite end.</p>
        <p>
          He felt like drowning, and before he knew it, a sharp pain assaulted
          his very being.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if something was forcefully trying to consume him bit by
          bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old ghost finally experienced the worst pain of his life if he
          could express it.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter how much he tried to resist that force, he could not
          overcome it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was shocked beyond belief; no matter how wounded or weak he was, he
          was still a powerful demonic ghost. How could a mere human child with
          no noticeable power be able to restrict him?
        </p>
        <p>
          This kid was no human! He was something else… something forbidden…
        </p>
        <p>
          And when this realization settled within him, he restlessly adopted
          the only approach that could save his life.
        </p>
        <p>He started begging the human kid to spare him.</p>
