        <h2>Chapter 181 &nbsp;Showing superiority! Dominating the battle!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 181</p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Oliver, who saw the man rushing at him, had a cold
          glint in his eyes as he assumed a quick stance, with one leg stretched
          behind and one hand closely aligned with his chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          His breath steadied, every fiber of his being focused on the impending
          strike.
        </p>
        <p>He lunged forward!</p>
        <p>
          His palm lashed out at a terrifying speed, colliding with the man's
          frenzied charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power of the [Eternal Twelve Lies Palm], previously held back due
          to insufficient espera, now surged forth with full force!
        </p>
        <p>
          The man's eyes widened as his instincts suddenly screamed at him to
          dodge; however, it was already too late. Lost in madness, he could
          only try to defend.
        </p>
        <p>BOOM!</p>
        <p>"Ark-!"</p>
        <p>Swish! Swish! Swish!</p>
        <p>
          The burly man clenched his jaw tightly as his vision suddenly
          darkened. For a moment, he found himself in a dark space all alone
          before twelve illusionary giant figures appeared before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their forms were towering and ominous, each one exuding an aura of
          pure malice. The shadows of the figures loomed large, each one more
          imposing than the last, suffocating him with their sheer presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          His body flared up as the danger reached its peak. He saw all twelve
          of those giants looking down at him before they moved. All of them, in
          unison, struck out their palms in his direction, crushing him from all
          sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their forms remained unwavering; to them, he was nothing more than an
          insect, a mere pest to be crushed by their overwhelming might.
        </p>
        <p>
          "ARGH-!!" The man roared as his eyes turned bloodshot. He exerted his
          body's strength, every muscle contracting as he endured the impact.
        </p>
        <p>BANG!!</p>
        <p>
          The man was thrown backward into the air, crashing far into the
          mountainous rocks!
        </p>
        <p>Spit!</p>

        <p>
          A glob of blood was all he could manage to spit as even the air seemed
          to struggle in his lungs.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind raced, desperately trying to make sense of the overwhelming
          force that had just hit him.
        </p>
        <p>The impact was too powerful!</p>
        <p>
          Even someone as powerful as him was left reeling. He could only
          imagine how brutally his comrades had been vanquished by this kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was no ordinary kid; the two girls from before were nothing in
          front of him. He could tell since he had just suppressed them both.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them was even a light element awakened individual. He could
          understand if she had this much power; however, this boy, who clearly
          had no relation to the light attribute, displayed such power. It
          surprised him.
        </p>
        <p>
          How could someone so young possess such devastating strength? It
          defied all logic.
        </p>
        <p>He was only Rank-1, and the difference was already this much?</p>
        <p>
          Moreover, the boy did not seem too worried from the beginning. It was
          as if he had calculated everything beforehand and their existence was
          not a threat in his mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The realization that they had been underestimated from the start
          gnawed at him, deepening his despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          The burly man gritted his teeth as cracks appeared in the heavy body
          armor he was wearing, which was also an artifact he had been given by
          the sect.
        </p>
        <p>'My artifact broke!? Just how terrifying was this impact…'</p>
        <p>
          His eyes, which were earlier ablaze with fighting spirit, were now
          replaced with a hint of fear and wariness.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an Uncommon-rank artifact, and it was not something that would
          break so easily, given it was a defensive artifact.
        </p>
        <p>For it to break meant that the opponent was too powerful for him.</p>
        <p>But how could this be even possible?</p>
        <p>
          Was it truly power, or was there something more sinister lurking
          behind those strikes?
        </p>
        <p>
          That kid was clearly a Rank-1 exorcist from his espera; he had felt it
          earlier. So how could his artifact break from the impact generated by
          him?
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only imagine what would have happened had he received a
          direct blow from that terrifying palm move.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Fuck! The Mystic Purge Clan are all monsters, even their kids are
          monsters. We should not have messed with them.'
        </p>

        <p>
          He suddenly felt regretful that he had volunteered for this mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their leader was still nowhere to be seen—probably still engaged with
          the expert from outside—and his two comrades had already been
          exorcised, leaving him alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alone and outmatched, the weight of his earlier bravado now felt like
          a death sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not dare imagine what would become of him if he returned to the
          sect empty-handed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not flee; either way, it was a do-or-die situation for him
          too.
        </p>
        <p>'I can only put my life on the line.'</p>
        <p>The burly man slowly rose to his feet, his eyes turning fierce.</p>
        <p>
          "Ancient lords of the darkness, I offer my soul as tribute. Grant me
          strength beyond mortal limits, even if it costs my very essence."
        </p>
        <p>
          The burly man began an incantation in a guttural language, his eyes
          losing their luster until only a void remained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then, a transformation began—his eyes blackened completely, as if
          consumed by darkness itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then that he heard a familiar tapping sound, and there stood
          the white-haired boy, unperturbed, landing in front of him with a
          practiced ease.
        </p>
        <p>"Survived, did you? Impressive."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's lips curled into a smirk. "I was hoping you'd be carrying
          something worthwhile, but it seems you've got nothing but your
          desperation. How... unfortunate."
        </p>
        <p>"So, there's nothing worth taking from you after all."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver mocked as he looked disdainfully at the man who was earlier so
          arrogant but now had all the nerves in his body shriveled up just from
          the impact of the strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mastery of [Eternal Lies Twelve Palms] had indeed not disappointed
          him in the least.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt quite good overpowering an opponent a Rank above him like
          this—it was only possible due to the enemy being hollow inside. These
          heretics only had borrowed strengths from demons, it was not unheard
          of them being exorcised by lower ranking exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          He curled his fingers into a fist as his gaze gradually became colder.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt no pity for the man, only a cold detachment. He did not feel
          any regret or hard feelings when he earlier killed the old heretic. To
          him, they were nothing and had intended to kill him; he simply
          exorcised them from this world.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Your eyes?" Oliver paused, looking the man in his eyes, causing the
          man to take a step back. Under his gaze, the burly man felt as if his
          body was cut open and his soul was present naked before the kid.
        </p>
        <p>"Die!"</p>
        <p>
          Without responding further, the burly man's left hand started to glow
          as dark espera began to gather in his left palm. The tremors in the
          air surrounding the man grew more intense as the dark espera filled
          in.
        </p>
        <p>
          A huge arrow, condensed from dark espera, emerged in the man's hand as
          his eyes turned deadly. He struck forward, intending to sweep Oliver,
          the force behind the attack significantly faster and more powerful
          than what he had shown earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The very ground seemed to shake under the weight of the man's
          desperation-fueled attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver drew out an axe from his mind space and immediately swung it
          forward, a blue streak of light appearing forth, clashing directly
          with the black power.
        </p>
        <p>
          The impact of the dark espera gradually lessened, but it started to
          absorb the water espera that was contained behind that axe strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver twisted his hand and threw the axe toward the man. The rapid
          speed made the man quickly put his hands forward as more of the dark
          espera began to release from his body, blocking the strong axe flying
          forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A Sacrifice of Servitude... You've truly lost all hope." Oliver
          remarked, eyeing the man's grotesque form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man's demonic eyes widened in disbelief as he unintentionally
          asked, "You knew…?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes flashed with a knowing gleam, though he offered no
          explanation. The man, who saw the white-haired boy readying his fist
          again, felt a true sense of fear as he quickly scurried backward,
          stumbling over his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the first time, he realized that death was closer than he had ever
          imagined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes narrowed, and suddenly he leaped off the spot he was
          standing on, like a streak of black light, sweeping across the sky. In
          the blink of an eye, Oliver was in front of the huge man, and the
          wolf-headed demons along the path burst apart sequentially.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sneered and launched his attack before the burly man could even
          react.
        </p>
        <p>Too fast!</p>
        <p>
          The burly man's pupils dilated as he instinctively thrust his palm
          toward Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>"A-AAH!"</p>
        <p>
          Lost in fear and madness, the man lunged at him, throwing a strike at
          him. Oliver dodged and hit the man right in his solar plexus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment of impact was swift, leaving the man breathless and broken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's fist was faster as it punched straight through the burly
          man's abdomen. The terrifying force of the punch continued onward,
          shattering a series of rocky mountains in its path, and the fierce
          winds lifted all the rocks on the cliff into the air.
        </p>
        <p>With a boom!</p>
        <p>
          The azure light curtain in the attack forcefully surrounded the man,
          and together with the overwhelming power of the [Eternal Twelve Lies
          Palm], the man's bones and organs were shattered.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          Another powerful impact, and the man's body went limp as he crashed
          back into the rocks.
        </p>
        <p>"Time to face your exorcism."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 182 &nbsp;Jetia arrives! Oliver's attitude!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 182</p>
        <p>"Your end is now."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's fingers moved in a deliberate gesture, and black flames
          erupted, consuming the man, erasing him from existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sat down on the ground afterward and slowly lay back, heaving
          slightly. His muscles quivered with fatigue, every breath labored, as
          if the battle's weight still lingered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silence that followed was almost surreal, the echoes of the battle
          fading into nothingness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The calm after the storm was unsettling, as though the world itself
          held its breath, waiting for something more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Espera gathered around him as he guided it through his body, filling
          his now depleted reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          He closed his eyes and rested for a bit. A moment of peace in the
          midst of chaos, however brief, was a luxury he rarely afforded
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The battle had been taxing, but the relief of victory was fleeting,
          like a shadow slipping through his fingers. Victory's taste was always
          bitter, laced with a cost that could not be ignored
        </p>
        <p>
          He began gathering espera at a fast pace, thanks to his high talent.
          It would not take long before he was back to his peak again. Yet, the
          urgency to recover quickly gnawed at him; he knew there was no time to
          waste.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as he was settling down, his instincts started to warn him again.
          This time, a very heavy feeling settled on his mind. It was as if the
          air itself had thickened, suffocating under the weight of something
          dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cold shiver ran down his spine, the air thickening with an ominous
          presence that couldn't be ignored.
        </p>
        <p>
          His heart skipped a beat, the instinctual dread creeping into his
          bones like an unwelcome guest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He instantly got up and looked back, his complexion not too great.
        </p>
        <p>'Ah, don't tell me Sigfor did not manage to win?'</p>
        <p>
          His mind raced through the possibilities. The thought of Sigfor's
          defeat didn't just unsettle him—it terrified him.
        </p>
        <p>Sigfor was their anchor; without him, everything could unravel.</p>

        <p>
          The eerie silence was broken only by the faint rustle of leaves in the
          wind, a sound that now seemed far too ominous. Oliver could feel it, a
          disturbance in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          His senses sharpened, picking up the faintest hint of a presence
          approaching—one that was neither friend nor foe, but something else
          entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          He clenched his fists, his body still aching from the previous battle,
          but he knew there would be no time to rest. Rest was a luxury he could
          not afford; survival demanded every ounce of strength he had left.
        </p>
        <p>
          His heart pounded in his chest as he strained to listen, every muscle
          tensing as he prepared for what was to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          If another powerful enemy was approaching, it meant things were far
          more complicated than he had anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The situation was spiraling out of control, and he knew he was running
          out of options.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cursed at the uselessness of the old man; what kind of veteran was
          he, then? A veteran who couldn't win when it mattered most was more of
          a liability than an asset.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes changed colors as the world before him shifted, changing into
          nothing but a transparent detailed view… The familiar sight of his
          enhanced vision brought clarity, but also dread. What he saw confirmed
          his worst fears.
        </p>
        <p>'This…'</p>
        <p>
          He frowned as a swirling mass of black energy drew near their
          location. It was massive—far more massive than any of the heretics
          combined.
        </p>
        <p>He could feel goosebumps just from seeing it closing in.</p>
        <p>'What in the world is that?'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver knew the answer to his question: it was likely that the heretic
          heading their way was the leader of the earlier group of three
          heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not have the confidence to fight against that swirling black
          energy at all. The mere thought of confronting such a force sent a
          chill through his veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to escape with the others before the person arrived. Fighting
          was no longer an option; survival was the only priority now.
        </p>
        <p>Well, escape was the first thing that came to his mind!</p>
        <p>
          'I…' he wondered about possible scenarios he could create to escape.
          His mind raced, calculating every possible route, every possible
          outcome, but each seemed more dire than the last. n/ô/vel/b//in dot
          c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          He still had some cards up his sleeve, confident that he could escape
          if the worst came to the worst, but what about the others? His escape
          might be assured, but abandoning the others was not an option. The
          guilt would be unbearable.
        </p>

        <p>
          His main concern was ensuring the safety of the others. They were the
          future hope of humanity, and he could not let them die in a place like
          this. The burden and responsibilities on his shoulders would be
          immense if he acted alone. The weight of their lives pressed down on
          him, making the air feel even heavier.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait, what if I do that…" Oliver murmured as his eyes shone with a
          clever glint. He walked towards the place where Nadia and Evelyn were
          supposed to be and saw them healing their injuries while meditating.
        </p>
        <p>
          A plan began to take shape in his mind, a risky one, but the only one
          that might work.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I apologize, but what is about to come is too dangerous, and I fear
          that I won't be able to hide my abilities any further in front of the
          entity. So you two must sleep."
        </p>
        <p>
          With a thought, his figure blurred, his speed even faster than what he
          had displayed against the heretics, as he appeared behind the two
          girls stealthily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before they could even realize his presence, a swift blow to their
          necks sent them unconscious. He could not help but feel a little
          awkward; he had used more force than he had anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, he did not know where the pressure point was to knock them
          out, so he could only depend on force to render them senseless.
        </p>
        <p>
          His lack of finesse was regrettable, but there was no time to dwell on
          it.
        </p>
        <p>Fortunately, he was careful enough not to break their necks.</p>
        <p>
          He picked them both up and carried them to where the rest of the group
          was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Laying them in a discreet spot, reddish-black energy started to swirl
          around him as the air seemed to crackle with tension the moment the
          energy was released.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power he unleashed was raw and primal, a force that bent the very
          fabric of space even.
        </p>
        <p>
          He noticed the frown on Evelyn's face and shook his head. The
          reddish-black energy flowed as gently as water despite its chaotic
          nature under his control and slowly enveloped the five of them like a
          big dark cocoon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cocoon of energy was their shield, a fragile barrier between life
          and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing the process, he looked at the dark covering enveloping
          the group and smiled. They should be undetectable for the time being.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small victory in the face of overwhelming odds, but he knew it
          wouldn't last long.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the entrance of the mountain with keen eyes and jumped
          down the rocks, slowly descending.
        </p>
        <p>He could tell the enemy was almost here.</p>

        <p>Creak!</p>
        <p>
          The door to the mountain entrance creaked open, and a tall man with
          long hair entered with calm steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as the man entered, his gaze was locked onto Oliver, examining
          him with interest. The intensity of the man's gaze was unsettling, as
          though he were dissecting Oliver with his eyes alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, feeling the man's gaze, felt an unpleasant sensation spreading
          throughout his body. It was as if the man's very presence was a
          poison, seeping into his veins and clouding his thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you the heir of the Mystic Purge Clan, kid?" the man questioned
          in a calm, unbothered tone.
        </p>
        <p>"State your name."</p>
        <p>
          Hearing Oliver's words, Jetia raised a brow. Why did he feel that the
          kid before him was exceptionally calm and bold?
        </p>
        <p>It did not seem like he feared him at all.</p>
        <p>Did he not realize who he was and the aura behind him?</p>
        <p>
          To make sure he understood, Jetia released a torrent of his dark
          espera, enveloping the entire mountain base in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now tell me, are you the one from the Mystic Purge Clan or not?"
          Jetia asked, this time his tone more overbearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He already knew that the kid was from the Mystic Purge Clan, given his
          white hair shining distinctively, but he wanted to hear it from the
          kid's mouth.
        </p>
        <p>He wanted to crush that arrogance from before.</p>
        <p>
          However, a calm voice rang out again amidst the terrifying pressure.
        </p>
        <p>"Did I stutter?" the voice asked.</p>
        <p>"Introduce yourself."</p>
        <p>
          Jetia's head snapped up to look at Oliver, his eyes showing a
          surprised expression, clearly not expecting him to be able to endure
          his espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          His expression twisted momentarily before he regained his composure.
        </p>
        <p>"I am Jetia, one of the twelve saints of the Unholy Sun Sect."</p>
        <p>
          "You seem quite skilled for a Rank-1 exorcist," Jetia smirked. He
          added, "Now tell me, are you the one?"
        </p>
        <p>"You are not worthy enough to know."</p>
        <p>"You…" Jetia's smile crooked.</p>
        <p>______________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 183 &nbsp;Abyss energy unleashed for the first time!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 183</p>
        <p>
          "Where are my subordinates?" He narrowed his eyes and tried to sense
          their presence, but he could not detect anything. His frustration
          grew, a sharp edge of anxiety creeping into his thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They have been exorcised," Oliver stated calmly, making Jetia pause
          his search. Before the latter could say anything, Oliver added, "You
          don't need to search for them, for you will be joining them soon."
        </p>
        <p>
          Those arrogant words made Jetia look at Oliver as if he were viewing a
          fool. The idea that this boy could defeat his subordinates was
          laughable, and yet… there was something unsettling about the calmness
          in Oliver's tone, a conviction that gnawed at Jetia's confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I didn't know that the heir of the Mystic Purge Clan was this
          delusional. It looks like your clan has finally lost its last working
          screws." Jetia sneered, his voice dripping with disdain. Yet beneath
          the mockery, a flicker of doubt lingered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia's aura intensified as he said, "I don't know how you managed to
          pull off that stunt you claim. But you will soon be answering me for
          everything anyway."
        </p>
        <p>
          A pitch-black shadow emerged from behind Jetia, around 7 feet tall and
          wide. It was like a ghost.
        </p>
        <p>"First, let's capture you."</p>
        <p>
          Jetia looked at Oliver in a sinister fashion and waved his hand as the
          giant ghost behind him moved at tremendous speed, aiming for Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was upon Oliver in the blink of an eye; however, Oliver was
          unfazed. His expression remained unreadable, as if he was merely
          observing an insignificant event.
        </p>
        <p>
          Waving his hand, a huge tide of blue espera crashed against the ghost,
          immediately pushing it back. The clash of energies was explosive,
          sending shockwaves through the air.
        </p>
        <p>"Such espera!"</p>
        <p>
          Jetia's eyes turned keen as he sensed the espera that could not belong
          to a mere Rank-1 at all. He concluded that Oliver was using a
          Unique-rank artifact to conceal his strength and aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, he would have seen through it instantly. The realization
          struck Jetia like a hammer, shaking the certainty he had held moments
          before.
        </p>
        <p>But this revelation only stoked the fire of his curiosity.</p>

        <p>'So the confidence stems from this?'</p>
        <p>
          Jetia laughed to himself; he had not expected such a clever kid. But
          his laughter was hollow, masking the unease brewing within him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, if this was the case, then he might surely have been able to
          exorcise those three together with the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm… I can't sense the auras of the others either?" Jetia looked
          around.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did they really get killed or what?" He grinned and mocked, but the
          confidence in his voice wavered slightly. For the first time, doubt
          began to gnaw at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not respond, which further made Jetia believe this was the
          case.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Such a pity," he shook his head and looked at Oliver. "The clans are
          surely going to go crazy after this. I was planning to slaughter
          everyone on my own, but it seems that my useless subordinates did the
          work for me. Turns out they were not entirely useless after all."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia did not show a hint of care or regret about the fact that his
          heretic subordinates had died, and this was normal. For heretics,
          other than their extreme fanatic intent towards worshipping demons,
          very few things mattered.
        </p>
        <p>
          To him, the loss was negligible, showing the insignificance of the
          three.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Enough yapping," Oliver said in a low tone, his voice cutting through
          Jetia's taunts like a blade through mist.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Since you want to die so badly, then die!" Jetia was really furious;
          this was the third time he had been provoked by Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not take it lying down. Today would become a day where all
          the five major clans would mourn.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fame would skyrocket after he dealt with the last remaining heir!
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia's body suddenly released powerful dark espera, suppressing
          everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          A huge gorilla phantom figure materialized in front of Jetia, as the
          tall ghost from before converged into the phantom. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia's eyes shone with luster as he scornfully looked down at Oliver.
          He spoke, "Behold! Before you die, I will let you witness the true
          might of Jetia, the one this world knows! The sight of victims
          instilled with fear is something I can get drunk on. HAHAHA!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's expression remained unfazed, though a cold glint flashed
          through his eyes. His calm demeanor only seemed to agitate Jetia
          further, the saint's amusement beginning to sour.
        </p>

        <p>"It's a pity…"</p>
        <p>
          Jetia paused as he glanced at the boy looking at him with calm eyes,
          clearly not the expression of someone afraid of death at such a
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          That calmness unsettled him, even if he refused to acknowledge it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver slightly raised his hand, his fingers stretched out as he made
          a waving motion towards Jetia.
        </p>
        <p>"What did you sa—?"</p>
        <p>
          Before Jetia could ask what he wanted, his pupils dilated as an
          overbearing sense of dread enveloped his mind. His instincts literally
          screamed at him to escape; however, it was too late. He did not know
          why or what, but the hand sign Oliver showed made him feel goosebumps
          all over.
        </p>
        <p>
          All he saw was a flash of red streaking towards him at a speed he
          could not keep up with before everything went black.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huff…" Oliver huffed slightly as he retracted his hand. Just that one
          move had consumed almost ninety percent of his Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          His breath was ragged, the exertion taking its toll, yet his
          expression remained steely.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not hesitate to use his trump card instantly, even if the
          opponent before him was a heretic with borrowed strength from demons.
          The gap between the ranks was quite vast.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not know what rank the person was at, but he could not care
          less about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enemy was extremely powerful for his current level. If he had any
          chance to take down the enemy, it was to do so in one attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he had to attack sneakily in a way that the enemy's guard
          was not high; otherwise, there was a chance that the other party could
          defend themselves, which would not have ended well afterward.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he did exactly that. Using more Abyss energy than necessary, he
          channeled and put forth everything in his single attack to strike
          Jetia earlier, intending to finish him off in one move.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one was more aware than himself that using that much of his Abyss
          energy was unnecessary, but he was too cautious and did it anyway in
          the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he had to say, only forty percent would have been enough to defeat
          Jetia, but he had never experimented with it before, so he fumbled
          slightly and used too much.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not to mention, Jetia's move just now gave him too dangerous of a
          feeling, so he did not hesitate to use almost all of it.
        </p>
        <p>Now he was drained of both espera and Abyss energy at the moment.</p>
        <p>
          His espera was still recovering, but his Abyss energy was not, for
          some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          'What's happening?' He frowned and thought for a moment. He had no
          clue how to refill Abyss energy again, nor had he ever needed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          'There must be a special method or technique to gain it back. I will
          have to think about it in the future as soon as this is over.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head tiredly. He did not feel regretful for using all his
          reserves; if someone as strong as Jetia could be killed, then it was
          all worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could feel the weight of exhaustion settling into his bones, but it
          was a small price to pay.
        </p>
        <p>His life was naturally more important than anything.</p>
        <p>"Now what to do?"</p>
        <p>
          He looked ahead, and not even a piece of Jetia remained anymore. The
          Abyss energy had consumed everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only the lingering traces of dark espera gave any indication of the
          battle that had just taken place.
        </p>
        <p>"Well, I am sure they will handle it on their own."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver shook his head and gazed into the distance, his eyes turning a
          strange light for an instant before returning to normal.
        </p>
        <p>"I should go with the others."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver disappeared from his spot, reappearing where a dome of Abyss
          energy was enveloping some kids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Touching the abyssal dome, the Abyss energy retracted back into his
          body as the energy shield disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Making some space, he lay down between them and closed his eyes as
          well. The fatigue of battle finally catching up to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And as he had expected, soon enough, loud thunderous sounds erupted
          all around the mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison, with a bunch of people, stormed inside the mountain hall,
          destroying the barrier and formations in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes were cold as she extended her senses, covering the entire
          mountain in a single breath, her presence as enormous as the mountain
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The individuals beside her were not ordinary either; all of them
          carried an extraordinary presence of their own.
        </p>
        <p>___________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 184 &nbsp;Alison returns!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 184</p>
        <p>
          She was notified the moment the barrier on the mountain was attacked.
          Since she was the one who had set up the barrier, even minute changes
          to it were felt by her.
        </p>
        <p>The subtle shift in the air alerted her like a whisper of danger.</p>
        <p>
          Seeing someone attack the mountain in her absence made her immediately
          return from whatever she was doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her return was swift and purposeful, the urgency clear in her every
          movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, she had gone to fetch Bella back from her training. The
          individuals beside her were the ones who had been responsible for
          helping Bella with her element.
        </p>
        <p>Their presence brought a reassuring strength to the situation.</p>
        <p>
          She knew something was up since Sigfor had not informed her of
          anything. Her instincts, honed by years of experience, told her that
          this was more than a simple disturbance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was most definitely a planned attack targeting the heirs of the
          major clans in her absence. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          The audacity of such a maneuver was not lost on her; it spoke of
          desperation or bold overconfidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where are the kids?" one of the figures asked in a deep voice as he
          headed towards the dorms. His voice carried a note of concern, echoing
          the tension in the air.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm, I sense Sigfor's espera. I will go to him."</p>
        <p>"Teacher…"</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a girl with platinum blonde hair jumped down and approached
          Alison, who had her eyes closed, searching the mountains.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Found them," Alison whispered to herself and vanished from her
          previous spot, appearing in front of a strange sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her brows furrowed as she observed the kids sleeping peacefully before
          her, arranged in a neat row—as if placed intentionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The eerie calmness unsettled her, as if they were part of a larger
          puzzle yet to be solved.
        </p>
        <p>
          She made a hand gesture to see if it was an illusion or trap but found
          none.
        </p>
        <p>
          She walked up to them, and before she could say anything, Oliver
          suddenly jumped up, startling her.
        </p>
        <p>His abrupt movement was a stark contrast to the serene setting.</p>
        <p>
          "Whoa! Where am I!? Huh! Teacher Alison, what are you doing here?"
        </p>
        <p>He looked at Alison with confused eyes and asked cluelessly.</p>
        <p>
          "Before that…" Alison took a deep breath and asked him, "What are you
          all doing here? What exactly happened?" Her tone was gentle but firm,
          seeking the truth amidst the chaos.
        </p>
        <p>"…Ah, about that…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver recounted his experiences quickly, naturally omitting the scene
          where he exorcised the heretics on his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          "…And then a man with a white faceless mask suddenly appeared out of
          nowhere. I thought he was also going to attack us, but instead, he
          knocked all of us out. The last thing I saw was him and the heretics
          being hostile to one another."
        </p>
        <p>
          He paused and watched Alison's reaction keenly. She had a deep frown
          on her face as she pondered his words.
        </p>
        <p>Her mind raced, connecting dots that didn't quite align.</p>
        <p>She couldn't understand how the situation had turned out.</p>
        <p>The layers of the mystery seemed to deepen with each revelation.</p>

        <p>
          A group of heretics decided to target the kids and were then
          intercepted by an unknown man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something was odd about this whole thing that she couldn't quite
          comprehend.
        </p>
        <p>The pieces were scattered, and the picture remained incomplete.</p>
        <p>How could so many people infiltrate through her barrier?</p>
        <p>The breach was not just physical but also a blow to her pride.</p>
        <p>
          "Well, good job. Because of my negligence, you kids had to suffer."
          Her words were tinged with regret, a silent vow to do better.
        </p>
        <p>
          She patted Oliver's head and smiled, while the latter smiled wryly.
        </p>
        <p>"Oliver!"</p>
        <p>
          He suddenly heard a familiar voice and turned to look behind him, only
          to see the girl who was the most sensible among all the kids.
        </p>
        <p>"Bella!? You're back?"</p>
        <p>He waved at her as she came running up to him.</p>
        <p>"What happened? Why are Evelyn and the others lying down?"</p>
        <p>
          She looked worriedly at her sister and the others and went up to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver also followed behind, briefing her about the situation that
          occurred some time ago.
        </p>
        <p>"What… so much happened?"</p>
        <p>
          Bella looked sad as she gently stroked Evelyn's hair, retrieving a
          green shining liquid in a vial and starting to pour it into Evelyn's
          mouth.
        </p>

        <p>"Oliver, help your friends. Here."</p>
        <p>
          Alison handed him a few more tubes of healing potion as she went back
          to gather more details and investigate. She would have to prepare a
          proper explanation for the clans too.
        </p>
        <p>
          She believed it might be possible that the person who rescued the kids
          and dealt with the heretics was someone from the five major clans sent
          undercover to protect them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought of a guardian in disguise was both reassuring and
          intriguing.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Still, if it's someone skilled enough to remain undetected by me,
          then it should be possible for the masked man to be strong enough to
          deal with the heretics alone.'
        </p>
        <p>She wondered what would happen now that this had transpired.</p>
        <p>
          The Unholy Sun Sect could now be considered as good as gone once she
          informed the clans about their deep involvement in this matter related
          to their heirs.
        </p>
        <p>She hoped they would clarify things more properly.</p>
        <p>For now, she needed to see Sigfor and discuss this with him.</p>
        <p>___________</p>
        <p>"Alphonso, you okay?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver asked as he helped him drink the potion. Alphonso slowly opened
          his eyes and sat up against the grass.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I-I… what happened to the heretics?" he asked, looking around
          hurriedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Calm down, they have all been dealt with. Teacher Alison has returned
          with reinforcements too."
        </p>
        <p>His words were a balm to Alphonso's frayed nerves.</p>
        <p>
          He didn't explain about the masked man and other details but simply
          told a few things to temporarily keep him calm from asking more
          questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The color, which had drained from his face earlier, slowly returned as
          he accepted the news with a heavy heart. He could still vividly recall
          the scene of torture in his mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver noted this and decided to later ask Alison to send Alphonso for
          some psychiatric therapy. No matter what, for a child to go through so
          much, it was understandable that their minds would still be unstable.
        </p>
        <p>"Rest well. I'll go wake the others."</p>
        <p>He then woke up Daniel, who started coughing violently.</p>
        <p>_____________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 185 &nbsp;Amber's anger! Finally back to clan!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 185</p>
        <p>
          "Rest well. I'll go wake the others." Oliver's voice carried a gentle
          assurance as he moved to rouse his companions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then woke up Daniel, who started coughing violently. The sound was
          jarring, breaking the calm that had settled momentarily.
        </p>
        <p>"What the fuck! Don't spit on me!"</p>
        <p>Oliver quickly stepped back as Daniel spat everywhere.</p>
        <p>
          "O-Oliver, dude!? What happened!? Where is that poison bastard?"
          Daniel asked angrily as he stood up.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes darted around, still half-caught in the nightmare they'd just
          escaped.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's been exorcised. Teacher Alison has arrived and will handle the
          rest," Oliver calmly briefed the agitated Daniel before turning his
          attention to Amber.
        </p>
        <p>Bella had already woken up Nadia and Evelyn, leaving only Amber.</p>
        <p>
          Each of them bore the marks of their ordeal, but relief washed over
          their faces as they regained consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sister, you must listen to me. They were really powerful!" Evelyn
          chattered non-stop now that she was reunited with her sister. Bella
          listened attentively, gathering details to report back to the clan.
        </p>
        <p>Her sister's words tumbled out, a mixture of fear and excitement.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver slid open the vial and began to slowly pour the potion into
          Amber's mouth as she began to stir awake.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey, Amber…" Oliver's voice was soft, coaxing her back to the waking
          world.
        </p>
        <p>Slap!</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, the group froze as the sound of a slap echoed through the
          surroundings. They all turned toward the source of the sound to see
          Amber looking hatefully at a guy facing away with a red handprint on
          his cheek.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't talk to me, you scum!" Amber yelled in anger, her eyes filled
          with hatred.
        </p>

        <p>The words cut through the air, sharp and unforgiving.</p>
        <p>The air thickened with tension.</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          He touched his cheek where the slap had landed but felt nothing. His
          hand lingered, as if trying to understand the sting that wasn't there.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his toughened body, all he felt was a small itch from the earlier
          impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;The physical pain was absent, but the sting of her words
          remained.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was momentarily stunned before realizing the reason for her
          outburst. It seemed she genuinely believed it was him.
        </p>
        <p>"If you're angry over that then—"</p>
        <p>
          Before Oliver could explain further, Amber stood up and looked down at
          him, repeating, "I. Said. Don't. Talk. To. Me."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, she left the scene, refusing to explain or listen to
          anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Amber, wait!" Alphonso quickly hurried after her, nodding once at the
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;His steps were quick, propelled by a need to mend the rift that
          had formed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver pressed his hand to his forehead, wondering how to handle this
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She…" Nadia narrowed her eyes at Amber's earlier display and was
          about to go teach her a lesson for disrespecting her clan.
        </p>
        <p>Her temper flared, a spark ready to ignite into a blaze.</p>
        <p>
          She was confident Oliver had saved Amber from the heretics, and Amber
          had the nerve to be so ungrateful.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nadia, wait. Don't be impulsive!" Evelyn quickly got in her way,
          explaining how her hasty actions might cause a rift between the two
          major clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Her words were a plea for reason, a shield against escalating
          tensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Either she apologizes, or I throw her to the demons," Nadia stated
          simply yet coldly, troubling Evelyn.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bella sighed as she approached Oliver. Patting his shoulder, she said,
          "Stand up. Let's talk to Teacher Alison."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver also sighed deeply as he stood and followed her out, knowing
          Amber wasn't interested in listening to him. Resignation settled over
          him, a silent acceptance of the path ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was better to leave her alone for now; he didn't have the energy to
          deal with her tantrums.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, he felt that working solo was the right approach for
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, they saw Alison with Sigfor, whose clothes were bloodied and
          riddled with holes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It looked like Sigfor had also suffered while the heretics attacked
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor saw them and quickly rushed over to apologize, and soon the
          matter was resolved. It was decided that everyone would be sent back
          to the clan, and the training would end early.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one objected, and soon their escorts arrived to transport them back
          to the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless, Oliver still felt it was worth it; he was better at using
          the water element and his weapon skills had improved.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, he exchanged pleasantries with the others before leaving.
          There was not much talk between him and Amber, even then.
        </p>
        <p>_________________</p>
        <p>
          Back at the clan, he finally returned to his courtyard after almost a
          year.
        </p>
        <p>"Zippy!"</p>
        <p>He called out as he saw a fat white cat running toward him.</p>
        <p>
          The sight brought a rare smile to his face, a reminder of simpler
          times.
        </p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked down, astonished. The cat had become much fatter than
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This… how did you get so fat?" He turned to his personal maid as if
          to ask her the question.
        </p>

        <p>"Sesha, what have you been feeding her?" he questioned.</p>
        <p>"Meat, young master," she replied in a light tone.</p>
        <p>"Huh? That's it? What about exercise?"</p>
        <p>
          "That…" Sesha's expression turned complicated, "Young master, Zippy
          doesn't like it."
        </p>
        <p>"What?" Oliver had a bewildered expression on his face.</p>
        <p>
          "You…" He looked down at the fat cat rolling at his feet lazily and
          picked it up with some effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Meow…" The cat's soft protest was half-hearted, as if resigned to its
          fate.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you want to eat meat?" he asked.</p>
        <p>"Meow!" the cat eagerly nodded.</p>
        <p>
          Zippy nodded but suddenly paused. A glimmer of suspicion flickered in
          her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Wait a moment! Something doesn't seem right...</p>
        <p>
          Despite being away from Oliver for almost a year, she still knew him
          better than others.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he asked in such a sweet tone that sounded too good to be true,
          it was usually a trap!
        </p>
        <p>Zippy suddenly became alert and vigorously shook her head.</p>
        <p>"Oh? You don't want meat? How can that be?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver smiled darkly as the cat attempted to escape, but his grip was
          too strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          "From now on, you will be on a strict diet. You will also exercise
          daily to get back into a shape that resembles a cat instead of a
          potato."
        </p>
        <p>
          His words were firm, a decree of tough love. Like a thunderbolt, his
          words struck the cat deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zippy sweated upon hearing his words, not daring to imagine life
          without meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          But looking at Oliver's stern expression, she knew there was no scope
          to argue or emotionally blackmail him.
        </p>
        <p>"Sesha, take this fat log for some exercise."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver quickly found an excuse to save himself from Sesha's scrutiny
          and told her to take the clan guardian away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll do as you say, young master." Sesha nodded and carried the
          despairing fat cat away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then... it's been a long time since I met Jenna. I should go see
          her. It's about time I paid some attention to the matters of the
          organization I joined long ago."

          organization I joined long ago."
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes turned serious as he contemplated his next course of action.
          Earlier, he had been hesitant to make a move, but now he felt
          confident in his abilities to act.
        </p>
        <p>
          He needed to restore his abyss energy, and for that, he would have to
          venture outside the clan. He might as well seek Jenna's assistance in
          the meantime.
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>"So... you have finally decided to show up?"</p>
        <p>
          In a luxurious room, a woman with great curves sat cross-legged, her
          arms folded under her ample chest as she looked at the little boy who
          had grown since the last time she saw him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw her piercing eyes and shook his head. She was as strong as
          ever; her espera glowed like a miniature sun, as vast as a mountain.
          The sheer intensity of her aura pressed down on him, like standing in
          the shadow of a giant.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was probably on par with Alison or even stronger than her, at
          least in terms of espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;This observation stirred a mix of respect and caution in Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was always curious what such a person was doing in the Mystic Purge
          Clan and how they had allowed such a powerful outsider to remain with
          them for so long. Did she act behind the scenes?
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna noticed his blank expression and smirked. She had naturally been
          informed by her subordinates about his departure and untimely return.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Her smirk was a knowing one, reflecting the information she had
          gleaned about recent events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a bit of digging allowed her to learn some interesting details
          about how he and the other heirs from the major clans had clashed with
          the heretics of the Unholy Sun Sect.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Why would heretics from the Unholy Sun Sect target you kids? As far
          as I know, they aren't ones to actively seek death by offending five
          major clans at once." Her question hung in the air, demanding an
          answer Oliver wasn't sure he had.
        </p>
        <p>
          She stroked her chin as she asked him with keen eyes, "There must be
          something they desperately wanted from you kids. Hmm?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was secretly impressed by her sharp intuition. To be able to
          deduce such a thing among so many possibilities, he had to admire her
          ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna looked at him for a moment before letting out a mysterious
          smile. "Intuition, maybe?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haha..." Oliver laughed nervously. "Perhaps. I'm not sure of their
          plans either way."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is that so?" She raised a brow at his behavior and leaned back in her
          chair.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Putting that aside, are you interested in improving your rank within
          the organization now?" She picked up a document as she asked him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's right. I was hoping to leave the clan for a while and focus on
          my position, starting now," he nodded. His voice was steady, masking
          the inner turmoil of his decision.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why the sudden interest?" she asked without looking up. Her tone was
          casual, but Oliver sensed the underlying curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I just feel that being in the clan won't benefit me at the
          moment. Despite being allocated resources, it feels like it's not
          enough right now."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you think so? After all, we're talking about one of the five major
          clans. You could try to improve your clan rank too. With the resources
          and natural advantage you have as an heir, you're bound to grow
          stronger either way."
        </p>
        <p>Jenna said as she flipped through the documents one by one.</p>
        <p>
          "Ah, well, I feel more inclined toward this right now, so I want to
          proceed with that." Oliver didn't explain much and simply told her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna finally put down the documents on her desk and looked at him
          seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't mind. As your superior, I should normally be encouraging you
          to take missions. However, your circumstances are special, and that's
          why I need proper clarifications beforehand. But since you've made up
          your mind, I won't stop you."
        </p>

        <p>
          She paused, observing him intently. Her piercing stare made him twitch
          slightly in his seat, as if she was boring a hole through him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You seem to have undergone significant changes as well. Suddenly
          gaining such a large amount of espera despite being born 'talentless.'
          You seem to have quite deep secrets," she judged.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We all have our secrets, don't we?" Oliver retorted playfully, making
          her raise a brow.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed. We all do," she said with a bewitching smile as she leaned
          forward. "But not all of us have the strength to protect those
          secrets..."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked her in the eyes, trying to understand the meaning behind
          her enigmatic words, but alas, she concealed herself too well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Anyway, I'll brief you about the system in the Black Codex
          Federation."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Black Codex Federation is a vast organization, with its influence
          and power on par with a major clan of its own. It operates from
          various places, having branches in almost all cities or towns of the
          human territory. Not only that, its influence extends into the demon
          world as well."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The organization has resources that exorcists would die for, and with
          resources, the organization naturally has wealth unlike any other. We
          can even boast of having wealth greater than some clans."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Climbing higher in the organization would naturally provide you with
          the corresponding benefits and incentives. The organizational ranking
          is pretty simple. It starts from the 'Baron' rank and moves up to the
          'Emperor' rank. Pretty simple, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver interrupted her and asked, "So, the organization follows the
          basic aristocratic rank system for their members?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, you got that right. The greater your rank, the more power you
          can exercise and the more benefits you will enjoy," she nodded.
        </p>
        <p>"What benefits, for example?" he wondered.</p>
        <p>
          "Well, there are plenty of them. For example, the hierarchy in the
          organization is quite strict, and you must listen to your superiors,
          those with a higher rank than you. You will have the power to command
          and mobilize those below you in rank. The bases we have all over the
          world will likewise function in the same manner; the higher your rank
          at that base, the more control you have."

        <p>Creator's Thought</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Chapter 187 &nbsp;Jenna's motive! Why is she in the clan?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 187</p>
        <p>
          "Not only that, but as exorcists grow in rank, it becomes increasingly
          difficult for them to rise to higher ranks and build a foundation for
          each rank. You'll see how the ratio of growth is exponential compared
          to the rate of resources you'll need. And all of these resources can
          be accessed through the organization."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna stood up from her chair and walked up to the window. Looking
          outside, she could see the bustling clan market. Her eyes scanned the
          crowd, taking in the chaos of merchants haggling, customers bartering,
          and the distant hum of chatter that filled the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course, you're under me, so you will naturally receive some level
          of protection too, but that's it. Unless you raise your rank on your
          own, there's not much you'll be able to do."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The Black Codex Federation has its own web, as you might have seen.
          That web is very important, and you can do most things through it
          alone."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You might not know, but we don't often deal in Neden. Instead, we
          have our own established currency called 'credits,' which is the only
          thing you can use to get resources for yourself. You can earn them by
          completing specific missions that are also accessible on the Codex
          Web."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Lastly, to raise your rank within the organization, you can undergo a
          rank-raising mission. These are usually much harder than normal
          missions and are issued only on special request. Of course, to prevent
          members from abusing the system, the whole system is monitored by an
          AI, and there are penalties for not completing the mission. Ah, you
          must not know about AI, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna suddenly paused. Her reflection in the window, faint but
          visible, showed a brief flicker of realization. "It seems I was too
          engrossed in explaining that I forgot about your age. Well, it doesn't
          matter much; you can ignore that part. Other than that, you should
          have gotten an idea about the basic system?"
        </p>
        <p>"Don't worry, I understood it well."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded in understanding. He could fully grasp what she had
          said, and his mind was filled with all sorts of knowledge he could
          remember from the novel as well.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm. So it's like this."</p>

        <p>
          Jenna narrowed her eyes and didn't say much. She walked behind him and
          patted his shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait here for some time. Let me get you your first mission and some
          equipment you might need."
        </p>
        <p>
          Before she left, Jenna smiled. "Also, don't touch my things, or I will
          be mad."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver shivered when he saw her smile; she smiled like a fox. A
          playful threat, but one that carried an edge sharp enough to cut.
        </p>
        <p>With that, she soon left, leaving Oliver alone.</p>
        <p>
          "Haah…" Oliver exhaled lightly and went on to sit in her plush leather
          chair, bouncing on it for a bit. The leather creaked softly under his
          weight, molding to his form as if welcoming him. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>"What material is this chair made of? So comfortable!"</p>
        <p>
          He enjoyed the feeling of the cushion as he rummaged through her desk
          with interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each drawer slid open smoothly, revealing an assortment of neatly
          arranged documents, pens, and other paraphernalia.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, if she had told him not to do it, then he had to do
          it—otherwise, he wouldn't be himself.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm? What is this?"</p>
        <p>
          He picked up an old black pocket diary and fiddled with it before
          opening its pages. Unexpectedly, all the pages were blank.
        </p>

        <p>"A blank diary?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at it. The diary looked used, and it was quite clear
          that the woman was using it regularly; however, it was completely
          blank.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cover was worn, edges frayed, yet the pages inside were eerily
          pristine.
        </p>
        <p>Could it be a coincidence?</p>
        <p>
          With the knowledge of countless novels, he could claim with one
          hundred percent certainty that this was definitely not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next moment, his eyes glowed with a strange light as the world
          before him burst into countless colors, becoming more defined. Things
          that were hidden were revealed as he glanced around.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air seemed to shimmer, layers of reality peeling back to reveal
          hidden depths.
        </p>
        <p>He could not help but exclaim secretly as he observed the room.</p>
        <p>
          This woman had modeled the whole room with countless hidden weapons!
        </p>
        <p>
          This was less of a room and more of a huge, dangerous weapon ready to
          be deployed!
        </p>
        <p>What sort of plans was she concocting in this clan market?</p>
        <p>
          If the clan were to know about this room filled with all sorts of
          dangerous weapons, concealing exorbitant quantities of espera inside,
          they would definitely not let this slide.
        </p>

        <p>
          This was akin to a kingdom hosting weapons of mass destruction from
          another kingdom within their territories; they could be activated
          anytime and cause an unprecedented amount of damage!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's pulse quickened as he imagined the catastrophic potential
          lurking within these walls.
        </p>
        <p>Too risky!</p>
        <p>This woman would be really screwed if this got out somehow.</p>
        <p>
          Well, he didn't have any plans to snitch anyway; he was just surprised
          to see her so well equipped.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but he could spot multiple hidden entries and
          passageways extending to various places in this room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind the bookshelf, under the desk, beside the couch, beneath the
          lamp… The room was a labyrinth of secrets, each hidden door leading to
          who-knows-where.
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head and looked back down at the diary in his hand.</p>
        <p>
          He couldn't help but smile as text started to become visible on the
          previously blank pages.
        </p>
        <p>'So, she was using special ink.'</p>
        <p>
          He started to read the contents, hoping to learn something about
          Jenna.
        </p>
        <p>But as he read more and more, his brows furrowed deeply.</p>
        <p>The content seemed to be deeper than he had expected.</p>
        <p>Flap!</p>
        <p>
          He closed the diary and took a deep breath. Closing his eyes for a
          moment, he thought about what he had read.
        </p>
        <p>"Her purpose is this deep…"</p>
        <p>
          He couldn't help but say to himself as he put the diary back in its
          place and returned to his seat.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turned out that Jenna's background was far from simple. She had
          come to the clan with the purpose of 'revenge.'
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 188 &nbsp;Jenna's cruel past</h2>
        <p>Chapter 188</p>
        <p>
          It turned out that Jenna's background was far from simple. She had
          come to the clan with the purpose of 'revenge.'
        </p>
        <p>
          From the diary he had read, although brief, he realized some
          significant things about her life. It seemed that the diary was a
          record of important events in her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had noted down some points that he had quickly read all at once,
          thanks to his special eyes. The speed at which he read was
          extraordinary as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Originally, Jenna belonged to a small clan deep in the mountains
          called the Ashen Rose Clan, an unknown, small clan hidden deep in the
          mountains. The clan was nestled in a valley, surrounded by towering
          peaks and dense forests, cut off from the rest of the world. It could
          be said that it was not a widely known clan, just a small,
          insignificant one.
        </p>
        <p>However, things changed shortly after.</p>
        <p>
          Out of nowhere, the peaceful clan was suddenly attacked by a group of
          deadly assassins.
        </p>
        <p>
          The night was dark, with no moon to illuminate the village. The only
          light came from the torches the assassins carried as they descended
          upon the clan as it was described in the diary…
        </p>
        <p>
          What followed next was a deadly massacre of the innocent people of the
          Ashen Rose Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Screams echoed through the night, cut short by the swift, merciless
          strikes of the assassins. Blood soaked the earth, turning the once
          peaceful village into a scene of horror.
        </p>
        <p>People who did not know why they were being killed.</p>

        <p>Who killed them.</p>
        <p>And whether their deaths were in vain or not.</p>
        <p>
          It was a cruel scene of torture that enveloped the entire clan. It was
          heart-wrenching for the members of the small clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mothers clutched their children, trying to shield them from the
          violence, but there was no escape. The assassins showed no mercy,
          their blades cutting down everyone in their path.
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn't have resources people would be envious of, they hadn't
          offended any superior powers; they were just living their daily lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan head of the Ashen Rose Clan was a peaceful woman who never
          involved the clan or herself in greater human politics—always
          maintaining a neutral stance.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, they still always aided in the war against the demons. It
          could be said that the clan was one of the few that adopted principles
          of selflessness even in the cruel modern world, without seeking any
          benefits or advantages for themselves.
        </p>
        <p>Yet they suffered such a cruel and horrible fate of annihilation.</p>
        <p>
          Even the children were not spared. Their cries for help were swallowed
          by the chaos, their lives snuffed out before they had a chance to
          understand what was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          The children were not spared by the onslaught of the unknown deadly
          assassins; it was severe.
        </p>

          They tried to fight back but were proven helpless against a mere group
          of assassins. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna Sullivan was the sole survivor of the Ashen Rose Clan, the only
          person who managed to escape the slaughter and survive.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had hidden in a small underground chamber, one only she knew
          about. As she listened to the carnage above, her heart hardened with
          every scream that reached her ears.
        </p>

        <p>
          For reasons unknown to Oliver, she somehow managed to avoid that day
          of slaughter where all of her clanfolk were mercilessly killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not mentioned in her diary either why she managed to escape the
          calamity that day, but one thing was clear:
        </p>
        <p>
          She had vowed on that day to never live in peace until she avenged her
          people, until she hunted down the one responsible for it all, the
          source of it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tears she shed were the last she allowed herself, sealing away her
          grief to fuel her desire for vengeance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not know how she got to where she was now, but one thing
          was crystal clear:
        </p>
        <p>Her purpose here was 'revenge.'</p>
        <p>And the perpetrator who orchestrated this whole ordeal?</p>
        <p>The one Jenna had her sights set on?</p>
        <p>One of the four supreme elders of the Mystic Purge Clan…</p>
        <p>
          One of the founding pillars who had been there as long as the clan had
          existed.
        </p>
        <p>Her target was that individual!</p>
        <p>The sheer audacity of it left Oliver momentarily speechless.</p>

        <p>Such audacity, yet such will…</p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt a stir in his heart; this was no trivial matter after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the supreme elders of the Mystic Purge Clan was a being in a
          realm where most exorcists could only dream of reaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          A realm so powerful that every exorcist would dream of it more than
          once.
        </p>
        <p>And Jenna wanted revenge against someone like that?</p>
        <p>Oliver doubted whether or not she was capable of this.</p>
        <p>
          Not only was the supreme elder an existence countless people looked up
          to, but besides their individual strength, they also led their own
          factions, which were rumored to be just as extraordinary as their
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          A figure of immense power, surrounded by loyal followers who would lay
          down their lives at a mere command.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could be seen from the group of assassins, who most likely belonged
          to the supreme elder, that they had managed to wipe out a small clan
          effortlessly—the clan in question being the Ashen Rose Clan,
          naturally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna wanted revenge against one such supreme elder of the Mystic
          Purge Clan, which meant she required strength equal to or greater than
          that of the supreme elder and likely influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't doubt her influence, considering how she was able to recruit
          him into the Black Codex Federation—this was enough proof that she was
          a higher-up in the organization.
        </p>
        <p>However, he couldn't help but wonder if that was enough.</p>
        <p>In the end, what mattered most was individual strength.</p>
        <p>
          He didn't care about her affairs. As for worrying about a growing plot
          against his clan?
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Mystic Purge Clan were weak enough to fear or be threatened by
          someone's revenge, then it would have ceased to exist long ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mystic Purge Clan had countless enemies, both human and demon;
          they were not weak enough to be shaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, there was something about Jenna's resolve that made him pause. A
          woman who had survived such horror, who had built herself up from
          nothing, was not to be underestimated.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Chapter 189 &nbsp;Visit a normal human city?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 189</p>
        <p>
          In fact, Oliver was in quite a dilemma regarding this situation. He
          did not know whether the clan had intentionally allowed Jenna—someone
          bearing a seed of revenge in her heart against the clan—or if she had
          truly managed to bypass the clan's detection using her skills and
          wits.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it was the latter, then she was truly a dangerous woman who should
          not be offended unless necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her ambition was as vast as the sky itself, her resolve as unyielding
          as the mountains that once sheltered her clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was hard to believe that the sole survivor of a clan that had gone
          extinct decades or perhaps even centuries ago was now plotting revenge
          against one of the supreme elders of one of the five major clans in
          this world.
        </p>
        <p>It was simply inconceivable and bold.</p>
        <p>
          He did not know who would emerge victorious in the end. In the novel,
          there were no mentions of the Ashen Rose Clan or the higher politics
          of the Mystic Purge Clan either.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not unheard of for small unruly clans to offend major powers
          and get wiped out overnight or be invaded by demons and declared
          heretical.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was simply a matter of time to see who would emerge victorious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Would it be the power reigning at the top of the Mystic Purge Clan, or
          would it be a girl from an unknown clan that once existed?
        </p>

        <p>___________</p>
        <p>"Did you touch anything?"</p>
        <p>
          Jenna asked, her voice low and edged with suspicion, looking down at
          Oliver suspiciously, who quickly shook his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm…" Jenna merely hummed, then went back to sit on her chair,
          crossing her legs arrogantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The confident way she carried herself, the casual arrogance in her
          posture, made Oliver feel as though she owned the entire room—and
          perhaps, in a way, she did.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the arrogant woman in front of him, Oliver felt speechless;
          she really knew how to be overbearing if anything.
        </p>
        <p>Anyway, he had nothing to do with it.</p>
        <p>"Did you get it?" he asked curiously.</p>
        <p>"Here it is."</p>
        <p>
          She slid a paper toward him. The document seemed ordinary, but the
          weight of what it represented made Oliver's pulse quicken. But before
          he could pick it up, she said:
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now that you have finally stepped into the realm of exorcism as a
          Rank-1, have you thought of the meditation technique you will be
          using?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "About that…" Oliver paused as the words rang in his mind. He knew
          what she was talking about.
        </p>

        <p>An espera meditation technique!</p>
        <p>
          A technique exorcists use to develop and grow their espera as they
          climb through the ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, he had never paid much attention to such a thing. With the
          system, he had the privilege of being exempted from the hard work of
          meditating for countless hours to develop his espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          All he had to do was wait for his target to achieve a milestone, and
          then he could naturally obtain tenfold benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he still had to choose one on the surface; otherwise, he would not
          be able to justify his growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "About that, I have been given the clan's secret manual," he replied
          with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna nodded. The Mystic Purge Clan's secret manual was extremely
          refined and potent, having been improved over centuries by countless
          expert exorcists. It was a technique exclusive to pure-blooded members
          of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>It was no surprise that he was given one to train with…</p>
        <p>
          "That's great. I was initially thinking of giving you the one I have
          been using, but the Mystic Purge Clan's technique is indeed more
          suitable for your bloodline," she said thoughtfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh?" Oliver was interested but didn't say anything. He knew that
          while a technique was essential, it wasn't the be-all and end-all. A
          technique was merely a means to bring out an individual's talent. If
          you were not born talented, then even if you had the best technique,
          it would be useless and wasted.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was important but not too much for an exorcist. Other things
          mattered as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          He picked up the paper containing the details of the mission he would
          be undergoing for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh? You want me to go to a normal human city?" n/o/vel/b//in dot
          c//om
        </p>
        <p>He couldn't help but exclaim as he read the details on the paper.</p>
        <p>
          "Indeed. It is as you can see in the mission details," she replied
          calmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw this and looked at the paper he was holding, his eyes
          narrowing as they scanned through every single detail mentioned in the
          well-written document.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mission was related to a normal human city, more specifically a
          suspected cursed playground.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was located in the city of Harlington, on the western human
          continent, far from the battlefield.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the mission, there was an old playground that had
          recently become the center of a series of disturbing incidents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Children who played there had been experiencing nightmares, sudden
          illnesses, and strange behavioral changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the information the organization had, it was most likely a signal
          that a dark artifact had been born in that area and had slowly started
          to inflict dark espera on the normal human area.
        </p>
        <p>His goal was simple: to find the artifact and bring it back.</p>
        <p>
          Depending on the rank of the artifact, he might even receive a ton of
          credits on his first mission. More importantly, as a newbie in the
          organization, it was crucial how impactful his first mission turned
          out to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might very well determine his reputation in the Black Codex
          Federation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I understand the specifics of the mission, but you know that my main
          issue is not that, don't you?" Oliver put the paper down and looked at
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing his serious expression, Jenna had a playful smile on her face.
          Her eyes sparkled with amusement, as if she found his concern
          charming.
        </p>
        <p>
          She still found it funny that the person talking to her so casually
          was still a kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He doesn't even realize who I am, or I wonder if he would still be
          able to remain so casual…'
        </p>

        <h2>

        <p>
          'He doesn't even realize who I am, or I wonder if he would still be
          able to remain so casual…'
        </p>
        <p>
          She mused as she replied, "I am aware of that. Don't worry, I selected
          that mission with that in mind. Your main concern is to leave the
          clan, right?"
        </p>
        <p>Oliver nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry, I have arranged for you to be issued a clan mission in a
          nearby city. It should be fine," she said, tilting her head slightly.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver sucked in a deep breath as he heard her.</p>
        <p>
          She had already installed moles in the clan at a high enough position
          to influence the missions assigned.
        </p>
        <p>What a terrifying woman!</p>
        <p>
          "You have taken deep roots in the clan. Are you sure about it?" he
          asked, genuinely wondering what was in her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you worried about your boss?" she smiled and asked in return.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm… maybe?" He put on a thoughtful expression. If she were exposed
          and caught, would he also not be in trouble for colluding with her and
          joining another organization while still being in the clan and
          enjoying its resources?
        </p>
        <p>He could be said to be worried about her in that way!</p>

        <p>
          "Aw, what a cute little boy." Jenna smiled in a way that wasn't quite
          a smile; her tone was sarcastic as she narrowed her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But you don't need to be concerned about me. The game I am playing is
          indeed dreadful, but I am quite the experienced player."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is that so? Good for you. Don't draw too much attention, or I will
          also be in trouble," Oliver scoffed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Humph, you little brat. Care about yourself. With that overflowing
          espera, you better find a way to conceal it, or you might be in more
          trouble." Jenna arrogantly crossed her arms below her chest and said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her aura turned more domineering by the moment, filling the room with
          an invisible pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will see to that," Oliver smirked. "Thanks for the mission,
          'boss'."
        </p>
        <p>He soon left her office and went back to his courtyard.</p>
        <p>
          He had just arrived, and now he would be leaving soon. He was starting
          to get busier from this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spotted a familiar fat cat lazing on top of his couch, snoring as
          it dozed off.
        </p>
        <p>'She probably ditched Sesha…'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver shook his head as he thought about it. How could a mere maid
          contain the clan guardian, no matter how dumb the latter was?
        </p>
        <p>
          He ignored the snoring cat and went to the secret spot behind his
          courtyard. It had been a while since he visited there.
        </p>
        <p>
          He scanned through his belongings in the mindspace and retrieved the
          storage bracelet of the demonic ghost.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that he was in the clan, he didn't fear getting tracked down by
          other heretics. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, it's locked by a rune. I should have asked Sigfor to teach me how
          to break them."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver groaned as he smashed the bracelet on the ground.</p>
        <p>
          "Maybe I should ask for help from an elder knowledgeable about runes?
          I doubt they will just dismiss me as before…"
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered if he should use the clan's help in decoding the runes. He
          knew that the old ghost's storage bracelet had advanced protection
          runes embedded in it, so it would not be easy to decode it with just
          basic rune knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would need to obtain more advanced techniques and knowledge about
          runes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a pity Evelyn has yet to enter the stage where she would start
          getting interested in runic studies, so I won't be getting
          rune-ability-related rewards anytime soon. The only one I can depend
          on is myself," he said in a hushed tone.
        </p>
        <p>It was then that suddenly something happened.</p>
        <p>
          [Ding! Target has learned the 1st level of divine sword arts after
          undergoing rigorous training. Achieved mastery in arts belonging to

        </p>
        <p>[Abyssal Arts Obtained…]</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a huge flood of information burst forth into his mind as if
          someone had opened a door to a new world for him. His eyes widened
          slightly as his mind jolted with pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ugh…" He groaned slightly as he gently touched his forehead,
          organizing his thoughts.
        </p>

        <p>
          As more and more information entered his mind, a change seemed to be
          taking place. His eyes turned more and more blank, as if he were
          undergoing a transformation.
        </p>
        <p>"...Ah."</p>
        <p>
          He let out a sound without a certain meaning behind it, as if he were
          in a trance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took a moment for him to snap back to reality, but when he did, his
          facial expression became complicated, and his eyes narrowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, that's how I need to grow back Abyss energy..." he said to
          himself, looking down at his palm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reward he had obtained this time was knowledge about arts from the
          Abyss and how he needed to grow back his Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently, it was a method that went beyond the scope of any morals
          and ethics he had learned about.
        </p>
        <p>The heart.</p>
        <p>An organ that functions as the source of life in any being.</p>
        <p>A source of life and vitality…</p>
        <p>
          A heart was not limited to the normal heart that humans had; it was
          the core that facilitated life in creatures.
        </p>
        <p>What does a heart have to do with anything here?</p>
        <p>
          One might think that, but in fact, from the information he had
          received, the heart was the only thing that could help him regrow the
          empty reserves of Abyss energy back to how they were.
        </p>
        <p>
          In essence, what he would require would be the heart—the core of life
          that makes a creature functional and alive—for him to be able to
          restore and grow his Abyss to greater heights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the thought of using somebody's heart made him feel sick to his
          stomach.
        </p>
        <p>
          But after calming down, he realized that he should have expected such
          a sinister thing to appear when he had chosen the path of the Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the other information about Abyss arts that he had
          received in exchange for the divine swordsmanship... that was just as
          sinister.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Path of the Abyss was not laid with flowers, unlike the Path of
          Divinity; it was a path filled with thorns and corpses.
        </p>
        <p>Now onto the Abyssal arts...</p>
