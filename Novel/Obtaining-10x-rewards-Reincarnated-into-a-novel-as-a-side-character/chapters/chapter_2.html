        <h2>
          Chapter 21: Exorcist Ranks! Visiting Clan Market for the first time.
        </h2>
        <p>Chapter 21</p>
        <p>"Should we wait for some more time for him to stabilize?"</p>
        <p>
          "We can, but looking at him, I doubt there would be any difference. I
          can sense his body and mind have healed perfectly..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then what should we do? We have already used an elixir, but if we
          don't dig out the source of this all then we could not prevent such
          events in the future?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm. For now, tighten the security of the young master's courtyard.
          Order the guards to be vigilant at all times and not leave him alone
          even if he asks so. Dispatch a team of investigators to find clues,
          and one of you go and check the barrier to see if there's something
          wrong with it."
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder paused, looking at the 2nd young master, he further added,
          "Explain what happened to him and see if there's any reaction."
        </p>
        <p>With that, he left in a hurry, confusing the others.</p>
        <p>
          After coming out of the room, he stroked his chin as he looked at the
          surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>He wondered to himself in a somewhat serious manner.</p>
        <p>
          'What's going on...? A healing elixir is something that can bring back
          a person from the brink of death, but why was he not able to remember
          what happened? How can an elixir be ineffective...'
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder pondered for some time, he had a bad premonition about
          something, some days ago, the clan elites sensed a strange and ominous
          phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was so disturbing that the respected clan guardian personally went
          to check on it which clearly meant that it was dangerous enough to be
          harmful to them...
        </p>

        <p>
          But then a few minutes later, the strange phenomena suddenly vanished
          as if it never existed in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian also did not say anything much on the topic and
          asked everyone to ignore it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many of the clan members were unsettled by this and wanted to
          investigate it further.
        </p>
        <p>However, no one wanted to oppose the guardian.</p>
        <p>
          After the clan head and their wife, the clan guardian held the highest
          authority.
        </p>
        <p>
          She has been overseeing the clan since ancient times, she's powerful
          and has incomprehensible powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          They did not doubt that she could not handle the strange phenomenon
          but for her to not discuss a word about it with any of them made the
          elites restless.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now this happened with the 2nd young master, something that cannot
          even be healed with a healing elixir!
        </p>
        <p>"This is making me feel stressed..."</p>
        <p>
          He muttered, as he pondered his actions, now that someone from the
          clan was affected by something unknown, he can probably no longer obey
          the clan guardian.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I would need to discuss it with others and do something, the clan
          guardian must not know about this otherwise it would be a direct
          challenge to her."
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to do it, a power that can even defy the effects of elixir was
          not something one would see commonly... it was a sign of something big
          happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes shone and with a flick of his finger, he disappeared from the
          courtyard.
        </p>

        <p>______________</p>
        <p>A few weeks later</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was in his courtyard lifting weights, not only that, in the
          back of his house, there were many equipment machines for physical
          exercise and strength training.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had requested the clan to provide him with these, they were just
          ordinary gym equipment he could think of from his previous world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This new world and his last world were quite similar in many things,
          this world was advanced in some aspects as well backward in other
          aspects compared to his last world.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was holding the weights in one hand while in his other hand, he was
          carrying a notebook with some notes scribbled on its neat white pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The power ranking system in this world is exactly as I remember it to
          be from the novel."
        </p>
        <p>He flipped a page as he scanned through the contents.</p>
        <p>
          "Exorcists are majorly categorized based on some crucial factors such
          as their espera level, combat skills, and purification techniques.
          Apart from that, there are factors like formal training and field
          experience that are given in specialized academies."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver put the weights in his hand down as he read further.</p>
        <p>
          "Exorcists could also be broadly classified into 3 categories, first
          are those who rely on their espera, second are the ones who rely on
          their physical powers, and third are the ones who rely on artifacts
          and tools."
        </p>
        <p>He closed the notebook as he changed his clothes.</p>
        <p>"For now, I need to quickly rise through the ranks..."</p>

        <p>The exorcists are ranked into 7 levels.</p>
        <p>Rank 1 to Rank 7</p>
        <p>
          Rank 1 being considered the newcomers to the exorcist world, just
          beginning their training and having a basic amount of knowledge about
          spiritual combat and purification techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          These exorcists have no particular exorcism style and typically work
          under the high-ranking exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rank 2 being the next step as they solidify their foundations on
          purification techniques and combat styles, they usually undergo
          rigorous training and this stage has always been considered tough for
          beginners. They can handle minor demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rank 3 exorcists are one step ahead, able to operate independently
          without the supervision of a high-ranking exorcist and handle low to
          mid-level demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rank 4 exorcists are even more advanced, capable of dealing with
          high-ranking demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rank 5 level exorcists are in charge of leading other exorcists in
          wars, missions, and dealing with catastrophic demons.
        </p>
        <p>The later level exorcists are legendary beings.</p>
        <p>
          It was rumored that the clan heads of the 5 clans belong to these
          stages... of course, it's unknown how these levels operate and how
          many of such exorcists exist.
        </p>
        <p>Creak!</p>
        <p>
          "Zippy, I am going out to the market... I will bring you some meat."
        </p>
        <p>"Meow!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver announced and left the courtyard, he had some things he wanted
          to purchase from the clan's market.
        </p>
        <p>His goal was quite simple.</p>
        <p>
          It was to use his special eyes to cheat through the market; in the
          novels he used to read, he was always fascinated by the protagonists
          who had special abilities to distinguish treasures among trash.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that he had such means himself, there was no way he was going to
          be passing on such an opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a great opportunity to collect some rare artifact to further
          ensure his future and if possible, look for something to fasten
          Nadia's growth as well.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 22: How the clan market works?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 22</p>
        <p>
          He knew that there was no lack of treasures in this world; there were
          many things that were wasted or left unnoticed throughout the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wouldn't be a problem if he could find them and use them for his
          own benefits. He was inherently weak, and obtaining tools and
          artifacts should ensure his future safety.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't even think about giving them to Nadia.</p>
        <p>It was more like he can't give them to her even if he wanted to.</p>
        <p>The reason was simple yet had a complex explanation...</p>
        <p>
          Nadia would grow suspicious of him; first, he finds her a damn elixir
          out of nowhere and then provides her with all sorts of artifacts and
          techniques?
        </p>
        <p>
          She would not hesitate to either interrogate him herself or report to
          the clan. It did not matter if he and she shared the same blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time, he would be suspected of being a heretic or colluding
          with someone suspicious and would then be subjected to torture to spit
          everything he knows.
        </p>
        <p>
          So naturally, he cannot afford to provide her with anything he found.
        </p>
        <p>
          He can only keep it in moderation and take it slowly so he continues
          to maintain a smooth relationship with her and grow stronger himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Also, I need to be selective of what I give her... I should focus on
          what aspect I want to improve on and then provide her with an aid in
          that area. This way I can obtain tenfold benefits."
        </p>
        <p>He grinned as he mused about the future.</p>
        <p>________________________</p>

        <p>
          Under the heart of the clan's fortress, nestled this shady market
          where he was going to visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, the market became a labyrinth, with countless shops and
          hidden corners. There were various kinds of goods, ranging from the
          mundane to the mystical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forged weapons, enchanted tools for exorcism, scrolls containing
          various martial arts techniques, or even mysterious treasure maps—one
          could find anything in this market if one had the eyes to find them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Merchants wander around the market, hoping to hawk their wares to the
          clan members. Of course, among these treasures, there would be the
          occasional fake or useless trinket, so buyers had to be cautious.
        </p>
        <p>
          The market was rooted deeply in the clan and was specially managed by
          some of the top people of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was huge! It was not an exaggeration to say it was like a labyrinth
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>And why wouldn't it be?</p>
        <p>
          The clan had been established for centuries, generations after
          generations had gone by, leaving behind their marks.
        </p>
        <p>Not to mention, this was a clan famous for its exorcists;</p>
        <p>'Where there were exorcists, there were riches.'</p>
        <p>
          It was a famous line among the merchant circle, so it was no surprise
          that each clan had its own extensive network of supplies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Merchants would have to avail themselves of a special pass to be able
          to enter the clan and set up their business there, which involved a
          strict and tough background check.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt like it was quite similar to how the passport system
          worked in his previous world; well, at least he compared the two for
          his own ease of understanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were times when shady people would also get in to do business
          which was why Oliver referred to the market as a shady market.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan didn't interfere in the market unless absolutely necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          The things inside the market stayed inside the market! This was the
          clan's simple statement.
        </p>

        <p>
          As long as the clan's official activities were not hindered or
          bothered in any way, the market was free to operate as they wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any hindrances would not be tolerated; the clan followed a zero
          tolerance policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as the market thrived and kept making the clan a portion of
          profits, the clan would ensure security and provide other services.
        </p>
        <p>
          Respecting the decades of relationship clan shared with the various
          people in the market, they allowed them to do things freely even if it
          was slightly illegal..
        </p>
        <p>
          But what goes inside the market had nothing to do with the clan, so
          long as they don't interfere with the clan activities.
        </p>
        <p>His clan was really money-hungry!</p>
        <p>'Sigh, money works everywhere...'</p>
        <p>
          Two big open gates marked the entrance to this market; they were tall
          and imposing and had two guards in uniforms stationed there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at their uniform and immediately knew they were low-rank
          exorcists, either performing part-time missions or were helping their
          supervisors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guards at the entrance of the market had stiff expressions and
          were keenly maintaining a view on the surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were assigned to maintain balance, not let anyone cause too much
          trouble around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although no one would dare to spread chaos in the clan, there were
          still some idiots who would do stupid things against clan rules from
          time to time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver approached them with brisk steps; his temperament was great.
        </p>
        <p>The guards narrowed their eyes...</p>
        <p>White hair...</p>
        <p>Someone from the main family had come to visit the marketplace.</p>

        <p>But they had a ringing question in their minds.</p>
        <p>'Who is he?'</p>
        <p>They had never seen this young master before...?</p>
        <p>
          Still, they did not dare be negligent and immediately rushed to him.
        </p>
        <p>"Sir... Young master, greetings!"</p>
        <p>
          The guards bowed as they greeted him with respect; although they did
          not know who he was, his white hair was a symbol of respect.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one in the clan who had white hair was ordinary; they all had
          extraordinary backgrounds and powers behind them.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver nodded simply...</p>
        <p>"I have some things to look for. Don't mind me..."</p>
        <p>
          The two guards looked at each other with somewhat complicated
          expressions.
        </p>
        <p>How could they not mind?</p>
        <p>
          If something were to happen or someone were to offend him, then they
          would suffer grave consequences for not looking after him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver understood this, so he said, "Don't worry, I have my guards
          watching over. You two won't be held responsible."
        </p>
        <p>
          He said this in order to not have anyone following after him secretly.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he left as it was, then there was no doubt that one of them would
          come after him secretly, and he did not want anyone observing his
          findings and actions.
        </p>
        <p>Hearing this, the guards relaxed as they nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "Alright, feel free to call us if you need something, young master!"
        </p>
        <p>
          They felt that this young master was quite smart and understood their
          worries.
        </p>
        <p>With that, he left towards the market.</p>
        <p>And no sooner did he enter, he heard a loud voice...</p>
        <p>"BUY 2 GET 1 FREE...."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 23: Testing the special eyes! A book?</h2>

        <p>
          "Scram! I refuse to be fooled; you are secretly trying to make me pay
          for the 3rd invisible item!?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The shops were lively with customers bickering with the shop owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were shops arranged neatly, as one would expect from a festive
          market in his previous world.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver also realized something while strolling around.</p>
        <p>
          Although the clan was famous for its ruthless and crazy exorcists, in
          the end, it was still a clan that had always stood up for humanity
          against the demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The normal people inside were happy and healthy, proper sanitation was
          maintained throughout the place.
        </p>
        <p>
          'It looks like only those who belong to or are associated with the
          main family are the crazy ones...'
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered; there was not much specification in the novel when he was
          reading it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was just mentioned that the Mystic Purge Clan was extremely
          violent, ruthless, and vicious to their enemies, so much so they are
          feared even among humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          But looking at the lively market situated in the heart of the clan
          made him doubt the words he had read.
        </p>
        <p>He sighed and focused on what his purpose of the visit was.</p>
        <p>
          In the next moment, his eyes changed; a mysterious glint passed
          through his amethyst eyes slowly shifting its color to something else.
        </p>

        <p>It shifted from a light greenish-blue to a bleached purple...</p>
        <p>
          The world in his eyes changed; everything became visible to him,
          whether hidden or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at a passerby, but what he saw was not a human but a walking
          skeleton.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was able to vividly see all the 206 bones inside the person
          clearly; not only that, he could also see the amount of esper present
          inside the person's body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Focusing more on his eyes, the scene once again changed, and although
          diluted, he was now seeing the person's blood vessels, their muscles,
          flesh beneath the skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the bony structure was no longer visible, he could see more
          complex details.
        </p>
        <p>It was like layers in a body.</p>
        <p>
          Suppose the atomic and cellular constitution of a person is considered
          layer 0; then comes the skeletal and tissue layer above it, which
          could be said to be layer 1. Above that should be the muscular and
          vascular where organs, vessels, and other major human body parts
          become visible to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He decided not to view the layer 0 for the moment as he could feel the
          eyes were quite exhausting to use and he had a lot to use them for so
          he took it slow.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not have enough mastery and training to control the special
          eyes so he could only compromise at the moment and use them frugally.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, he limited himself to only see through when necessary,
          hopefully not needing him to use deeper than layer 2.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh! Young man, would you like to buy something? I saw you standing
          here for some time."
        </p>
        <p>
          A voice interrupted his thoughts as he looked at the man besides him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a man with a large bushy brown beard covering his face; he had
          black eyes and looked quite average.
        </p>
        <p>
          From his clothing style, Oliver realized he was a shopkeeper; his
          clothing style was foreign and did not align with the clan's
          traditional style of clothes.
        </p>

        <p>"That's right. I was looking for some things casually."</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, then sir, would you like to come see my shop? I have plenty of
          good things for exorcists. From your refined attire, I am sure you are
          a distinguished exorcist yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
          The bearded man started buttering up as he praised Oliver's style.
        </p>
        <p>"What do you sell? Show me."</p>
        <p>
          Since Oliver was here to buy some useful things, he decided to follow
          the man to his shop. There were many shop owners who would come out to
          attract customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, after watching Nadia's humungous talent and getting beaten
          by his siblings, Oliver felt he was quite vulnerable.
        </p>
        <p>Despite the system, he did not feel assured at all.</p>
        <p>
          The system only provided him with rewards at random times, which was
          not ideal. It would only provide the benefits when his target achieved
          a milestone in their training.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to use his own strength to counter threats he might face. So he
          must be prepared. He has already received a tenfold strength boost so
          he should at least train himself according to how an exorcist on the
          physical path would... for now at least.
        </p>
        <p>
          And apart from the system, the best strength he had was his knowledge
          from the novel which was the knowledge about the future of this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was the use of it all if he could not even use that knowledge to
          his advantage?
        </p>
        <p>I may be a side character, but I am not that useless.</p>
        <p>Creak.</p>
        <p>
          The man took him to a decent looking shop which was likely his shop.
          The interior was quite spacious and looked clean.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here it is; buy anything you like. If you buy in bulk, I will even
          give you a good discount."
        </p>

        <p>Looking around, he saw many things.</p>
        <p>
          Firearms, cold weapons, medication, books, potions, exorcism tools,
          neatly arranged scrolls, and some random materials and substances
          placed in glass boxes.
        </p>
        <p>This was an all-purpose store.</p>
        <p>His pockets suddenly trembled a little...</p>
        <p>
          Although he was one of the young masters of the clan, his budget was
          definitely not young master-like...
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he had asked for some money from the clan a while ago and
          thus was allotted some amount by the supervising maid but he felt it
          was not enough at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          From his knowledge, all the young heirs of the clan were showered in
          riches.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention, Nadia, who could buy anything she wanted with just
          a word.
        </p>
        <p>'Fuck! I feel like a beggar!'</p>
        <p>He could not help but exclaim.</p>
        <p>
          'I need to prepare a source of money for myself soon... I can't be
          dependent on the clan always.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver frowned; he had many ideas in his mind that he would be
          developing in the future, and many of his ideas required massive funds
          to even start.
        </p>
        <p>He needed money.</p>
        <p>
          The human world had adapted a common currency, which was called Neden.
        </p>
        <p>For comparisons, a loaf of bread costs around 1 Neden.</p>
        <p>'Sigh... money is always the problem.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's scanned the shop items for something he might be interested
          in.
        </p>
        <p>"What's that book about?"</p>
        <p>He suddenly pointed at a book in a brownish cover.</p>
        <p>The shop owner looked over with keen eyes and told,</p>
        <p>"Ah, that book is a..."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 24: Purchasing the book and Getting Robbed!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 24</p>
        <p>
          "Ah, that book is a martial arts book. It records a decent martial art
          technique focused on movements. It's called [Six Thoughtful Steps of
          the Spirits]."
        </p>
        <p>'So it was that...'</p>
        <p>Oliver raised a brow as he pretended to be in thought.</p>
        <p>
          In reality, the martial art technique focusing on movement was a
          common technique that could be found in multiple places.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was nothing special about it in the eyes of normal exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could find copies of this martial art distributed around the
          human territories.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a decent technique to learn and master, and undoubtedly, it
          helped many exorcists who mastered it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what people didn't know was that this was an incomplete technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, this martial art technique was a part that belonged to an
          important technique in the story.
        </p>
        <p>The technique was called...</p>
        <p>The technique was called [Spirit Stretch].</p>
        <p>
          An unbelievably fast movement technique that spirits of the world use
          to travel.
        </p>
        <p>
          This technique needed to be joined with other parts of the main
          technique in order for all the conditions to be fulfilled.
        </p>
        <p>
          What was even more absurd was that someone was able to complete this
          due to a very strange reason.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the novel, a character in the academy arc was able to collect all
          the parts of this technique and received [Spirit Stretch] directly
          from the spirits.
        </p>
        <p>How was he able to achieve that?</p>
        <p>
          It was all thanks to his severe obsession with anything related to
          spirits. It was borderline disgusting but in a world where wars and
          demons were rampant, no one cared for some exorcist's weird fetishes.
        </p>
        <p>"I will take this."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver told the shop owner, getting [Spirit Stretch] would be
          extremely beneficial for him considering the character who had it in
          the novel was always able to escape whenever his class fell in trouble
          with demons.
        </p>
        <p>"That'll be 500 Neden."</p>
        <p>Oliver cursed the shopkeeper, this was so expensive.</p>
        <p>"What's the discounted price?" He asked.</p>
        <p>
          "I won't make much profit on it so this does not have a discount."
        </p>
        <p>"What? No, you must do something about it, otherwise, forget it."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver quickly applied the 'Going, Going, Gone' tactic he had learned
          in his previous life while performing bargaining and negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>"This..."</p>
        <p>
          The man was speechless at this moment. He hadn't made many sales since
          the morning and Oliver was his first customer that he had gone to
          bring himself.
        </p>
        <p>He couldn't let Oliver leave without selling something.</p>
        <p>
          "Haah... Alright, I am willing to lower the price if you buy something
          else as well."
        </p>
        <p>It was not a bad deal.</p>
        <p>
          "Then give me that." Oliver pointed his finger to one of the glass
          boxes that had a material placed under it.
        </p>

        <p>A black material that was somewhat transparent, and mirror-like.</p>
        <p>
          It was known to be very light, malleable in solid form. This substance
          had a waxy texture in solid form. This material's melting point was
          one of the highest known. Not to mention it was superconductive.
        </p>
        <p>It was called Hypon.</p>
        <p>It was generally used to make tough esper specialized weapons.</p>
        <p>He had some use for it so he decided to purchase it.</p>
        <p>
          "Thank you for your purchase. Your total will be 2000 Neden after
          discount."
        </p>
        <p>"Here."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver quickly received a bag containing his items and paid the owner
          his amount. It was a lot but even a small quantity of Hypon was
          considered quite expensive as it was a rare material.
        </p>
        <p>With that, he left the shop.</p>
        <p>
          Back at the market, he purchased a few more things... until suddenly
          something happened...
        </p>
        <p>"No way... there's no way..."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver widened his eyes as he looked at the bag containing his things.
        </p>
        <p>"WHERE THE FUCK IS MY WALLET!?"</p>
        <p>That's right, he had been pickpocketed.</p>
        <p>
          "Someone actually dares to pickpocket... more importantly, I did not
          even realize it until now when I needed it."
        </p>
        <p>He could not help but mutter in utter disbelief.</p>
        <p>
          Someone dared to pickpocket one of the young masters of the clan in
          broad daylight.
        </p>

        <p>
          The same clan where they were walking right now belonged to his
          family.
        </p>
        <p>Yet they dare to rob someone from that family.</p>
        <p>
          He frowned as he realized that not everyone was aware that
          white-haired people were the members of the Mystic family.
        </p>
        <p>
          His clan might be popular but the main people of the clan were always
          shrouded in mystery.
        </p>
        <p>It was no wonder he got robbed.</p>
        <p>
          A normal young master of the clan wouldn't allow themselves to be
          pickpocketed, it was just that Oliver also had heightened senses but
          he was walking around like an idiot.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had never seen such magical items in his previous life, all of this
          felt new and mystical to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything here was supernatural in his eyes, he was just so lost in
          exploring everything like a child in a candy store that his guard was
          lowered severely which resulted in this.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan market provided him with a sense of security and thus he
          unknowingly didn't notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, no sane young master would walk around a market like
          him. His circumstances were different and he had to do it in order to
          buy resources for himself.
        </p>
        <p>'I should have been careful...'</p>
        <p>
          His eyes turned mystical once again as he looked around... hoping to
          find the one who had pickpocketed him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to no avail, he could not find the thief, it was quite evident
          that he had been robbed some time ago and by now the thief was
          probably quite far away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sigh..." His hands went to his pocket and retrieved a couple of
          notes, he barely had any Neden left now. Most of his money was in the
          wallet that had been now stolen.
        </p>
        <p>"This is so frustrating!"</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, after thinking about it, he could not help but
          suddenly have dark ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at the few near shops and the crowd of customers
          bargaining.
        </p>
        <p>"No! What am I thinking!?"</p>
        <p>
          He felt ridiculous, although it wouldn't be an issue for him to rob
          these people secretly by taking advantage of the crowd, he felt it was
          just too low.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had read how protagonists would fall low after their reincarnations
          and transmigrations, and he felt it was understandable but right now
          his mind was not ready to rob the innocent ones who might be poorer
          than him.
        </p>
        <p>
          What difference would there be between him and the person who stole
          his wallet?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Instead..." His eyes narrowed, with [Cosmic Void Gaze], he could see
          quite far and there were a couple of presences that made him a little
          interested.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 25: Auction? Abusing [Cosmic Void Gaze] for profit</h2>
        <p>Chapter 25</p>
        <p>
          He followed the path all the way there and noticed a group of people.
        </p>
        <p>
          Compared to others, they looked more refined and had better-looking
          clothes than the normal Joe.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were surrounded by exorcists who were probably serving as
          bodyguards.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcists were hired to be bodyguards because there would be times
          when intense fights would sometimes break out between fellow business
          owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan did not care about what happened inside the market area; if
          you die, then you die.
        </p>
        <p>As long as the clan was not affected...</p>
        <p>
          Of course, this also applied to all the official members of the clan.
          If you were going to enter the market and cause trouble and later get
          caught in trouble then...
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, no one dared to try that; everyone knew that official clan
          members would be given immunity to such rules whatsoever so no one
          messed with them even in the market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver blended in with the crowd that was gathering around them and
          asked someone about the situation.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey, what's going on here?"</p>
        <p>
          "What!? You don't know? One of the biggest auctions of the year is
          going to take place soon. Those people over there are important guests
          invited by the clan."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver was stunned.</p>
        <p>Auction?</p>
        <p>
          Indeed, there were auctions too that took place all around the year,
          at different scales in different places.
        </p>

        <p>
          It would seem that there was going to be an auction soon in the market
          and these people in expensive clothing were probably traders or
          merchants invited by the clan to auction their items or buy items.
        </p>
        <p>
          Receiving an invitation from one of the 5 clans was no joke; these
          people must be really influential to get invited to the auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes shone with intensity as the world around him shifted.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the special eyes, he was able to see that the important-looking
          person was not an exorcist but a normal human but...
        </p>
        <p>
          His body was glowing in multiple auras, espera was flowing through
          vital parts of his body such as his chest, shoulders, abdominal
          area...
        </p>
        <p>'There are probably multiple artifacts on his body...'</p>
        <p>Oliver concluded quickly as there was no better explanation.</p>
        <p>
          He shifted his focus to the exorcists around them and his eyes
          immediately narrowed.
        </p>
        <p>They were... strong.</p>
        <p>
          Their bodies were leaking abundant espera; it was flowing out
          continuously, he could feel tense just seeing that amount of espera
          through.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vibrations in the air and the fluctuations around them were quite
          strong and erratic.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm...?"</p>
        <p>One of the exorcists within the group suddenly looked around.</p>
        <p>
          He felt like he was being watched by something... and it was giving
          him chills for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>But upon looking around, all he could see were normal people.</p>
        <p>'Imagination...?'</p>
        <p>He decided to leave it at that and focus on his job.</p>

        <p>In the distance, Oliver also left the crowd and went his own way.</p>
        <p>
          He now wanted to participate in the auction; there were always great
          items listed in auctions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to take part in the auction but he had no money; it would be
          useless to go there penniless.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is "penniless" the correct term even? Should I say "Neden-less"
          instead?'
        </p>
        <p>He wondered as he could not think of any normal way to earn cash.</p>
        <p>
          'Robbing strangers, robbing shops, threatening the weak with my
          superior strength, abusing my status, begging, blackmailing weak
          exorcists...?'
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck! Why is my mind filled with such dark thoughts!? Could it be
          that I am a scumbag?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver seriously wondered this... apart from shady ways that would
          definitely land him in trouble sooner or later, he was not getting any
          ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          'If I must choose a shady method, then I should go with something that
          is the least shadiest... and won't land me into too much trouble.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought, a variety of dangerous ideas going in and out of his mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ay, young man, how 'bout checking out some stuff? I got plenty of
          stuff over here for ya."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked to his side and saw a man with a small wooden stall at
          the corner of the road, talking to a customer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he barely had enough money left, he also went over to the
          shop.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was now thinking about selling some low-price artifacts at a higher
          price to make some profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Auctions were rare and he didn't want to miss one now that he knew
          about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, hey there, another exorcist youngster! C'mon over, I've got loads
          of stuff you might dig!"
        </p>

        <p>
          The stall owner looked to be in his middle age with a bald head and a
          few yellow teeth missing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stall owner did not care about Oliver's height and child-like
          appearance, there were many exorcists roaming around with stopped
          growth or cursed bodies so it was not a surprise to see one in flesh,
          although it was quite rare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ignoring him, Oliver looked at the items with his special eyes. He
          decided to start with this shop first and then move on to search more.
        </p>
        <p>'All of them are fake and cheap replicas... hmm?'</p>
        <p>
          Just as he was scanning the items on the counter, his eyes caught
          something shining.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a marble that was shining brightly; as he focused on the round
          marble, the colors became even more evident, a strong espera was
          flowing inside the ordinary-looking red marble.
        </p>
        <p>The marble was not ordinary at all.</p>
        <p>"How much for that sword?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver concealed his excitement and asked in a low voice pointing at a
          random old sword which was also a cheap replica.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You got good eyes, young man. This sword used to be a possession of a
          great warrior in ancient times; I had to specially enter the ruins to
          get my hands on it. But for your cute face, I'll sell it for 2000
          Neden, how abo—"
        </p>
        <p>"Forget it."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver cut him short and looked around pointing at a few more things
          but even before the stall owner could complete their prices, he
          directly cut him off.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stall owner felt quite infuriated at this presumptuous nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, he pointed at the red round marble and asked in a somewhat
          colder tone.
        </p>
        <p>"How much for that marble?"</p>
        <p>"700 Neden."</p>
        <p>
          This time, the stall owner did not weave any bullshit story; he knew
          that Oliver was not a weak player, he seemed quite experienced in
          bargaining.
        </p>
        <p>"50 Neden." He put up his own price.</p>
        <p>
          "Impossible! Are you trying to rob me!?" The stall owner protested
          immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then give a normal price, I know what you are doing here. Listen, I
          don't have time for these scam games; put a good price or I'll just
          leave."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver said in a bored tone.</p>
        <p>
          And as expected, the expression on the stall owner's face changed.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 26: Mysterious organization</h2>
        <p>Chapter 26</p>
        <p>"Forget it. I will buy from others."</p>
        <p>
          The expression on the stall owner's face changed when he heard that.
        </p>
        <p>
          This made the stall owner feel pressured; even he knew that what he
          had brought was all trash not worth selling. Oliver had already
          changed several options, and he felt that this time he might really
          leave.
        </p>
        <p>If this went on, then he would not be able to scam him.</p>
        <p>
          "Sigh, 150 Neden. Don't bargain, this is the lowest I can do. I have a
          wife at home and two kid—wait!?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He saw that Oliver began to leave without listening to his sad story.
        </p>
        <p>"Alright, I will do it for 70 Neden. Please, I beg."</p>
        <p>
          "Fine, here you go." Oliver paused and showed a smile as he handed
          over a 70 Neden bill.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt quite proud that he directly had the seller reduce the price
          by 10 times!
        </p>
        <p>From 700 to 70 Neden, his skills were quite useful.</p>
        <p>
          In fact, this small marble that was now in his hands was probably an
          artifact of some sorts and could even fetch tens of thousands if sold
          carefully with negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could tell from the strong and turbulent espera flow inside it.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Haha..." Oliver felt funny, although he had basically just robbed the
          stall owner, he did not feel that bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          The owner of that stall reeked of cheap booze and had the eyes of a
          big scammer; who knows how many people he had scammed in the past.
        </p>
        <p>So it was only right for him to be scammed back.</p>
        <p>
          His eyes lit up! He knew that he might just be able to generate enough
          income to at least get one item from the auction... probably.
        </p>
        <p>
          'No... there will be ultra-rich individuals... it's possible I might
          not get anything at all.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly suppressed his emotions and looked straight at the various
          shops ahead.
        </p>
        <p>He still had some spare left.</p>
        <p>
          So he visited various stores at random, collecting anything that
          looked useful but was being sold at the wrong price.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, he managed to buy some things.</p>
        <p>
          A round red marble, an ivory rope, a broken shard, and last but not
          least, a shiny purple medal.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now he was officially broke with nothing in his pockets or savings
          at his home.
        </p>
        <p>"Haha..."</p>
        <p>He let out a nervous laugh; he was a spender—a dangerous one.</p>
        <p>
          It would be a terrible situation if no one bought what he had
          purchased just now...
        </p>
        <p>'Now I have to sell all this...'</p>

        <p>
          He scratched his head, thinking, 'Otherwise, I won't even be able to
          buy meat for Zippy.'
        </p>
        <p>'Fortunately, there is a place just right for that.'</p>
        <p>Black Codex Federation!</p>
        <p>
          An organization that was spread all across the exorcist world,
          single-handedly competing with the top 5 clans in terms of wealth and
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an organization that had a huge influence and dealt with all
          sorts of business.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had their stores in almost all major cities—dominating all the
          businesses around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          'In the novel, this organization dealt both in light and dark. On the
          surface, they were an influential merchant organization while in the
          dark, they did all sorts of shady business, from taking assassination
          requests to infiltration. They were so bold to even provoke the top
          clans sometimes during the multiple arcs.'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver recalled what he knew of the organization.</p>
        <p>
          Right now, he was heading straight to their established store that was
          also located in the clan's market.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had to provide the clan with heavy resources and treasures for
          them to be even allowed to operate inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          'In the novel, the Black Codex Federation had a neutral relation with
          Mystic Purge Clan, both wary of the other. Even in the blood arc, they
          did not provoke the Mystic Purge Clan...'
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought as he reached before a humungous structure shadowing
          everything around.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tall, well-designed building—a miracle of this world's modern
          architecture.
        </p>
        <p>The building gave Oliver an intimidating vibe.</p>
        <p>
          He smiled wryly; just the guards stationed at the doors were full of
          espera.
        </p>

        <p>
          As he went near the gates, the guards did not stop him, nor did they
          perform a mandatory check they always performed on normal visitors.
        </p>
        <p>'So they know my identity...'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was not even surprised by this. If such a big organization did
          not have their guard memorize the important people of the place where
          they operate, how could they be so successful?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not like in the cliché novels where the guards would stop the
          protagonist and treat him as a beggar only to be face-slapped later.
        </p>
        <p>
          After he entered the building, one of the guards took out a
          rectangular device.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Oliver was here, he would instantly recognize that as a smartphone.
        </p>
        <p>
          This world was just a few years backward from his previous world in
          terms of tech, so it was not a shock that they had started to develop
          smartphones. Not to mention, this world had some strange things thanks
          to the presence of espera and other magical elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guard pressed a button and said, "An unknown boy with white hair
          has entered the establishment. I did not stop him. I am not sure if he
          belongs to the main family or not..."
        </p>
        <p>
          The voice on the other end was silent for a moment before it said, "No
          problem, I will inform madam; you did good."
        </p>
        <p>With that, the call ended instantly.</p>
        <p>
          It was a mesmerizing sight, filled with gleaming gold and silver
          artifacts, precious gems, shimmering jewels, and relics and artifacts
          radiating ancient aura. The sun's soft rays seeped in from the glass
          windows, casting a warm, comfortable glow throughout the pavilion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an amazing architectural build with exquisite mastery and hard
          work of the designer.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the front was a reception counter and behind it was the
          receptionist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver went up to her and asked, "I want to sell some things. Willing
          to take a look?"
        </p>
        <p>He made it short and crisp, no-nonsense talk.</p>
        <p>
          The receptionist stared at his face for a moment; even though Oliver
          was just a little kid, she recognized his white hair and amethyst
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>He was definitely a member of the main family in her eyes.</p>
        <p>
          If some other random little kid had wandered in the store, she would
          have asked them to leave and not cause trouble for candy, but she
          could not ignore his presence.
        </p>
        <p>She had strict orders from above as well.</p>
        <p>"Very well, sir, please follow me..."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 27: Receiving money and... Invitation?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 27</p>
        <p>
          "Very well, sir. Please follow me to the room behind, where I will
          appraise the item you wish to sell," she answered in a professional
          tone and led Oliver to another room. This room was relatively normal;
          it had two sofas facing each other and a table in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the room was occupied by various shelves and accessories.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well then, please show me what you wish to sell?" she asked him to
          take out his items, although she was not an expert appraiser but she
          still had her fair share of experience as an appraiser and was a
          little confident in evaluating the little young master's materials.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver glanced at her once and then withdrew, just one look from his
          eyes, he could tell she was not as strong as the guards outside; he
          could even overpower her with brute strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he still did not say anything, she might have extensive knowledge,
          or else she wouldn't be the receptionist of the store belonging to
          Black Codex Federation.
        </p>
        <p>Tap</p>
        <p>
          He put his bag on the table and took a seat comfortably, crossing his
          legs like an arrogant young master, he told her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "All the items in that bag. I want to know the price you could provide
          for them."
        </p>
        <p>
          The receptionist's lips twitched slightly when she heard this, and her
          expression could not help but strain a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was now wondering if this spoiled young master had only come here
          to make some extra cash off them by selling his house furniture or
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that was the case indeed and then later he realizes that all he
          brought along were ordinary things worth nothing then it might not be
          good.
        </p>
        <p>
          This kid was someone from the main family of the clan, one of the
          heirs probably so if she refused him or hurt his high ego, he might
          create trouble for their establishment.
        </p>
        <p>'Sigh, what a troublesome brat...'</p>

        <p>
          She sighed internally and opened the bag to look at the items, no
          matter if the situation escalated, her superior would be the one to
          handle him not her.
        </p>
        <p>She was here only to tell the honest review of the items.</p>
        <p>"Hmm??"</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes could not help but widen slightly when she took out the items
          one by one.
        </p>
        <p>"This... all of them are artifacts!?"</p>
        <p>
          She could not help but exclaim as she looked at Oliver's mocking
          expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if he already knew what she was thinking and how she felt
          embarrassed now.
        </p>
        <p>
          She shyly lowered her head and began seriously inspecting the items
          one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was provided with a cup of coffee to drink while the
          receptionist did her work.
        </p>
        <p>'This does not taste good... ugh!'</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but feel weird at the bland or plain taste of the
          coffee.
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>
        <p>Half an hour later</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was sipping his bland coffee with a dull expression. The drink
          had successfully managed to ruin his mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I will definitely introduce some fine coffee to this world in the
          future.'
        </p>
        <p>He made a mental note as he finished the coffee.</p>

        <p>
          The receptionist was also done appraising everything, and she had a
          flabbergasted look on her face.
        </p>
        <p>She coughed to clear the awkward atmosphere and said,</p>
        <p>"I've appraised all of the things except this."</p>
        <p>
          She said as she picked up the purple medal Oliver had picked up
          earlier from one of the old stalls he forgot about.
        </p>
        <p>
          He narrowed his eyes as he remembered that this was the thing that had
          costed him the most to purchase but since he saw the strong espera
          bursting out of it, he purchased it in the end.
        </p>
        <p>He did not expect her to not be able to appraise it.</p>
        <p>It was indeed a great treasure.</p>
        <p>
          "Is that so? Then what? Is this what your establishment is capable
          of?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His tone was superior despite being the smaller one in stature; if one
          looked closely, he barely reached her waist if he stood up.
        </p>
        <p>
          The receptionist frowned and quickly said, "Sir, please don't think so
          low of us. We have experts with us; they will quickly assess the item
          for you. I am just an intern."
        </p>
        <p>"Alright then bring it to them and get it appraised."</p>
        <p>
          "Before that, would you like to know the total amount you will receive
          if you sell everything excluding the medal?"
        </p>
        <p>The receptionist questioned.</p>
        <p>"How much?"</p>
        <p>"It'll be around 300,000 Neden, sir."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not maintain his composure at the moment no matter what;
          she directly dropped a bomb on his head.
        </p>

        <p>He was not expecting his items to fetch so high.</p>
        <p>
          At maximum, he had expected around a 90-100k Neden but this was
          unexpected. Although being able to see the espera waves inside an an
          object was very difficult task even for an expert exorcist, he was
          able to achieve it quite easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          The receptionist could not help but show a smirk as she looked at him
          losing his arrogant composure.
        </p>
        <p>
          "W-Well then, take them away and give me the money. Also have the
          medal appraised quick."
        </p>
        <p>"As you say, please wait here while I prepare your amount."</p>
        <p>With that, the receptionist left the room, and he sighed.</p>
        <p>
          'Damn, I shouldn't act like this! I am sure 300,000 Neden is nothing
          to a young master of the clan; I must maintain my dignity or else they
          will not take me seriously in the future.'
        </p>
        <p>He calmed down, and the receptionist returned shortly.</p>
        <p>
          She was carrying a silver tray, and on it, there was a black metal
          card placed.
        </p>
        <p>It had the official symbol of the bank.</p>
        <p>
          "Sir, here is your amount, we have stored all 300,000 Neden in this
          card."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver picked up the card and put it in his pocket safely; he was not
          going to lose it this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As for the medal, actually, about that, I have something to tell
          you." The receptionist paused for a moment before she added.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My supervisor is directly appraising the medal and is very interested
          in the medal... she has invited young master to discuss something
          important, if you don't mind, I will take you to meet my supervisor."
        </p>
        <p>She said in a calm tone.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but be puzzled, it was so good that they wanted
          to discuss it personally?
        </p>
        <p>"Alright." Seeing her expression, he agreed.</p>
        <p>
          With that, he followed her as he saw her enter a corridor and then
          take an elevator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon reaching the 4th floor, they stopped, and she exited the elevator
          followed by Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were now in front of a room as he saw her knock at the door a few
          times and say, "I have brought him, madam."
        </p>
        <p>"Enter."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 28: The medal was appraised!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 28</p>
        <p>"Enter."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver heard a sharp feminine voice on the other side of the door as
          they entered the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          What greeted him was a normal room with carpeted floor, walls with a
          wooden finish, multiple shelves carrying various books and antiques
          placed in them...
        </p>
        <p>
          In the middle of the room was an office desk and behind it was a woman
          sitting.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her stunning appearance and could not help but shake
          his head secretly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the novel, it was often mentioned how beautiful the people were;
          the beauty standards in this world were way ahead than his previous
          world. A supermodel from his previous world could be a commoner on the
          streets, and no one would care.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only the most beautiful were looked up to and praised... He wondered
          if it was due to the presence of esper in this world that boosted
          people's vitality and kept them young.
        </p>

        <p>
          'My charm is level 3. This should be considered pretty high
          considering that even my tenfold increased strength is also at the
          same level.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing that he could grow up to be handsome, he felt relieved as he
          focused back on the woman behind the desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had long raven-black hair, she was tall and had an athletic build
          with proper curves. Her beady eyes were piercing ice blue. She had
          jade-white skin that looked smooth and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes looked cold and had a piercing gaze which would make others
          uncomfortable... the overall air around her reeked of superiority and
          power.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was wearing a stylish dress that further emphasized her curves.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips were painted with cherry-red lip gloss as she threw the
          receptionist a glance who quickly left the room leaving the two alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her cherry-red lips moved as she picked up a document and read it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Young master Oliver, the 4th son of the main family, not allowed to
          live with the main lineage despite sharing the same blood but no
          talent whatsoever—practically isolated from your own family. First
          time in the market and you visit small stores and coincidentally pick
          artifacts out of trash?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She placed the documents back on the table as she once again met his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Little boy, being branded as talentless, and hiding such terrifying
          appraisal talent? What are your intentions exactly in coming to us?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She clasped her hands on the table and looked at him just how a noble
          would look at a commoner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver tried his best to maintain a poker face, while his heart was
          beating wildly. He didn't expect her to be able to gather so much
          information about him in such a short duration.
        </p>

        <p>
          He didn't believe that she even knew who he was before he stepped
          inside this establishment.
        </p>
        <p>'What a terrifying information network!'</p>
        <p>
          He secretly exclaimed to himself; he had not expected her to even know
          about all his activities in the market as well.
        </p>
        <p>He looked at her as a glint passed through his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          In the next moment, his eyes widened, and a sharp headache followed
          afterward.
        </p>
        <p>"Ugh-!"</p>
        <p>He could not help but suddenly groan slightly.</p>
        <p>
          The woman tilted her head, a bit confused as to what happened to the
          little boy in front of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her perspective, he was just standing there trying to maintain a
          poker face to show his courage but suddenly his eyes widened and he
          pressed his forehead as if in pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this was understandable, [Cosmic Void Gaze] was an inherent
          ability that was literally undetectable unless Oliver intended to let
          others know about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could be seen that when he asked the 2nd brother to look into his
          eyes before, he intended to directly attack his mind so the 2nd
          brother was able to catch a glimpse of its power.
        </p>
        <p>Otherwise, it was not detectable at all.</p>
        <p>
          At most, others would feel someone was looking at them but that's
          it... if someone was especially perceptive they might even feel
          threatened but since he was just in front of her, she didn't feel any
          of the above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also it was not a shock that she was able to see through his facade of
          trying to act nonchalant, she was a lot more experienced than Oliver
          and dealt with all sorts of people so she knew of such tactics.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention, Oliver was just a kid in her eyes who was trying
          hard to keep his facial muscles relaxed but was unable to do so in her
          presence.
        </p>

        <p>'Fuck. What did I just see!?'</p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, his body was tingling as goosebumps made his hair
          stand to no end.
        </p>
        <p>Just now he had caught the glimpse of her power.</p>
        <p>
          He wanted to know what her level was and how strong she was actually.
        </p>
        <p>But when he saw her espera amount, his eyes almost got blinded.</p>
        <p>It was too strong!</p>
        <p>She was suppressing a massive amount of esper inside her body...</p>
        <p>
          Her esper was like a blazing sun, radiating a brilliant glow that
          filled his entire vision. It was overwhelming despite not flowing out
          of her body.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was stronger than anything Oliver had ever seen. He knew the moment
          he saw that he was in the presence of a true powerhouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          He forcefully suppressed the anxiety in his heart, at the same time,
          his mind was filled with curiosity, he wanted to know what secrets she
          was carrying within her.
        </p>
        <p>Why was she in their clan with such strength...?</p>
        <p>"It's nothing." He smiled, a bit softly as he replied to her.</p>
        <p>
          "I just want to make a couple of Neden, since you already know my
          situation then you should know that I am not provided with a budget
          like my siblings and I have to survive on my own."
        </p>
        <p>
          He answered, carefully considering the situation at hand. What could
          she want from him?
        </p>
        <p>She wouldn't call for him just to appraise an item, would she?</p>
        <p>He took a deep breath.</p>
        <p>
          "I heard you want to talk to me about the medal? Have you appraised
          it?" He couldn't help but ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman was silent observing his demeanor before she opened a drawer
          by her side and placed the purple medal on her desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It has been appraised successfully, and I must say this is quite the
          thing you have stumbled upon."
        </p>
        <p>Her tone carried a hint of amusement.</p>
        <p>
          "This medal is not an ordinary exorcist artifact. It is the [Medal of
          Eternal Pain]."
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 29: Bargaining for price!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 29</p>
        <p>
          "This medal is not an ordinary exorcist artifact. It is called the
          [Medal of Eternal Pain]," she said to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver heard her, and for a moment, he stopped whatever he was
          thinking.
        </p>
        <p>Medal of Eternal Pain?</p>
        <p>
          'Is this...?' He glanced at the medal placed on the wooden desk and
          could not help but be taken aback.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was taken aback not because he realized that it was a precious
          treasure but because he knew what exactly it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Medal of Eternal pain? Wasn't this supposed to be in the hands of
          Caiden Falcon, a minor antagonist in the early academy arc? What's it
          doing here?'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver was a little surprised by this...</p>
        <p>
          'In the novel, the Medal of Eternal Pain was supposed to be an
          opalescent orange color? But this is clearly different...? Does it
          change according to its owner's espera or something?'
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly pretended not to know anything about it and curiously asked
          her, "What does it do?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "According to me, [Medal of Eternal Pain] has two effects: Agony
          Infliction and Curse Endurance," she tapped the purple medal with her
          sharp fingernails.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw how she had painted her nails with silver-colored nail
          polish.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Agony Infliction allows the possessor of this artifact to send
          excruciating pain to a specified target upon physical contact. The
          level of pain depends on the espera of the user. Curse Endurance, on
          the other hand, ensures that the pain inflicted by the medal persists
          indefinitely until the owner of the artifact wills it to stop. Not to
          mention, it also provides some resistance to curses in general as
          well."
        </p>
        <p>The woman finished her explanation and looked back at Oliver.</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes held a strange glint as she eyed Oliver, in her eyes, he was
          clearly a little kid who has yet to step out of his clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although she could not sense any espera from him, she was not much
          disappointed knowing that he was extremely talentless. She was more
          interested in how he was able to pick out such interesting artifacts
          on his first try.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was definitely not luck that he managed to do all of this. She knew
          it was impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How about it? If you are interested in selling this medal, I'll give
          you a really good price."
        </p>
        <p>
          She asked him, feeling greatly interested in this artifact, she needed
          this in order to commence her own 'plans.'
        </p>
        <p>
          "A good price? How much is that?" Oliver raised a brow and did not
          speak much.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm... let me guess, how does a million Neden sound?" She said
          casually.
        </p>
        <p>
          'A million Neden!' Oliver hissed internally, he suddenly felt that
          this woman was very rich.
        </p>
        <p>'But...'</p>
        <p>
          "It's too low." He said, the slight moment of need in her eyes towards
          the artifact did not go unnoticed by him, aware that she wanted this
          artifact, he decided to take a little advantage.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Little? Look at your little body and brain. Do you know how the
          market works? What price do you think this would sell for then?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman had an intimidating and commanding aura as she leaned back
          and crossed her legs which were clad in silk black stockings.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at the pair of long and curvy legs, Oliver was not distracted,
          his mind was occupied by benefits he could extract from her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know how the market works, 300,000 for all the artifacts I brought
          and this [Medal of Eternal Pain] which is quite clearly an ancient and
          powerful artifact, you aren't fooling anyone here."
        </p>
        <p>He boldly told her as she watched him in surprise.</p>
        <p>
          There were only a few people who could act so casually in her presence
          once they get to know her real identity, her aura alone was enough to
          silence masses.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Perhaps because he's just a little kid.' She shook her head, she
          didn't expect Oliver to be able to sense even a glimpse of her
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her eyes, he didn't have much espera inside his body which
          restricted him to feel her aura.
        </p>
        <p>'Ignorance is bliss as they say.'</p>
        <p>
          She felt a little amused by his behavior, it's been time since she was
          feeling the urge to play with someone.
        </p>
        <p>"Then how much do you suggest, little boy?"</p>
        <p>
          She had a smirk on her face as she said it, which Oliver felt like she
          did to provoke him.
        </p>
        <p>He remained calm against her silly acts and told her straight.</p>
        <p>"30 Million Neden."</p>
        <p>
          The woman almost choked when she heard him casually utter 30 million
          as if he was asking for 30 Neden.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Are you kidding? Little boy, do you even have the capacity to bring
          that much money back safely?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt he was intentionally asking such an outrageous sum of money.
        </p>
        <p>"3 million Neden."</p>
        <p>"25 million Neden."</p>
        <p>"5 million..."</p>
        <p>"20 million..."</p>
        <p>"10 million..."</p>
        <p>"15 million..."</p>
        <p>"13 million, a middle take. You accept it or leave."</p>
        <p>She firmly told him after a series of fierce negotiations.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was also helpless, she was surely capable of giving him more
          but was stubborn and he could not just leave from here before selling
          the artifact.
        </p>
        <p>
          He admitted that she was quite strong when it came to making deals,
          but still, he did not feel that he made a loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least he made her increase her previous price by 13 times which was
          quite good.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that he might be able to sell the artifact for more but he was
          in a hurry to sell it before auction, and finding a buyer who could
          offer such a sum of money before that was very hard. Plus he did not
          want to be near this artifact for a reason.
        </p>
        <p>So, in the end, he just accepted it.</p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Oliver did not realize that the woman was thinking
          the same thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He sure has a knack for business. If raised in the right way, he
          could make great profits in the future. Although he's lacking and
          easily concedes, he can improve that growing up.'
        </p>
        <p>
          She was getting interested in this little boy in front of her who was
          carrying a bunch of secrets within himself.
        </p>
        <p>There was a reason why Oliver...</p>

        <h2>Chapter 30: History of the Medal and an unexpected situation...</h2>
        <p>Chapter 30</p>
        <p>"Deal."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver accepted the money; he believed it should be enough to buy him
          at least one artifact from the auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a particular reason he did not take the artifact for
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yes, one of the reasons for that was that he wanted to purchase
          something from the auction and did not currently need the medal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second and most important reason was that he knew about the bad
          side-effects this medal had.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Medal of Eternal Pain], with such an ominous name, had a dark history
          associated with it, as explained briefly in the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was told in the novel that this artifact was originally found by a
          camper when he visited an ancient forest with the intention to
          explore.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, the camper was not sure about the forest; it was rumored to
          be famous for its notorious death rates and ghostly activities, as
          claimed by the nearby residents.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to prove everyone wrong and become famous. He knew of demons
          and exorcists yet refused to believe that something dangerous would be
          in the forest. He wanted to try something that no normal human had
          ever done before...
        </p>
        <p>
          But as he went forward, ironically towards the same direction where he
          found a broken skull, he started to encounter strange things. He
          didn't think the skull belonged to a human; it could have been animal
          remains.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind would sometimes hallucinate about things that shouldn't exist
          in the world; very dark thoughts started to cloud his mind as he went
          on silently.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was unaware that he was being affected by something; his mind was
          distracted towards a particular direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          It became even worse when he started to find strange dead bodies one
          by one; all those corpses had signs of extreme torture being
          performed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The corpses were rotting, but their state was beyond tolerable for the
          camper; he puked blood, yet strangely enough, he wanted to keep going,
          and he did. It was as if all of this around him was just another
          imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of corpses he encountered started to increase, to the point
          that he could probably stack them up to form a small hill.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of them had expressions of pain; it was clear that none of them
          had received a peaceful death.
        </p>
        <p>The strange hallucinations in his mind intensified.</p>
        <p>
          Scenes of an unknown cannibalistic tribe flashed through his mind one
          after another.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tribe that was savage, cruel, and inhuman; they were demons or
          humans, he didn't know. They messed with something that they shouldn't
          have and it spilled their doom.
        </p>
        <p>
          He soon reached a broken shrine, and in the middle of everything, he
          found the medal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whispers in his ears prompted him to take the medal, and he did,
          quickly leaving the area. But alas, he couldn't even leave the forest
          as he slowly died.
        </p>
        <p>
          The medal clawed at his soul as he kept walking, unbeknownst to him;
          he was in severe pain, but his legs refused to stop, and he died at
          the edge of the forest, where people saw him and retrieved his
          belongings.
        </p>
        <p>And thus, the medal was also brought out into the world.</p>
        <p>Wherever the medal went, it brought misfortune, pain, and death.</p>

        <p>It was cursed.</p>
        <p>The souls of humans were like fuel to the artifact.</p>
        <p>
          People would get intoxicated by the allure of its power only to die
          miserably in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          If that was it, then there was no problem, but the real problem was
          that every person who once owned this artifact caused irreversible
          damage to their surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Conducting mass murder, spreading blood, experimenting with torture...
          all sorts of inhuman acts were performed by the owners of this
          artifact.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not until a group of people called for an expert exorcist to
          help them...
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcist took the artifact in his hands and instantly felt the
          immense dark espera inside the thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He foresaw the danger it posed to both normal humans and exorcists and
          thus decided to seal the artifact and keep it in his home.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't destroy the artifact; he believed as long as someone used it
          limitedly without being consumed by the strange artifact, they could
          use it against demons in the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcist himself had participated in multiple wars and was thus
          not afraid of the curse within the artifact like normal humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          But unfortunately, later the exorcist was killed by demons when they
          ambushed him in his home, destroying his village alongside him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, the sealed artifact was lost; it was nothing more than an
          ordinary medal to normal humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcist, in his time, had only recorded what uses the artifact
          had; he never thought to write down the dangers associated at that
          time.
        </p>

        <p>
          But over the centuries, those records became blurred and not
          believable.
        </p>
        <p>
          And thus, people now only knew about what powers this artifact
          carried, not what dangers it had.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, since most of them had never seen the artifact personally, no
          one believed it existed, and only thought it was just a hoax artifact
          crafted out of someone's imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why Oliver wanted to trade this artifact for money; the risk
          associated was too great considering he was not even strong enough to
          handle a single use of this artifact.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well then. You can collect the money from the reception; she will add
          it to your card. Oh wait, do you even have a bank account to transfer
          the money?"
        </p>
        <p>She asked curiously, to which Oliver shook his head.</p>
        <p>"Then how are you going to access the money?"</p>
        <p>She looked at him speechlessly.</p>
        <p>
          Actually, he himself had not thought of this matter; he thought that
          at the time he purchased something from the auction, he could directly
          hand them the card to deduct the amount.
        </p>
        <p>But having a personal account should ease things in the future...</p>
        <p>He looked at the smirking woman and sighed.</p>
        <p>
          No, he'd rather do it himself than ask her; she was a terrifying
          person, and having less contact with her would be better.
        </p>
        <p>
          'And I don't even know her from the novel, so she must be a minor
          overpowered character.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was sure that he did not want to mess with her lest he fall
          into serious troubles.
        </p>
        <p>"I will see to it myself."</p>
        <p>He said as he started to leave the room.</p>
        <p>But before he could reach out to touch the door, his body froze.</p>
        <p>
          He realized that his body could not move, no matter how much force he
          used; it was frozen still in place.
        </p>
        <p>"Did I allow you to leave?"</p>
