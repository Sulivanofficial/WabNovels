        <h2>Chapter 171 &nbsp;Realization and Panic!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 171</p>
        <p>
          'The enemies have already infiltrated inside through the barrier!'
        </p>
        <p>His heart sank as the realization settled in.</p>
        <p>
          The room felt colder, the walls seeming to close in as he absorbed the
          full weight of the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enemy was undoubtedly powerful, and they were most likely the
          targets.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either it was a kidnapping to threaten the five major clans or simply
          a move to eliminate them all once and for all.
        </p>
        <p>Whatever it was, nothing good was going to happen.</p>
        <p>He turned around quickly and surveyed the hall.</p>
        <p>It was empty.</p>
        <p>Eerily empty aside from them.</p>
        <p>
          "Everyone, let's get inside. The hall is not safe. It is likely that
          the enemy has already entered the barrier surrounding the mountain and
          is heading right where we are."
        </p>
        <p>"What!?" Amber exclaimed in panic.</p>
        <p>
          "We can't waste time; we need to go as deep inside as possible,
          possibly around the mountains, to make the enemy detection as
          difficult as possible."
        </p>
        <p>
          Before they could ask any questions, Evelyn cut in with an equally
          serious voice.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Guys, no time for questions, we should just do as he says. Oliver
          seems sure of it, right, Oliver?" she asked.
        </p>
        <p>"Right, hurry up now!"</p>
        <p>"Fuck!"</p>
        <p>
          The group quickly entered through the door, locking it behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber quickly activated the special lock on the door. It was the only
          entry to enter the mountains from the hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          They quickly started running inside as fast as they could without even
          stopping or looking back for a second.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of their hurried footsteps echoed ominously through the
          narrow corridor, adding to the tension.
        </p>
        <p>"Wait!" Amber shouted, making the group pause.</p>
        <p>"What happened?" Daniel asked her.</p>
        <p>They were close to exiting into the back mountains.</p>
        <p>"Let me set up a special array here," she said.</p>
        <p>"We don't have time for that," Oliver urged.</p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry, it won't take long. It's already been inscribed onto
          scrolls. Just a few moments."
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber quickly kneeled down and took out a special scroll. With some
          modifications to it, the scroll started to glow in a bright color
          before a translucent array formed on the ground and then disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a special trap array. If the enemies follow us, it will
          automatically activate and stop them."
        </p>

        <p>With that, they quickly escaped back into the mountains.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't lead them towards the dorms at all. The dorms were very
          close to the hall, and it was a risky option.
        </p>
        <p>BOOM!</p>
        <p>They heard a loud booming sound behind them.</p>
        <p>
          The group's expressions paled as this was most likely the arrays they
          had set on the door locks.
        </p>
        <p>The enemies were already behind them.</p>
        <p>
          'Fuck! How do they know where we are going?' Oliver cursed as he used
          [Cosmic Void Gaze] to see something terrifying in the distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were three individuals emitting a terrifying black espera
          following the path they had used to escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were following the exact same path as they did, almost as if they
          were somehow tracking them.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Did they put a tracking mark on any of us before coming here?' he
          thought darkly. This was the only possible scenario.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the amount of espera radiating from their bodies alone was
          overbearing. He didn't think that they would be a match for those
          three individuals following after them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Amber." He called out to the girl who looked towards him. "Do you
          know how to activate a teleportation array?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She was the only one among them with some prior knowledge about arrays
          and runes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes trembled slightly as she understood what he was expecting
          from her. However, she could only shake her head in defeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't. It's a very high-level and complex array. I only know a
          little about basic arrays."
        </p>

        <p>'This is almost a dead end,' Oliver thought severely.</p>
        <p>
          "How many life-saving treasures do you guys have? Does any of you have
          a space-attribute or related life-saving artifact?" Oliver questioned
          the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew such rare artifacts existed in this world that could save the
          lives of their users by teleporting them far away from danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have one but it requires to be charged and I did not bother filling
          it with espera." Amber shook her head, she never expected their
          situation to become so worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clearly their clans hadn't thought about it either, Sigfor and Alison
          held a great deal of influence and reputation in the exorcist world,
          it felt natural for the clans to entrust them with their security.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that Alison was a neutral party and did not have a biased
          opinion towards any clan further let the clans trust her more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, no matter how friendly two clans were, they would never
          leave their heirs alone with the other without proper security.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Alison being in the center, it assured clans that the other clans
          would not be able to interfere with their heir's training and
          influence things and everything will be under supervision of Sigfor
          and Alison.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Alison was not present on the mountain at the moment, she had
          gone with Bella to train her special element.
        </p>
        <p>There was a silence in the group as they looked at each other.</p>
        <p>
          "None of you have it?" Oliver sighed. It was understandable. However,
          he did not lose hope, there were many things he could do.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It doesn't look like any of us have them. I have heard of such
          artifacts from my mother. I am sure our clans could have never
          expected that we would be attacked in such a place and that too under
          the eyes of Elder Sigfor and Teacher Alison," Amber said with a wry
          smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Listen… the enemy cannot be avoided. The elder is busy with the
          enemies from outside, and we can only depend on ourselves. Don't
          hesitate to use whatever artifacts you have. We are going to face them
          head-on."
        </p>
        <p>
          The gravity of Oliver's words settled heavily on everyone, their faces
          set with grim determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you have a plan?" Evelyn asked with determined eyes. She was ready
          to fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fuck yes! I ain't scared of no one! Count me in," Daniel smirked and
          said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright then, I don't really call it a plan, but we will be taking
          them on prepared. Assuming there are three intruders, we will engage
          them together in pairs."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait, what if there are more than three? Why only three?" Alphonso
          suddenly asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's brow furrowed as he answered "If there are more than three,
          we'll have to adapt. For now, let's focus on the immediate threat. We
          can reassess if needed."
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 172 &nbsp;Leader of heretic group! Sigfor knows?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 172</p>
        <p>
          "Also, I am just assuming, it's likely that their numbers are around
          just this much. Otherwise, the elder would have long been alerted if
          so many intruders were trying to breach his barrier. And since we have
          already worked together in teams, we all know how it's going to work."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm." Alphonso nodded and glanced at Amber, who also nodded her head
          in agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright then, let's scatter," he said before they all turned to leave
          in different directions while Alphonso went along with Evelyn.
        </p>
        <p>____________</p>
        <p>"A lock array?"</p>
        <p>
          The woman in dark robes from before remarked, amused, as she examined
          the broken door before her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Humph, do they really think that such cheap tactics could deter us
          from pursuing them?" the burly man said arrogantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Childish behavior," commented the man with a short height while he
          inspected the broken door and searched for any hidden traps but found
          none.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can sense them already. They are not far from us," said the short
          man.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Around six individuals—likely around Rank-1 at best from their
          auras," the woman said slyly as she licked her lips in excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "With the three of us working together, even sixty Rank-1 exorcists
          are nothing!" the burly man declared in a deep voice.
        </p>
        <p>"Follow them."</p>

        <p>
          The woman took out a compass and began locating where the exorcist
          with the disaster beast egg was and started following the directions.
        </p>
        <p>"Wait a moment."</p>
        <p>
          The short man in dark robes suddenly stopped them, halting everyone
          along.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What happened?" The burly man couldn't help but frown, he had never
          held an appreciation for the short fellow, not only was this man too
          cowardly but also tended to think about things a bit too much.
        </p>
        <p>He was always on guard and never fought head-on like real men.</p>
        <p>He disdained this man.</p>
        <p>
          "There is a strange-looking array ahead of us. It's been concealed
          well; I would have almost missed it had it not been for the sloppy
          setup. It looks like a trap set up by the exorcists, but due to lack
          of time, they weren't able to fix it up properly."
        </p>
        <p>The short man concluded his analysis.</p>
        <p>
          "This…" the woman paused and waved her hand, sending dark espera
          towards the point where the hidden array was supposed to be. "It's
          indeed a trap."
        </p>
        <p>
          And sure enough, the dark espera quickly revealed the hidden array
          that was drawn on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Humph! So what if it's a trap? In front of brute strength, this is
          nothing but a childish trick!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to admit that the short man was right this time as well,
          the burly man walked right to the array.
        </p>
        <p>"What are you doing? Stop!"</p>
        <p>
          The duo's expression changed when they saw the burly man approach the
          array without a care.
        </p>
        <p>
          While they did not doubt his strength, it was simply a foolish thought
          to just walk right into a trap when they could avoid it or destroy it
          from afar.
        </p>

        <p>"Shut up! Be a man like me. Such tricks are useless against me."</p>
        <p>
          However, just as the burly man confidently stepped inside the array,
          ready to break it apart with his brute force, something no one had
          expected happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          The instant his feet landed on the array, it buzzed to life and was
          instantly activated.
        </p>
        <p>The next moment a dense green light started surrounding the man.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm?" The burly man glanced around in confusion for a moment before a
          strong wave of dizziness washed over him.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>He then instantly collapsed to the ground like a lifeless body.</p>
        <p>"Fuck! This muscle-headed idiot! Did he die?"</p>
        <p>
          The short man cursed, despite having been warned beforehand and even
          after locating the trap, one of them was captured even before they
          could do anything.
        </p>
        <p>What sort of idiotic team was this?</p>
        <p>
          "How did he get into the mission?" the woman asked in a dark voice.
          She couldn't fathom how such a foolish man had managed to get selected
          for such an important mission.
        </p>
        <p>"I don't know!"</p>
        <p>
          "The green light is blocking my senses. I can't tell whether this
          bastard is dead or just unconscious. This fucker has made the mission
          more difficult."
        </p>
        <p>"What do we do now?" the woman questioned.</p>

        <p>"I suggest we destroy the array first," the short man said.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm. Indeed. Even if he's alive right now, when the array is
          destroyed, he will die. We can't leave anything behind. Or…" the woman
          paused before adding.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We deal with exorcists inside first, get the egg and then see if he
          still remains in this state. And even if by then he is still like
          this, we kill him," she suggested.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Such a waste of the sect's resources," the other man snorted in
          disdain.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this burly man had very few equals when it came to brute
          physical force, he was as weak as an ant against poison or spells.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since the muscle-headed man was braindead due to the excessive
          amount of muscles in his brain, he did not realize this and would have
          anyhow died a pitiful death.
        </p>
        <p>Truly an orc-mentality.</p>
        <p>The man thought this and shook his head.</p>
        <p>
          "Let's enter. We have to wrap this up as soon as possible. They are
          close yet scattered all around." The woman said, her robes flickering
          in the wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The one with the disaster beast egg is on the right. I will handle
          him. You go and kill the others. We can't leave behind any witnesses
          only for the Mystic Purge Clan to track us later on," she said before
          quickly heading to the east—the direction where Oliver was supposed to
          be.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tch, fucking bitch, always deciding on her own." the man snorted and
          headed west to eliminate all the others.
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>"Who are you?"</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor asked in a calm, deep voice, the air behind him was trembling
          under his espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, he was facing a man whose face and body were entirely
          covered in a dark cloak with strange patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Judging from your unsightly espera and those patterns, I assume you
          belong to the Unholy Sun Sect?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The black hooded man slowly took off his hood revealing his facial
          features to Sigfor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's pupils dilated as he recognized the man and a surge of hatred
          burst out from his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't even need a moment to recognize the man! n/ô/vel/b//jn dot

        <h2>Chapter 173 &nbsp;Sigfor vs. Leader of Heretics!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 173</p>
        <p>
          The black hooded man slowly took off his hood revealing his facial
          features to Sigfor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are indeed right. I am Jetia, one of the twelve saints of the
          Unholy Sun Sect."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Jetia!" Sigfor's body trembled with rage; he recognized the name very
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only him, in fact, but most of the exorcists would be aware of
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among the exorcists, the list of the twelve saints of the famous
          heretic sects was quite infamous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Among all the heretic groups, the Unholy Sun Sect was particularly
          infamous for its dangerous deeds and the sins they had committed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The number of exorcists that had died at their hands was in the tens
          of thousands, and the innocent civilians and normal humans sacrificed
          by them had long surpassed the hundred thousand mark.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Exorcist Union had already issued warrants for them, and every
          single saint had an enormous bounty placed on their heads. The bounty
          was not only limited to money but also included various treasures.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Unholy Sun Sect had very dark and strict requirements for
          selecting the saints from numerous other heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          They usually had the saint candidates compete; the more terrible a sin
          one commits or the more damage one causes to humanity, the more likely
          they were to become a saint.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jetia, the man in front of him, was the youngest person to ever become
          the saint of the Unholy Sun Sect.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was infamous for planning mass genocides; over twelve towns were
          sacrificed by him to the demons in one night.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had killed many potential exorcists and caused a lot of damage. In
          particular, he was known to hunt down and slaughter specific
          high-ranking targets, most of which were either exorcists or related
          to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The atrocities that Jetia had committed were numerous, and he was to
          be killed on sight; all exorcists from the Union were ordered as such.
        </p>
        <p>He was a heretic that had to be exorcised on sight!</p>
        <p>There was no redemption for him.</p>
        <p>
          He was one of the most wanted criminals of humanity. Sigfor had
          personally heard of his comrades suffering at the hands of Jetia.
        </p>
        <p>
          The death of his comrades' beloved families and his friends further
          fueled his rage.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Very well, Jetia, I have been looking all over for you. To think you
          will deliver yourself to me. Today, I will collect your head and use
          it to set an example for all heretics!"
        </p>
        <p>Sigfor stated firmly as the aura behind him exploded.</p>
        <p>
          Jetia, on the other hand, looked at him mockingly and asked, "I can
          see you have a great deal of hatred towards me. Is it revenge that you
          seek? Did I kill your family or maybe your lover?"
        </p>
        <p>"Bastard, don't dare mention them with your soiled tongue!"</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor waved his hand, and a gray-colored spear made out of espera
          launched toward Jetia at a terrifyingly fast speed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Jetia saw this with narrowed eyes and used his dark espera to counter
          the incoming spear, making it disperse with a loud booming sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground beneath them shook from the impact, dust rising into the
          air like a storm cloud.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't really remember my victims. Too bad for you that the killer
          of your relatives doesn't even remember their names. Hahaha."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor did not say anything; his heart was beating with anger. He
          clasped his hands together, and the next moment, twenty talismans
          floated in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each talisman was inscribed with unknown runes that were pulsing with
          life and espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia frowned when he saw that. Although he didn't know what the
          talismans were for, one thing he knew was that the attack was going to
          be quite dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had already sensed the latter's strength and concluded Sigfor to be
          at the peak of Rank-3—extremely close to breaking through to Rank-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not afford to be careless with this old man, or his head
          would really be sent flying.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I have to get him into the array without him noticing…' he thought
          deeply. Other than that, there was no other way to deter Sigfor for an
          extended period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor was already using his powerful moves right from the start. The
          espera gathering in those talismans was abundantly terrifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          The talismans glowed in a bright red color as ten red beams of espera
          emerged from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor made a hand gesture, his eyes focused and killing intent
          visible in them. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>

        <p>"Go!"</p>
        <p>
          He directly controlled those destructive red streaks with his fingers.
          All of them were aimed at Jetia.
        </p>
        <p>"Humph!"</p>
        <p>
          Jetia sneered, as he made a hand gesture himself, and soon a huge
          hexagonal surface emerged behind his back. The red streaks, when close
          to him, were suddenly diverted and sucked into the hexagonal surface
          behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor was not surprised. He instead took out a huge wooden board from
          his storage artifact and channeled his espera into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wooden board floated in the air, and characters made out of black
          ink started appearing on the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          The board let out a whizzing sound as the hexagonal silhouette reacted
          to the board.
        </p>
        <p>
          It trembled before cracks started appearing in it, and soon it
          crumbled like broken glass.
        </p>
        <p>Sigfor did not allow Jetia to react and attacked him barehanded.</p>
        <p>
          His fists moved with the speed of a striking serpent, each blow aimed
          with deadly precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia quickly dodged the incoming fast punch, but Sigfor did not stop
          and kept attacking.
        </p>
        <p>Soon the two of them were locked in a deadly hand-to-hand combat.</p>
        <p>
          Jetia would retreat back with every attack from Sigfor; he could feel
          Sigfor's explosive strength. His bones were starting to sting in pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had long realized that Sigfor was stronger than him, and to truly
          be able to kill Sigfor, he had been subtly luring the latter towards
          the hidden killer array!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor had a furious look on his face. He was radiating a very strong
          killing intent towards Jetia, wanting to tear him apart as soon as
          possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was in so much rage that he didn't even realize when they had moved
          far away from the mountain that he was supposed to guard and the
          children he was tasked to protect.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cold, calculating look flickered briefly in Jetia's eyes as he
          glanced at the ground beneath them, ensuring they were close to the
          array's activation point.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Die!" Sigfor's fist this time did not miss and connected with the
          man's chest, throwing Jetia back and crashing into the rocky ground.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 174 &nbsp;Killer Array! Sigfor trapped!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 174</p>
        <p>
          He coughed up but quickly made some distance. Blood speckled the
          ground where he stood moments before, his breaths ragged and shallow.
          The attack just now had damaged him, and his internal organs were not
          in good shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor was extremely close to becoming a Rank-4 exorcist, while Jetia
          was still in Rank-3 in terms of strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, Sigfor was most likely a physical exorcist, which
          explained why his punches were so powerful and terrifying.
        </p>
        <p>But he did not show a hint of worry now.</p>
        <p>They were already inside the killer array!</p>
        <p>
          "Haha, I have no words, impressive, you are a very skilled exorcist,"
          Jetia praised, but Sigfor had no mood to listen to him. Just as he was
          about to launch another attack, he froze in his tracks.
        </p>
        <p>
          He instantly focused down below on the ground, his expression changing
          drastically as he saw an array drawn in blood below him appear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sight of crimson lines, pulsating with a sinister glow, made his
          heart skip a beat.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then he heard Jetia's voice, "I truly might have died today at
          your hands if not for the killer array I specially prepared in case of
          emergency. And now look, it did come in handy."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's anger skyrocketed as he released a dense espera to destroy
          the array. However, the moment his espera was released, the array
          sucked all of it quickly, and in return, dark red chains suddenly
          pierced through his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kuh-!" Sigfor grunted as he looked at the red chains with a difficult
          expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chains, cold and unyielding, snaked through his flesh, leaving
          trails of agony in their wake. They were leaking out a dark espera
          while they invaded his defenses, slowly trying to corrupt his pure
          espera. It was clear that if he let this continue, he would be killed
          in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          He exerted a lot of force, and the chains started to rumble. More and
          more chains rose from the array, binding him down. But he kept moving,
          forcefully starting to tear the chains apart, with no care for his own
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia chuckled darkly, "Enjoy the power of my killer array. Even if
          you manage to escape the array, you will no longer be in a state to be
          my match. Wait here for me to return after I finish my mission."
        </p>
        <p>'Mission?' Sigfor's brows furrowed as he heard the word.</p>
        <p>
          'They are targeting the heirs!' He didn't need to think long before he
          realized what they were planning.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Oh? Looks like you have realized our grand plan too? How do you feel
          now?" Jetia asked in a mocking voice, enjoying Sigfor's expressions.
        </p>
        <p>"JETIA! Don't you dare touch the kids!" Sigfor roared in anger.</p>
        <p>'Kids?'</p>
        <p>However, Jetia frowned. What did he mean by that?</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor yelled at him, "Don't dare lay your hands on the kids. Are you
          prepared to face the wrath of the five major clans at once!?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing Sigfor's words, Jetia could not help but shudder slightly.
        </p>
        <p>Wrath of five major clans all at once?</p>
        <p>What was going on?</p>
        <p>
          The sect master had informed him how the exorcist was related to the
          Mystic Purge Clan and that they were going to great lengths to obtain
          the egg.
        </p>
        <p>
          So why would all the five major clans be angry if they only mess with
          one clan?
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever he thought clearly did not make any sense. It was clear to
          him that neither the clans nor the exorcist with the bracelet of the
          demonic ghost were aware of the egg.
        </p>
        <p>
          If they had been aware, then they would not have let the egg leave the
          clan's boundaries in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>"What do you mean?" Jetia asked in a deep voice this time.</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor menacingly struggled with the snake-like grip of the red chains
          as they too struggled to pierce his tougher-than-steel body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't play dumb, you bastard! The heirs of the clan cannot be touched
          by anyone unless they want to be hunted to the ends of the world!"
        </p>
        <p>'Heirs?' Jetia's ears twitched as he heard it.</p>
        <p>'Heirs… kids… the egg…'</p>
        <p>
          It did not take long for Jetia to put two and two together, and he
          soon connected all the dots.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Pfft-! HAHAHA! Who could have thought that things will turn so
          interesting!? HAHAHA!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "To think that the heir of the Mystic Purge Clan would be the one we
          were after. So amusing, so very amusing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia pulled at his hair as his eyes turned crazed, his laughter
          echoing maniacally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only was the heir of the Mystic Purge Clan there, but along with
          that, there were heirs from other major clans as well!
        </p>
        <p>
          All of them in one single place!? It could not be any better than
          this!
        </p>
        <p>
          If he really killed them all, then his fame and name would skyrocket
          all around the world, not just in human territories but also in
          demonic lands too!
        </p>
        <p>
          He might finally become the first to be born as a demon by the grace
          of the higher-up…
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if he did not kill those kids, he could still kidnap them and
          threaten the clan for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, it was incredibly risky to attack an heir. Not only were
          they guarded extremely well, but they also had all sorts of weird
          artifacts with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But looking at Sigfor's deadly expression, he was sure that those kids
          were not under supervision at the moment or were helpless right now.
        </p>
        <p>He had hit a jackpot this time!</p>
        <p>
          To think that the heir of the Mystic Purge Clan would come into the
          possession of the egg of the disaster beast?
        </p>
        <p>How did that even happen?</p>
        <p>
          He didn't know, but he could always interrogate such details later.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well then, I bid you farewell. We might never meet after this…" Jetia
          said as his eyes turned sinister, "Since you will be dead by then!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "STOP RIGHT THERE AND FIGHT ME!" Sigfor could not contain his rage at
          that and tried to delay the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I wonder if they have already killed them or not…" Jetia casually
          wondered. His subordinates did not know about the identities of the
          exorcists. It would be a pity if they had killed them already.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cold sweat broke out across his forehead as dread settled in his
          stomach. Sigfor's expression turned ashen when he heard this. He
          realized that enemies had already infiltrated the barrier without him
          noticing.
        </p>

        <p>
          He felt so pathetic at the moment that he could not express it.
          Despite having strength, he let anger cloud his judgment, leading to
          such a situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If something happened, the clans would not spare him and his master.
          Even their lives would not be worth it to satisfy the damage.
        </p>
        <p>Jetia soon left Sigfor alone and headed towards the mountain.</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor could only frustratedly tear off the chains as more and more of
          them kept coming out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to him not being able to use espera, he could not take out his
          artifacts either. He kept roaring in anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to break out of this killer array and reach back to the kids as
          soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          His master was not present at the moment. It was a truly dangerous
          situation!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked with bated breath at the figure of the woman closing up
          to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His heart raced, and he could feel each thud against his ribs as if it
          were a drumbeat in the still air. He was using [Cosmic Void Gaze] to
          see her coming towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed. The woman was too accurate. It was likely that either he
          and Evelyn had something on them that allowed her to locate them so
          quickly.
        </p>
        <p>She soon reached up to them, and now they were face to face.</p>
        <p>
          He observed her features. The woman had dark hair and black pupils,
          she had thick lips and a chubby face, and she was exuding a sinister
          aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Little kids?" she looked at the two in surprise and then back at the
          compass in her hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The needle quivered, pointing directly at them with unwavering
          certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Say, boy with white hair, you are from the Mystic Purge Clan, right?"
          she asked in a sly tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's right. What business do you have in chasing after us?" Oliver
          paused and asked. He needed more information about the whole
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, little boy, you seem to have picked something accidentally that
          belongs to us. We hold it quite dear to our hearts," she replied with
          a smile.
        </p>
        <p>"Huh?"</p>
        <p>
          It was Oliver's turn to be confused as he looked at her. He did not
          remember taking anything belonging to these heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          And what was that weird looking compass in her hands, she seemed to be
          looking at the compass and then back at them two before her gaze
          finally settled on him with a sharp focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked back at her, he could not understand what was this
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He should be able to remember if he had picked something significant
          for these heretics to follow after them and track them down.
        </p>
        <p>So what was she talking about?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 175 &nbsp;Cornered?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 175</p>
        <p>So what was she talking about?</p>
        <p>
          'Given the compass in her hand, it seems that one of my possessions
          indeed has a connection to them. They must have a tracking rune
          embedded onto it that I might have missed.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver frowned and scanned through his belongings. The items he had
          received from the other clan heirs were mostly pills and potions,
          which he had already consumed, so it could not be that.
        </p>
        <p>It was likely that the thing was still with him.</p>
        <p>
          "What thing might you be referring to?" he asked in a low voice,
          contemplating something.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm?" The woman put a finger under her chin as she smiled. "Well,
          it's no use telling you about it. You will not know of its existence
          after all. I will just have to kill you and search your belongings,
          simple."
        </p>
        <p>
          A cold sweat formed at the nape of his neck, trickling down his spine.
          Oliver felt a chill as he heard her casual words. It did not look like
          she was joking.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you can tell me what I have that belongs to you, then I can return
          it to you and we can settle this matter without bloodshed," he
          suggested.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am afraid that you would need to die since you already saw my face.
          After all, we can't leave any witnesses alive."
        </p>
        <p>She shook her head.</p>
        <p>
          "It seems negotiations have broken down." He sighed, and in the next
          moment, Evelyn lunged at the woman from behind, her katana glowing
          brightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman turned in an instant, blocking Evelyn's katana with a
          folding metal fan.
        </p>
        <p>She exclaimed, "What a surprise! I got totally fooled!"</p>
        <p>
          The corners of her lips curled into a sardonic grin, her eyes gleaming
          with malice. Her tone carried a hint of sarcasm as she remarked on
          their obvious strategy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Evelyn, however, did not stop there. While the woman's metal fan was
          blocking her katana, a wave of bright light shot from her hand,
          directly colliding with the woman.
        </p>
        <p>A loud hissing voice resounded in the quiet surroundings.</p>
        <p>
          As the dust settled, the woman had a dark expression as she stared at
          Evelyn with a mix of shock and anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A light element user? What luck I have? We, the loyal followers of
          demons, loathe the light element the most. We kill any person with a
          light attribute no matter what," she said in a deep voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her skin that was hit by Evelyn's light had a small red burning wound.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman opened up her folding fan and moved towards Evelyn at a
          terrifying speed, appearing in front of the little girl in the blink
          of an eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn barely had time to defend herself before the woman's fan hit
          against her sword.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          A loud ringing sound reverberated through the air as Evelyn was sent
          flying back with a terrible force, making her crash against a nearby
          rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uck-!" She coughed up as pain shot from her spine to the rest of her
          body. The impact was too strong and sudden.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world spun around her, and she struggled to keep her eyes open,
          her vision swimming in and out of focus. Her vision blurred
          momentarily as she saw the woman approaching her.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, before the woman could take any further action, she dodged to
          her side, barely missing a sharp and air-cutting strike from another
          katana.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My, my… such impatience. Little boy, how about you wait for your
          turn? This aunt will thoroughly play with you after I take 'care' of
          your little girlfriend over there."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver automatically ignored her words. Naturally, he had no intention
          of following her words.
        </p>
        <p>
          The katana in his hand moved again. This time, he used his espera and
          three times the physical force than before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman casually blocked his strike with her small metal fan once
          again.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her eyes held a flicker of interest as she said, "Impressive. How are
          you so strong? Are you a physical exorcist? Just at Rank-1, you
          already have such strength."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver ignored what she said and aimed at her again, with four times
          the strength, making the woman narrow her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time she had to apply some force to prevent her wrist from
          dislocating as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your strength increased? What is happening?" she frowned and asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not reply and sent a spear conjured out of water towards
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman clicked her fingers as a blade made of darkness crashed
          against the water spear, consuming the latter and still flying towards
          Oliver at a high speed.
        </p>
        <p>He used [Six Thoughtful Steps of Spirits] and swiftly dodged.</p>
        <p>
          "This basic footwork? You seem to have mastered it as well. Who are
          you? So young and talented, the Mystic Purge Clan indeed has some
          talented exorcists under them," she remarked.
        </p>
        <p>
          The words slid off him like rain on a slick surface, his focus
          unbroken. The basic footwork was being used so seamlessly that she
          thought he had mastered that thing to perfection.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was very curious about the identity of the boy in front of her.
          Just now, the strength he had exerted was not something a Rank-1
          exorcist should have.
        </p>
        <p>Even if he was a physical exorcist, it did not make sense.</p>
        <p>
          She too was a physical exorcist and thus knew the limit to which a
          Rank-1 could persist and exert strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, earlier, she almost felt her joint dislocate under the
          tremendous force.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It seems you don't want to talk? Don't worry, your lovely aunt here
          will make you spill out every little bit of information," she smiled
          evilly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't remember having such an ugly aunt." he said smoothly and the
          woman's expression darkened hearing his words.
        </p>
        <p>A chilling aura emanating from her body directed towards Oliver.</p>

        <p>
          The very air around her seemed to darken, her anger palpable. Oliver
          was calm. He retrieved a longsword from his mind space that he had
          stored before coming to this place and leaped into the air, aiming for
          her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          He grabbed the hilt of the sword and raised his right hand, flicking
          two fingers. A burst of espera condensed into a blue water sword shot
          out, instantly striking the woman and piercing through her body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as he tried to move his sword down on her head, he found he could
          not lift the sword at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          An invisible force had fixed his sword in place, causing his
          complexion to drastically change.
        </p>
        <p>
          He leaped away fiercely, abandoning the sword there. Midair, his hands
          moved swiftly, preparing an elemental attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rain of sharp water needles enveloped him and shot up into the sky.
          His right hand pointed towards the clouds, and the water needles
          followed the direction of his fingertips to quickly combine into a
          colossal water needle, twenty feet in length (about half the length of
          a telephone pole).
        </p>
        <p>
          He used his palm to clutch the large water needle as if it were a
          sword, throwing it towards the woman in black robes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The giant water needle crashed down like heavenly judgment, striking
          the woman in robes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mountain trembled as the water elemental espera spilled out in
          every direction, like wind blades rampaging across the landscapes, the
          tremendous pressure even uprooting some of the weaker trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn, who was watching all this from her place, narrowed her eyes
          when suddenly her pupils dilated as she saw Oliver's expression
          becoming pale.
        </p>
        <p>
          The water needle that was supposed to hit the woman badly was now
          nothing but a puddle floating before her, unable to fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman in black robes slowly lifted her head, showing a ghostly
          expression on her chubby face. Her skin was as pale as a person close
          to death. It was eerie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, something appeared in her hands. It was a long red whip. She
          twisted her hand, and the whip started to tremble violently, wiggling
          from one side to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          An intense killing intent leaked out from her body as Oliver felt a
          huge pressure descending upon his shoulders, almost trying to crush
          him to the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly retreated back, water elemental espera gathering around his
          body like a shield.
        </p>
        <p>
          His speed increased three-fold as he rapidly disappeared to the other
          side of the mountain, while the woman in black robes floated up in the
          air, her eyes as still as dead water.
        </p>
        <p>In the next moment, she too vanished from her spot.</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn was left alone, her body aching badly in multiple places. It
          was clear she had broken bones and had sustained injuries internally.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I have to hurry up… and help Oliver.' she could not help but think
          how he might have been against that heretic, a surge of inexplicable
          anger rose from the depths of her heart, she felt a strong hatred
          towards those demonic followers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything was so peaceful and yet they ruined everything for her and
          her friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          With great difficulty and pain, she reached out to her storage
          artifact, a small brooch, and retrieved a healing potion, starting to
          take small gulps of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her body started to heal slowly. She knew it would take some time
          before she could move again and prayed that Oliver could keep up until
          then.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 176 &nbsp;Destroying her! Gaze of Death!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 176</p>
        <p>
          Oliver soon lured the woman in black robes far from Evelyn. He could
          not fight properly in front of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each step he took was measured, careful, as he led her deeper into the
          forest, away from his injured companion. He could feel the tension in
          the air, every rustle of leaves heightening his senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under his watchful eye, the high and mighty woman descended, which
          suggested that standing in the air, though cool, was quite draining.
        </p>
        <p>"Who are you?"</p>
        <p>
          The woman stared intently at Olivier and asked in a deep voice. This
          time, there was no slyness or playfulness in her tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;Her eyes burned with a desire for answers, reflecting the
          moonlight that barely pierced through the dense canopy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's strength and elemental attacks were different from any Rank-1
          exorcists she had seen before, even surpassing most exorcists in
          Rank-1 alone. She couldn't see through Oliver's identity at the
          moment. When she had earlier tried to sense him in depth, she was
          surprised that she could not see through his real strength at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if he was shrouded in a veil of mystery, concealing layers
          upon layers of hidden power.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not a fool to believe that the espera he was radiating outside
          was all he had; he was deliberately concealing his true powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sheer force behind Oliver's attacks left her in disbelief. How
          could someone so young possess such devastating power? Oliver raised
          his rapier and said, "Shouldn't one introduce oneself first before
          inquiring about the identities of others?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing this, the woman in dark robes showed a cold smile and said,
          "Then let me see what makes you dare to resist!"
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not one to compromise—at least not with someone weaker than
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman tilted the whip in her hand slightly as it extended rapidly
          towards Oliver's direction. It was undoubtedly a special tool for
          exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver dodged the incoming whip by a hair's breadth as it smashed into
          the rocks behind him, shattering them into countless pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Quite destructive…' He looked at the rocks and then back at the red
          whip vibrating violently. He could feel the shockwaves through the
          ground, resonating with the whip's raw power.
        </p>
        <p>
          He noted the pulverized rocks, a grim reminder of the whip's power.
        </p>

        <p>
          The woman whipped in his direction again, intending to immobilize him
          first and then interrogate him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver once again dodged. With Level-5 strength and his footwork
          technique, he could somehow keep up with her moves. It was all thanks
          to his high amount of espera as compared to ordinary Rank-1 exorcists,
          Nadia was already a genius but he who had tenfold espera was a monster
          in the same stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, the woman made a hand gesture as a black talisman flew from
          her end and floated ominously in the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw the talisman and had a bad feeling in his heart. However,
          he did not wait for her to activate the talisman and instead attacked
          her head-on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Putting the rapier in front of his chest, his eyes turned cold. The
          air around him seemed to freeze, and his determination was palpable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman in dark robes narrowed her eyes at his stance, wondering
          what he was doing.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver used the move he was familiar with without hesitation.</p>
        <p>The woman's eyes instantly widened.</p>
        <p>Danger!</p>
        <p>
          The sound of air tearing apart rang in her ears as a purple talisman
          suddenly emerged in front of her and a dark shield materialized.
        </p>
        <p>BANG!</p>
        <p>Crack! Crack!</p>
        <p>
          The woman's heart pounded in her chest as she saw the defensive
          talisman she had been given crumpling under the force of the boy's
          attack. Her breath hitched as she witnessed the unimaginable strength
          he wielded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shield splintered like glass, shards of dark energy dissipating
          into the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was something that could not be torn apart so easily by a mere
          Rank-1 exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>So what was that attack just now?</p>
        <p>
          She felt a true sense of danger from that move earlier, and had it not
          been for her activating the talisman in time, she would not have been
          able to dodge it at all.
        </p>
        <p>"You blocked that?"</p>
        <p>
          She then heard a voice; it was the voice of that white-haired boy.
        </p>

        <p>She looked up and met his eyes and was instantly stunned.</p>
        <p>Death!</p>
        <p>
          Her heart trembled violently as she looked into those eyes as deep as
          the abyss boring into her. The very essence of terror seemed to
          radiate from his gaze, chilling her to the bone.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cold sweat broke out on her forehead, her body paralyzed by an
          unshakable dread.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those eyes seemed to be staring right through her soul. She felt
          naked, as if all her secrets had been revealed under his gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frozen in her place, she could not move her body; it was as if she had
          been pinned by the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          A strong sense of fear had gripped her mind and heart. Her eyes turned
          misty as tears started to stream down uncontrollably.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her nose started to bleed, her hands shook, yet despite all that, she
          could not gather the courage to move an inch.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forest around them seemed to hold its breath, the trees and
          shadows witnesses to the life-and-death struggle unfolding. Every
          instinct screamed at her to flee, but her legs felt like lead, rooted
          to the spot by the oppressive weight of his presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if two giant eyes were staring down at her from the vast
          sky, her fate, her destiny, her life—everything in control of those
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The more she kept staring into those eyes of death, the more pain she
          suffered. Her mind felt like it could explode any moment now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unprecedented sense of fear… this boundless power… this malevolent
          closeness to death…
        </p>
        <p>She felt as if death was in front of her!</p>
        <p>
          However, the black talisman that had been floating in the sky for some
          time suddenly started to emit a crunching sound.
        </p>
        <p>A black ray of light left the talisman, aiming for Oliver.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver sensed the danger behind the black beam and reluctantly
          withdrew his gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          His expression turned fierce; the black beam heading his way was
          life-threatening.
        </p>
        <p>
          This heretic really wanted to kill him. No kidnapping, just
          straight-up assassination.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver jumped backward and instantly made considerable distance, but
          the black beam did not crash into the ground. Instead, it bent at an
          unrealistic angle and traveled towards him.
        </p>
        <p>His eyes narrowed. So that's how it was going to be.</p>
        <p>
          'Come, I have not tested this yet. Let's see how powerful these are,'
          he thought with cold eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand moved in front of him, and the next second, a pitch-black
          flame materialized at the tip of his fingers. The black flame didn't
          stop but kept getting bigger and bigger by the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It grew to become so large that it almost covered his torso behind it.
        </p>
        <p>Holy Flames of Nightmare!</p>
        <p>
          He joined two fingers together, and the pitch-black flames moved
          forward like a super-fast flamethrower towards the black beam coming
          at him!
        </p>
        <p>BOOM!</p>
        <p>
          The black beam and the holy flames of nightmare collided, and the
          impact made the mountain lands tremble. Its sound was so deafening,
          almost as if a fighter jet was passing above their heads.
        </p>
        <p>
          The nearby rocks and grass were instantly destroyed by the collision.
          It was that massive.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's clothes fluttered in the generated impact. However, he stood
          rooted to his spot, his eyes shining as he observed through the smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          His heart thudded in his chest, exhilaration and tension warring
          within him. His lips curled up into a smirk as he saw the destruction
          the flames had caused.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only had the flames instantly decomposed the black beam, but
          furthermore, it was not extinguished even after that and started to
          decompose the surrounding flora.
        </p>
        <p>
          He released the finger seal he was using to control the flames, and
          instantly the flames vanished as if they never existed, leaving behind
          a scene of decay and dread.
        </p>
        <p>Truly nightmarish!</p>
        <p>
          He wasn't merely fighting an enemy; he was asserting his dominance,
          making it clear that he was a force she can't afford to
          play&nbsp;with. The clarity of his purpose was frighteningly evident,
          and it was this clarity that made him so formidable.
        </p>
        <p>"Haah… Haah…"</p>
        <p>
          The woman in dark robes sucked in deep breaths as she panted heavily.
          Her eyes had dried-up tears, and her lips were smeared with her own
          blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          She panted heavily as she tried to calm herself and her mind that was
          on the verge of getting destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was so close to death that her mind was in dismay. Her emotions
          were in a terrible state as she was having a hard time controlling her
          mental state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dark, corrupted thoughts were constantly trying to cloud her mind,
          wanting to consume her as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her sensitive ears picked up the noise of footsteps as a pair of white
          sneakers appeared in her vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          She weakly turned her head up, and the very next moment, started
          vomiting. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>What she saw was a horrifying sight…</p>

        <h2>Chapter 177 &nbsp;The second heretic!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 177</p>
        <p>
          Instead of the human face of the small boy she was expecting to see,
          she saw something sinister… something corrupt.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dark being with no features or expressions was looking down at her
          with a gaze that sent shivers down her spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its very presence seemed to warp the air around it, shadows dancing
          unnaturally at its feet. His entire body radiated a corrupt energy she
          had never felt before, and just being in the presence of that 'thing'
          made her want to kill herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          A torrent of negative, evil, and loathing feelings kept assaulting her
          brain, all of which were trying to convince her to commit suicide
          right in front of the being standing before her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shivering, she lowered her head to his feet, touching the ground with
          her forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "P-Please…" she choked out; her voice could not be any worse at the
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          She regretted ever coming to this place, she regretted ever choosing
          to go east over west, she regretted attacking those kids…
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not need to think anymore, she could feel it inside, that she
          was no match for the power before her. He was not a simple kid, not an
          ordinary exorcist, she knew it. Just the overwhelming power radiating
          from him was enough to make her realize where she stood as things
          were.
        </p>
        <p>
          She should have never come to this place, no, she should have never
          joined the sect. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Had she never joined the sect and turned heretic, she would have never
          come across this being of corruption.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her thoughts were turning against the very sect she belonged to. She
          had realized that other than begging for her life, there were no other
          options left. And even if there were, she could not think about
          anything at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          She begged, drawing out as much of a voice as she could, "P-Please…
          please… s-spare… my life…"
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver looked down at her, his eyes holding a trace of surprise at the
          current state of the woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just before, he had used [Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom]
          intending to take her down by surprise, but she was able to counter
          him in the nick of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he already had other plans, and the moment she looked back at him,
          he had activated the third ability of the [Cosmic Void Gaze] in that
          second.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Enshrouding of Death] instilled a deep fear directly into her mind,
          penetrating all her mental defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, he had used the ability to a deeper and higher extent ever
          since he had acquired these special eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even when he fought his second brother, he had barely used it in case
          he killed him, but this time, since the opponent was a heretic whose
          intention was to kill him, he did not hesitate and used it properly on
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he had dared to care about not killing her, then he could have died
          instead. Thus, he dared not take any risks and used the ability to the
          proper extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind was also feeling quite exhausted after using the ability. He
          would need to give himself some peace of mind to use this ability
          again. It was just too draining!
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked down at the woman with cold eyes. He wanted to know what
          their intentions were and what he had that they used to track him
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          He bent down slowly, crouching to the woman's level as he asked, "If
          you tell me what thing you all are after, then I will spare you."
        </p>
        <p>
          While he had said it in a normal voice, to the woman's ears, it was as
          if someone was shouting inside her mind, trying to shatter her will.
        </p>
        <p>
          She trembled even more. The voice—it was as if countless ants were
          crawling on her back with each word the being spoke, making her
          extremely uncomfortable physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          "E-Egg…" she choked out, wanting to hold onto the hope to live. The
          being had promised her that he would spare her if she told him.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she told him everything, then he would let her live. If she
          revealed everything, then she could live. If she sold out her comrades
          and sect, then perhaps she could even get the being's grace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The desperation in her voice was palpable, each word dripping with
          frantic hope. It could be seen how affected she was that she did not
          even care about anything anymore. She was willing to sacrifice her
          comrades, sell her clan out, and reveal everything just to obtain a
          sliver of his grace. The will to live overshadowed everything for her
          at this moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          She did not care about her sect, nor about her loyalty, or turning
          into a traitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Egg?" Oliver asked further, making the woman's spine crawl as she
          shifted uncomfortably hearing the voice in her ears. It was as if
          someone was scraping at her brain the more she heard his voice.
        </p>
        <p>"B-Beast e-egg…" she said in broken phrases, making him frown.</p>
        <p>"D-Disaster… G-Ghost…"</p>
        <p>
          She kept stammering, her words incoherent as she seemed unable to even
          formulate normal sentences on her own.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Oliver, who processed her words, suddenly widened his eyes
          the moment he heard the word 'Ghost.'
        </p>
        <p>
          How could he not know about the old demonic ghost he had exorcised
          last time in the forest using Abyss energy?
        </p>
        <p>'Fuck!'</p>
        <p>
          He immediately retrieved the storage bracelet from his undercoat and
          quickly threw it in his mind space, cutting off any or all connections
          it had or carried to the outside world, disabling all tracking marks
          or anything associated with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          'So they were tracking using the ghost's storage artifact, some sort
          of beast egg inside the bracelet they are after? What is it?'
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought about what sort of egg it was for them to be so desperate
          about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is it the egg of a disaster beast?' he joined her words and naturally
          arrived at the conclusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Damn, how did the ghost even manage to get his hands on such an egg?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but exclaim internally about the absurdity of
          the situation.
        </p>

        <p>
          He knew how rare and terrifying a disaster beast was from the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          A certain face flashed through his mind when he thought about disaster
          beasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, dispelling the intrusive thoughts and refocusing on
          the task at hand. He decided to think about it later. He had pressing
          matters to deal with at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since they had come personally to such a place, taking a huge risk,
          then it could only mean that the thing he possessed was of very high
          importance to these heretics and their sect.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could not have attacked him inside the Mystic Purge Clan unless
          they had a death wish, so they chose to wait. And when they realized
          he had come far from the clan to the mountains to train, they took
          action.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not know what the woman who was shivering beneath him was
          seeing or feeling, but for a moment he felt that it was a scene
          similar to when Nadia had lost control in the car when she used her
          special eyes to see him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he was curious to know what it was and how it was affecting
          her, he did not have the time to inquire. Evelyn would be here soon,
          and there was another man who was chasing after others.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Wait, weren't there three of them? So why have only two of them
          come?' he frowned as he thought about the third heretic.
        </p>
        <p>
          It looked like he was guarding the entrance to prevent or stop Sigfor
          in case he returned.
        </p>
        <p>Then he had to hurry up.</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the woman trembling under his gaze. His eyes were cold.
          He had no intentions to spare her after she had tried to kill him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not hesitate. His morals had long changed ever since he came
          to this world, shaped by this world's cruel customs. If he wanted to
          live, then he could not spare his enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          A red spear appeared in his hand. He was about to strike when he
          suddenly jumped backward and dodged a terrifyingly fast flying sword
          that grazed past his head.
        </p>
        <p>Drip.</p>
        <p>
          Blood dripped as Oliver slowly touched his forehead. He had just
          dodged a deadly attack from the flying sword, and he realized that his
          forehead was starting to bleed from the small contact.
        </p>
        <p>
          His skin, which was as tough as stone, was almost sliced like that,
          and so easily? Had he been a moment late, his head would have been
          sent flying.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned his head towards his right, where he heard footsteps from.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes widened as he saw a short man in dark robes walking towards
          him. The man had a wrinkled face and gray beard, looking quite old.
          However, his eyes were sharp and vigorous.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man wielded a gleaming silver sword, its blade inscribed with
          ancient runes that seemed to pulse with a faint, ominous light.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not that Oliver was looking at the man's aged face, but what he
          had in his hands.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 178 &nbsp;Ruthless Traitor?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 178</p>
        <p>
          It was not that Oliver was looking at the man's aged face, but at what
          he had in his hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his right hand was Alphonso, who was being dragged by his neck, and
          in his left hand was Amber, who was being dragged along by her hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's heart sank, his mind racing as he took in their brutalized
          forms. Oliver's pupils shook slightly as his heart raced faster and
          faster with every passing second, looking at their state.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were riddled with deep wounds all over their bodies. Their hands
          and legs were covered in purple bruises, and Alphonso's face was
          almost ruined with deep gashes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso was unconscious while Amber was letting out pitiful sobs,
          being dragged along by the man who held her by her hair tightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man, looking at Oliver's face, grinned as he stretched his hand,
          pulling Amber's hair more tightly, making her cry out loud.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man's grin widened, reveling in her pain, his eyes gleaming with
          sadistic pleasure. He seemed to be enjoying her cries as he didn't
          loosen his grip in the slightest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How's it? What do you feel? Are you angry?" the old man raised his
          head and asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver remained calm on the surface, but his heart was in turmoil,
          raging with intense emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tch, tch… not a sliver of change?" the short man said, "Are all of
          you lot from Mystic Purge Clan born without a heart?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not say anything; he knew better than to ask the man to
          stop. The short man would only do it more and worse the more he tried
          to ask or threaten him, so he did not say anything and maintained a
          poker face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here is your friend screaming out her lungs, and yet you look so
          heartless. Not a change in expression? I say this: you all from the
          Mystic Purge Clan do not care about anything other than power? Quite
          the demons you are yourselves, yet calling yourselves exorcists? What
          a joke!"
        </p>

        <p>
          The man laughed as he mocked the clan. Oliver could feel that this man
          did not care about the clans at all and bore particular hatred towards
          his clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here this old man was expecting to see great expressions on your face
          using your friends here, but it seems I made a mistake… even their
          children are just as insane as them, huh." The man clicked his tongue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver maintained his calm eyes as he looked at Amber crying more and
          more while the old man kept adjusting his grip on her hair, torturing
          her more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          He noticed how she was having difficulty raising her arms, suspecting
          that he had broken them or paralyzed her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She tried to adjust her position to lessen the pain somehow, but the
          old man didn't give her any leeway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes turned deadly when he saw the smile on the old man's
          face. However, the old man had yet to notice this change.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So? Did I take her with me for nothing then? Is she nothing more than
          a tool for you, heir of Mystic Purge Clan?" the old man questioned
          with a bold smile and wide eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver maintained an expressionless face as he replied in a calm tone,
          "Indeed, she's nothing but a resource. Her life or death does not
          affect me or my plans. Kill her if you want."
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber's sobs halted, her eyes widening in disbelief at his cold
          declaration. The smile on the old man's face widened as Amber, who was
          weakly struggling in his grasp, slowly looked his way.
        </p>
        <p>
          He avoided her gaze as if she didn't matter or exist and kept his
          focus on the old man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber's eyes had a look of absolute betrayal in them as she looked at
          the guy whom she once considered a friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          She saw how he was not even bothered to meet her gaze, signifying her
          worth in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mix of despair and rage washed over her, her spirit breaking further
          with each passing second. A look of despair and hatred enveloped her
          as she looked at him before putting her head down, mumbling in a
          hushed tone.
        </p>
        <p>"Bastard…"</p>

        <p>
          However, she kept the tone to herself, not letting anyone hear her.
          Her head low as she didn't bother anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Impressive, bravo… such ruthlessness and decisiveness at this age. I
          can not imagine how you will turn out to be in the future."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not speak; he had said those harsh words intentionally. He
          knew if he showed even a moment's worth of weakness, the clever old
          man would definitely use the two of them as bait to threaten him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had told him to kill Amber if he wanted because he wanted to make
          the old man completely lose interest in her. After all, if he was not
          going to be intimidated by hostages, then there was not really much of
          a point for the old man in killing the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          The short-heighted old man must have already interrogated the two
          about their identities, and both of them being the heirs of the two
          major clans definitely put him under pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would not be much advantageous for him to kill the two heirs when
          he could have his sect or whoever his superior was exchange their
          lives for ransom and the lives of their captured comrades.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, if he were to really kill them, then he could only wait for his
          death being chased by the forces of the two major clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          They would not let him rest at all and definitely capture him even if
          he ran to the end of the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          What would wait for him then would be endless torture or a painful
          exorcism.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the man had not much of an incentive to take their lives. Oliver
          did not mind playing his character.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man shivered as he muttered to himself. It was then his gaze
          traveled to the woman in black robes kneeling with her head touching
          the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, "This bitch had always been too arrogant, always
          looking down on others, and see what she has come to?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man clicked his tongue before adding, "However, she had some
          skills, at least enough to not be defeated by a Rank-1 exorcist at
          all. For her to be reduced to this state…"
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze hardened, suspicion evident as he studied Oliver's composed
          demeanor. His eyes turned sinister as he gazed at the calm Oliver and
          asked, "What did you do to her, boy?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver seemed unfazed by the dense killing intent that emerged from
          the old man towards him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, he spoke something else, completely unrelated to anything.
        </p>
        <p>"You seem to have some history with the Mystic Purge Clan."</p>
        <p>
          The old man's mocking expression crumpled when he heard his words
          before the grin on his face disappeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing this, Oliver further said, "Did the exorcists of my clan beat
          your old bones to death?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man's eyes contained a ferocious glint when he heard this.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before he could say anything, Oliver further added, as if saying
          to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Doubtful. Had you encountered an official clan member, with your
          measly strength, you would not have escaped to live."
        </p>
        <p>
          At this moment, the old man's eyes were bloodshot as he heard Oliver's
          provocative sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then this could only mean that you were defeated by a trainee, an
          unofficial member, one of the weakest in the clan." Oliver finally
          concluded and glanced at the old man, only to see the latter shaking
          in anger with red, angry eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This condescending tone… with that expressionless face, you are
          indeed the heir of the Mystic Purge Clan. Indeed, long ago, I was
          humiliated by one of your kin. But today, I will pay back the
          humiliation tenfold!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man threw Amber and Alphonso with force, sending them crashing
          to the sides, which made Oliver heave a sigh of relief secretly.
        </p>
        <p>He had managed to distract the old man completely from the two.</p>
        <p>
          Now they were face-to-face. He could tell that the old man was
          stronger than the woman but was very cautious; he was hiding his aura
          as much as he could.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Today, I will cut off your head, take it out, and sacrifice your
          blood to demons. Only then will my revenge be considered complete."
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man said in a hoarse voice as he drew out a thin and sharp
          sword from his storage bracelet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver became alert as he felt a sense of danger from the old man, but
          upon closer look, he found out that the old man had a few openings in
          his stance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet a heavy, inexplicable sense of foreboding settled in his chest. He
          could easily exploit those openings if they clashed, but for some
          reason, his chest grew heavy.
        </p>
        <p>'So then what is this sense of crisis?'</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but feel suspicious about the confidence the old man
          had when facing him with his level of sword skills.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 179 &nbsp;Poison?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 179</p>
        <p>'So then what is this sense of crisis?'</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but feel suspicious about the confidence the old man
          had when facing him with his level of sword skills.
        </p>
        <p>"Cough-!" He suddenly started coughing blood.</p>
        <p>
          "Hahahaha…" the old man's eerie laughter rang out in the silent
          mountains as he disappeared from his previous spot and reappeared in
          front of him.
        </p>
        <p>Swish! Bang!</p>
        <p>"Ugh!"</p>
        <p>
          The old man swung his sword, slicing at Oliver's arm. He tried to
          dodge, but in the next instant, a fierce and strong kick connected
          with his abdomen, sending him flying backward.
        </p>
        <p>Crack!</p>
        <p>
          Agony shot through his chest as he crashed into the ground, feeling
          his ribs snap under the force. His ribs hurt as he groaned, his vision
          suddenly becoming blurry too.
        </p>
        <p>'Poison? Did he poison me?'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver quickly realized this, his mind instantly going to the small
          gash on his forehead that the old man had inflicted upon him with that
          flying sword.
        </p>
        <p>'That sword was coated with hidden poison!'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver realized this, albeit late. The poison had paralyzing
          properties, his body was starting to turn numb to sensations,
          everything feeling foreign to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had earlier seen with his eyes that both Amber and Alphonso were
          immobile and barely twitching. He should have suspected it at that
          moment only that the old man was using dirty tricks.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haah… Haah…" He started to take deep breaths to calm his nerves. Now
          was not the time, he had to destroy the poison first. He could justify
          that sense of crisis from before now.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not allowed to think much as the old man was now directly in
          front of him, looking down at his miserable state.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What a view. I wish I could record the moment, but sadly this old man
          forgot his device back at the headquarters. Ah, what a pity!"
        </p>

        <p>
          The old man stomped his foot directly on his chest, further making
          blood splutter from his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I wonder how your clan would react seeing their heir in such a
          miserable sta—"
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man instantly backed off as a huge icicle crashed directly
          where he was standing, obliterating the rocks and making a deep hole
          in the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned his head and saw, on a nearby rocky cliff, a girl with short
          silvery white hair standing, looking at him expressionlessly.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          The old man twisted his body and blocked a sword coming from behind
          him.
        </p>
        <p>He saw a black-haired boy looking into his eyes with anger.</p>
        <p>"How dare you hurt my pal?"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel's voice was low and dangerous, his eyes burning with fury as he
          held his ground. The boy said in a scary tone as he parried the old
          man's sword away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now who are you, brat?" the old man asked in an annoyed tone. He was
          so close to killing that arrogant bastard, and now out of nowhere,
          another brat appeared.
        </p>
        <p>"I am Daniel, the one who will defeat you!"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel yelled as he jumped onto the old man, pushing the old man back
          momentarily before the old man swung his sword forward with force,
          throwing him back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uck!" Daniel clenched his teeth. Just now, the force from that old
          man's strike made his wrist hurt badly.
        </p>
        <p>'This old man is definitely higher-ranked than us all…'</p>
        <p>
          Daniel's aura grew, as a fighting spirit ignited in his eyes, a broad
          grin on his face as thunder started to crackle all around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let me test my full power," he said and instantly disappeared from
          his spot with a speed so fast that the old man had to narrow his eyes
          to look around.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only catch the silhouette of the brat from time to time,
          making him angry.
        </p>
        <p>
          How could he, a Rank-2, not be able to keep up with the movements of a
          Rank-1?
        </p>
        <p>This was absurd!</p>
        <p>
          While the old man had reached the limit of his talent, he was not so
          terrible to be unable to keep up with a Rank-1 exorcist…
        </p>

        <p>
          He smashed his foot into the ground, making the ground close to him
          tremble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel did not delay and appeared right next to the old man, swinging
          his sword as if it was an extension of his hand.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          The old man parried back in the moment, making Daniel quickly back
          away and appear on the other side of the old man.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          The old heretic, clad in a white shirt, was as fast as a specter with
          his sword gleaming coldly under the night sky, while Daniel, like a
          crane, seemed slower than the old man but always managed to evade his
          attacks with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if Daniel was able to read all the old man's moves instantly
          and find openings to strike at the old man, making the latter more
          furious.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Oliver had said before, the old man had subpar sword skills and his
          stance had many openings. With such lacking talent, there was no way
          he could just brute force his way through everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Faced with Daniel, a sword prodigy, it was natural that his attacks
          were easily readable.
        </p>
        <p>"Damn it!"</p>
        <p>
          The old man cursed and in the next instant, he took out a black bag
          with some liquid inside it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A terrible stench covered the surroundings as soon as the bag was
          taken out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I did not want to use this, but I am short on time…" he looked
          towards Daniel and smiled coldly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did you think that my main weapon was a sword? If so, then you are
          wrong. Poison, my specialty is poison. I am an alchemist, not a
          fighter, having concocted some of the deadliest poisons of the Unholy
          Sun Sect. The moment I use this, you can only beg for death."
        </p>
        <p>The old man chuckled darkly.</p>
        <p>
          "Fuck! Old bastard, are you going to play dirty!?" Daniel exclaimed in
          anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dirty?" The old man scoffed as he said, "There's nothing dirty about
          it, brat. I am an alchemist, and this is how we fight. It's your fault
          for being so pathetic to be fooled."
        </p>
        <p>Daniel gritted his teeth as he spat at the old man's tricks.</p>

        <p>
          "Fucking old bastard! ALL OF YOU OLD BASTARDS ARE SO HATEFUL!!" Daniel
          said, as his experience with old people had been the worst.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know what you are blabbering. It looks like the fear of death
          has made you go crazy, hahaha."
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man ignored Daniel and looked at the short cliff. The girl was
          not there; he suspected that she was coming down to help.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not going to wait and kill these two here, retrieve the egg,
          and then finish the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would kidnap the others and have the clans fight with each other
          and ensure chaos.
        </p>
        <p>
          He threw the black bag towards where Daniel was standing, and in a
          second, a huge black smoke exploded from the bag, as a blackish fluid
          covered the ground, instantly melting the rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The acrid stench of burning rock filled the air, the poison eating
          away at the landscape like acid. Daniel jumped backward and started to
          get away from the black fog that was quickly spreading outwards, his
          speed slower as the fog approached him from behind.
        </p>
        <p>"Now that's one taken care of, let's resume where we were."</p>
        <p>Splatter!</p>
        <p>A fountain of blood erupted.</p>
        <p>
          Before the old man could turn around and face, a sharp pain assaulted
          his chest. He slowly looked down below before turning around.
        </p>
        <p>
          His vision blurred as the world tilted, darkness closing in from the
          edges. He had an expression of disbelief as darkness overtook his
          sight, even while dying he could only mutter one word.
        </p>
        <p>"How…?"</p>
        <p>
          Behind him stood Oliver, who currently wore an expressionless facade,
          not a single trace of the poison from before visible on his body or
          face.
        </p>
        <p>"A dead man doesn't need to know."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver said in a cold voice as he twisted his sword in the old man's
          heart, finishing him in a single strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          He watched as the old man fell to the ground like a puppet with
          strings cut.
        </p>
        <p>
          He bent down and picked up the man's storage bracelet. This time, he
          stored the bracelet in his mindspace in case someone came after him
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed as he looked ahead at the black mist covering the sky. He
          did not seem too troubled by the poisonous fog.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes scanned the area, calculating his next move with precise
          focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed as he looked ahead at the black mist covering the sky, he
          did not look to be too troubled by the poisonous fog.
        </p>
        <p>And he had the reason to be.</p>
        <p>
          With Abyss energy residing inside him, how can ordinary poison of some
          old maniac hurt him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier when he had realized that he had been poisoned, he immediately
          used Abyss energy and devoured the whole poison quickly, making him
          free of any ailments or negative effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, his ribs still hurt from the impact so he consumed a health
          potion while he watched Daniel battle the old heretic.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 180 &nbsp;Where were Evelyn and Nadia?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 180</p>
        <p>
          He was quite impressed with Daniel's talent with swords. Despite the
          enemy being a Rank-2, he did not fear him and kept fighting,
          exploiting the latter's blind spots.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          A pitch-black flame emerged from his left hand as he pointed a finger
          toward the black smog, shooting a small fire lance toward the screen
          of poison.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lance cut through the air, a streak of darkness against the dense
          fog. The poison was flammable, and the fire instantly spread out,
          consuming the fog within seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          When he saw the fog was completely gone, he cut off his espera, and
          the black flames disappeared, leaving behind a barren and destroyed
          land.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't stop and walked up to the old man's dead body. He could see
          a trace of dark espera, which did not belong to humans, leaking out of
          his dead body.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he let the dead body stay longer, it might give birth to demonic
          beasts in the ecosystem of this mountain, contaminating the
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was also why exorcists had a duty to deal with the dead bodies of
          these heretics after the fight, to prevent any unforeseeable events in
          the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver placed his palm against the old man's chest, and reddish-black
          energy erupted from his hand, instantly enveloping the old man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within seconds, the old man's body disappeared from the face of the
          earth forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          A strange warmth surged through his veins, a faint pulse of power
          igniting within him. A warm feeling surged in his heart as he felt a
          burst of power in his body. Clenching his fists, he felt as if his
          strength had increased again.
        </p>
        <p>
          He saw Daniel lying far away and reached up to him. Upon closer
          inspection, it did not seem like he was affected much by the poison;
          he must have evaded the fog by a hair's breadth, rendering him
          unconscious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver picked him up, placed him underneath some leaves and bushes,
          and went ahead to carry Alphonso and Amber as well.
        </p>
        <p>BOOM!</p>
        <p>
          Just as he was settling them, he heard a loud banging sound from the
          opposite direction.
        </p>

        <p>
          He instantly moved in the direction of the sound. In the distance, he
          could see another terrible scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn and Nadia were both kneeling and bleeding, and in front of them
          was a burly man with red patches all over his face. He looked
          repulsive and sinister.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man's eyes gleamed with malice, his twisted smile revealing a set
          of yellowed teeth. The man was barehanded and had an ugly expression
          on his face. Oliver could see the man's arms burned with ice piercing
          his legs.
        </p>
        <p>'So they were here.'</p>
        <p>
          He had been wondering where they had gone and why it took them so
          long, and here they were, engaging with the third heretic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver furrowed his brows. The burly man had a powerful aura, and
          murderous intent filled his surroundings as he walked.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a second, the man disappeared from his spot and reappeared behind
          Evelyn, his fist connecting with her back as she screamed in pain.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver did not wait and closed in on their location.</p>
        <p>Another sword appeared in his hand as he jumped down.</p>
        <p>Tap.</p>
        <p>The burly man turned around as he heard the sound of tapping.</p>
        <p>He saw Oliver standing with a sword.</p>
        <p>
          "Oliver!" Evelyn's eyes widened. She could not help but feel
          regretful; not only had she been stopped by this heretic and was
          almost losing, but since he had come here alone, did it mean that the
          woman was dealt with?
        </p>
        <p>
          She could only suppress her doubts in her mind and focus on the man.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oliver, watch out! This man has unnatural strength. Stay back and
          attack from a distance—engaging him up close would be too risky." she
          warned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, who heard her, nodded. He had already expected as much. When
          he used his special eyes to scan the burly man, he found that the man
          had very low espera compared to the other two heretics…
        </p>
        <p>
          It was likely he was also a physical exorcist but didn't focus on
          training his espera, only on his brute force.
        </p>

        <p>
          This, along with the bulging body of the man, was enough to make him
          aware of his strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          The burly man furrowed his brows and said, "When we entered, there
          were supposed to be six of you detestable exorcists. Now there are
          three of you here, but where are the two who came along with me? They
          should have finished while I was sleeping."
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing his words, Oliver raised a brow as he remembered the trap
          array Amber had set up. It looked like the man was trapped in the
          array formation and was asleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver put one hand behind his back as he looked at the towering man.
        </p>
        <p>
          He spoke, "If you are searching for your two heretic teammates, then
          you shouldn't. They have already been exorcised, and you're next."
        </p>
        <p>The man's face darkened, his fists clenching at the news.</p>
        <p>
          The man's eyes narrowed as he heard the words of the kid before him.
          He did not doubt his words; they were nowhere to be seen, and he was
          unable to detect them either.
        </p>
        <p>Were they actually exorcised by these exorcist brats!?</p>
        <p>
          Fumes started to rise from his head as his face turned even redder
          than it already was. He looked extremely angry at that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Keep scowling like that, and your face might just get stuck that way.
          Though, I doubt anyone would notice the difference." Oliver said
          calmly, but his words sounded extremely provocative to the burly man's
          ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Like a bull, he charged straight at Oliver, no longer caring about
          anything. He did not care about the old man at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that woman, she was supposed to be his in the future, and now this
          white-haired brat said that she was exorcised? He did not hold back as
          a flood of anger clouded his mind instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver took a deep breath, seeing the man charging right at him. If he
          was hit by the man, even he did not know how many bones he would break
          in his body.
        </p>
        <p>However, he had no intention of taking him head-on.</p>
        <p>
          "What's wrong? All those muscles slowing you down? Or are you just too
          heavy to keep up?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver snickered as he provoked the charging bull even more while he
          himself ran further and further from Evelyn and Nadia, drawing the man
          out of range.
        </p>
        <p>
          With his agility, he did not face much issue keeping a minimal
          distance between them.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking back, he nearly cursed when he saw the burly man closing in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Damn! Even with his level 5 strength, he couldn't keep up! Was this
          the true gap between the strength of a Rank-1 and Rank-2 exorcist?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver doubted. These heretics were just handymen; they were partial
          Ranks, not true Rank exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power between the two was incomparable. It was only because of
          this that he was able to exorcise the two heretics higher-ranked than
          him with some effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, if heretics truly started to achieve the power of true
          Ranks like exorcists, wouldn't the demons easily cause humanity too
          much damage?
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that dark espera was not compatible with the espera training
          methods of humans was already widely known, and this was also why the
          major clans didn't pay too much attention to the pesky sects, given
          their hands were already full with demons.
        </p>
        <p>"You're dead for laying a hand on her!"</p>
        <p>The man roared behind him, sending tremors through his ears.</p>
        <p>"She's his? That woman?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver thought of the woman. He had not exorcised her; he was
          interrupted by the old man before that, so he did not know where the
          woman went.
        </p>
        <p>
          Given her mental state, Oliver was not worried that she would cause
          more trouble for him later.
        </p>
        <p>He could search for her after dealing with all these heretics.</p>
        <p>
          "That woman? I exorcised her myself. You should've seen her
          face—begging for your revenge, but it was too late."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not really know the actual relationship between the two of
          them, but since the man said she was his woman, he assumed they were
          lovers or something.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Face me, you spineless coward!" the man yelled from behind. He was
          further outraged when he heard his words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did that mean that she also harbored the same feelings for him as he
          did for her?
        </p>
        <p>If so, why would she always avoid him before?</p>
        <p>
          His orcish mind could not understand, but since he had marked her as
          his woman in his mind, he would slaughter all those present.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would give the brat running ahead of him the most brutal and
          painful death ever for hurting his woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, just as he was chasing Oliver, he saw the kid suddenly stop
          ahead of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not stop and sped up, charging right toward Oliver, intending
          to destroy him.
        </p>
        <p>
          A predatory grin spread across his face, sensing victory was near.
