        <h2>Chapter 141 &nbsp;Balancing Water and Light element!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 141</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn listened to his explanations and nodded, "I got it. Then fill
          it up with your espera. I will try to maintain the balance
          afterwards."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded back and placed his hand against the smooth surface of
          the white-colored talisman. Slowly, his hand started to channel his
          water-attributed espera into the paper beneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          A warm current flowed from his hand to the paper talisman as he filled
          it halfway.
        </p>
        <p>
          After making sure it was filled halfway, he retreated his hand and
          looked at Evelyn, who was beside him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noticing his signal, she went up to the talisman and placed her palm
          above the paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Closing her eyes, she moved the light-attributed espera inside her
          body into the paper talisman, slowly filling the already half-filled
          talisman.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could sense the circuits inside the talisman as she filled it with
          her espera. Her light-attributed espera had already started to react
          with the espera present from earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The task required a delicate balance of focus and control, a harmony
          between the elements that was difficult to achieve. She could feel the
          subtle push and pull of energies within the talisman, like trying to
          balance on a tightrope where the slightest misstep could result in
          failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did her best to control the amount she was channeling and how
          properly the circuit was being filled. An overdose of her espera might
          just destroy everything on the talisman, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her brows knitted in concentration as a bead of sweat trickled down
          her forehead. This was far more challenging than she had anticipated.
          She tried to stir her espera within the talisman, calculating a way to
          completely fill it without causing a reaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could feel that the water element was especially sensitive and
          would react turbulently to external changes or any stimulus provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was actually stuck. She had already filled the espera as much as
          she could without disturbing the already present water espera too
          much.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now she felt that if she sent any more inside, it would cause a
          huge reaction. Thus, she was slowly trying to stir her espera that she
          had already sent into the talisman. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          By moving them in the circuits, she was trying to calculate a way for
          her to completely fill the talisman without breaking it or causing it
          to react adversely with the water element.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at her frowning while closing her eyes, Oliver could somewhat
          guess her struggle, understanding the difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even he was aware of how difficult the task Sigfor gave them was. It
          would be a miracle if someone managed to complete it in a single try.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn still lacked the proper control of her espera; there was no way
          she could do it in one day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, she was dealing with the water element espera. The
          water-attributed espera was especially sensitive among the basic
          common elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wind and water were notably more sensitive compared to earth and fire
          elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the slightest change would cause a huge reaction. He could
          understand her situation at the moment without her telling him
          anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had she been paired up with someone who had a robust element like
          Amber or Daniel, or maybe Nadia as well, she might have had an easier
          time trying to balance it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But with her light-attributed espera, which was already quite a potent
          element in essence, his water-attributed espera would serve as a tough
          obstacle in her course.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light element would definitely try to establish dominance
          immediately over the basic elements, so her main task was to control
          the potency and stop it from immediately trying to overpower the water
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying to make a hybrid element coexist with a basic element was quite
          difficult. It was an evident fact that no exorcist could deny.
        </p>
        <p>
          So it would take her some time to even think of figuring this out on
          her own and applying it in person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was already aware of the theory and logic behind this. He could
          just tell her and help her when implementing it physically. It would
          not only hasten up the process by a whole lot but also help them get
          more time to decide on an elemental attack as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he had no such intentions. In fact, he wanted her to spend as much
          time as she wanted to figure out the solution on her own instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          This would help her develop her critical thinking skills as well as
          give him more time to get in contact with her.
        </p>
        <p>It was simply killing two birds with one stone.</p>
        <p>
          Also, if he kept helping her like this every now and then, he would
          only be hindering her own self-growth in the end and messing things up
          more than they already were.
        </p>

        <p>Crack!</p>
        <p>
          A sharp cracking sound echoed as the talisman she was applying espera
          to started to show signs of cracks. The paper had started to develop
          visible cracks as if it were a rock fracturing slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh no!" Evelyn panicked a little as she lost control over the
          talisman. Before she could do anything, a large thunderous sound
          blasted through the surroundings as the talisman released all its
          stored energy.
        </p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          The talisman released all the excessive energy inside and burst out
          with a hot wave of espera, forcing her to retreat backward due to the
          sheer force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her face would have charred black normally due to the sudden explosion
          and closeness of the blast before her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as the smoke started to settle down, she slowly opened her
          eyes only to see a giant water wall floating in front of her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tilting her face sideways, she noticed Oliver with his palm facing her
          direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He used the water barrier…' she thought as she glanced back at the
          water shield, a wall of water in front of her face. It was shimmering
          blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          This water wall had saved her face from getting blackened. She looked
          at the water wall slowly shifting in form, wiggling as if it was
          having difficulty maintaining the shape of the wall of water.
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched as it crumbled before dripping down on the ground in front
          of her after absorbing the impact from the little blast.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thanks…" she whispered, feeling a little shy now that she had made
          the blunder.
        </p>
        <p>Her face heated up as a red blush crept up to her cheeks.</p>
        <p>
          She did not expect to directly detonate the talisman and lose control.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was expecting the control over the talisman to be as easy as it
          was when she was doing it individually.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, she had thought it wrong. It seemed that earlier it was easy
          only because she was supplying purely light-attributed espera towards
          the talisman, and it was not having any obstruction in the circuits.
        </p>

        <p>
          But in the end, the difference when it came to applying and balancing
          the espera was huge!
        </p>
        <p>
          So huge that she could not believe it. Despite all her efforts, she
          was not able to control the flow and in the end lost it, leading to
          such changes.

        <p>
          "Haah… it was honestly hard. Be careful, you are next." She shook her
          head and warned him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking out another talisman, she started to fill it halfway with her
          light-attributed espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          After double-checking the talisman, she handed it over to Oliver, who
          was sitting beside her watching her fill it.
        </p>
        <p>"Here you go!"</p>
        <p>He received the talisman and observed it without doing anything.</p>
        <p>
          It went on for a minute, so she could not help but ask curiously,
          albeit a little confused as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What are you doing?" she paused before adding, "You have been staring
          at it."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, it was nothing. I will start right now."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver quickly shrugged it off as nothing and went to work directly.
          He started to channel his water-attributed espera inside the circuits
          of the talisman in a steady flow, fluently controlling the element.
        </p>
        <p>
          His flow was steady and controlled. Secretly, he was using [Cosmic
          Void Gaze] to observe the talisman's intricate circuits.
        </p>
        <p>
          With its help, he was able to very minutely observe the intricacies of
          the complex circuit to the very bottom.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was using the [Cosmic Void Gaze] on a suppressed level just to
          graze off the details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver began channeling his water espera into the talisman's circuits,
          his flow steady and controlled. Secretly, he was using [Cosmic Void
          Gaze] to observe the talisman's intricate circuits.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ability allowed him to see the complex patterns in detail, giving
          him a significant advantage. He used it discreetly, the same way he
          did in the clan market while buying supplies.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Cosmic Void Gaze] provided an extremely detailed map of the
          talisman's circuits, allowing him to channel his espera precisely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The intricate designs of the talisman unfolded before his eyes, each
          line and curve revealing the secrets of its construction. The
          knowledge he gained from this sight was invaluable, giving him
          insights that would otherwise take a significant amount of time for
          someone to normally master.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was at the same level he used to survey the clan market while
          buying useful stuff for himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The level he used to see through was enough to give him an extremely
          detailed map of the circuits in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I can really do well with talismans using the special eyes. I will
          definitely have an edge over others,' he thought, a small smile
          playing on his lips as he worked.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 142 &nbsp;Someone is impatient?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 142</p>
        <p>
          'I can really do well with talismans using the special eyes. I will
          definitely have an edge over others,' he thought, a small smile
          playing on his lips as he worked. His fingers moved with precision,
          tracing the intricate patterns on the talisman.
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought to himself while slowly filling it with his
          water-attributed espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cool, blue energy flowed from his fingertips, intertwining with
          the delicate lines of the talisman.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was able to easily coordinate with the light-attributed espera on
          his first try.
        </p>
        <p>
          A soft glow emanated from the talisman, the two energies merging
          seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He pondered for a moment as he saw the espera combining with the two
          attributes balancing out.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light and water danced together, a harmonious blend that filled
          him with satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          'He is doing good…' Evelyn sensed the flow and felt it was more
          controlled; he was doing better than her while manipulating the
          talisman. She watched, her eyes narrowing in concentration as she
          analyzed the smooth movements of his espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had a bewildered expression as she noticed his flawless control.
          He did not rank first during the mountain climb test for nothing,
          after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm?" she noticed as he suddenly let go of the flow. The talisman's
          glow flickered, the delicate balance disrupted.
        </p>
        <p>'What?'</p>
        <p>
          Her eyes narrowed as she looked at the abrupt loss of control he
          suddenly displayed. Her brow furrowed, confusion etched across her
          face.
        </p>
        <p>Why did he suddenly lose control?</p>

        <p>
          It was too sudden. One moment prior, he was masterfully manipulating
          the espera flow, and the next instant, he abruptly lost it! Her heart
          skipped a beat at the abrupt change, she was keenly observing his
          control, she was lost in memorizing his movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would have made more sense had he tried to balance it and slowly
          lost control, but… it was just too abrupt!
        </p>
        <p>Swish! Crack!</p>
        <p>
          The talisman again started to show cracks similar to how it happened
          in her case.Tiny fissures snaked across the surface, the glow dimming
          n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this time, Oliver stopped applying any more espera before it
          burst like before and put them in danger of injury like before.
        </p>
        <p>
          He released a breath he didn't realize he was holding, his hands
          steady as he withdrew his energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, the control is really complex. I felt it was going quite well,
          but then all of a sudden, I felt a strong turbulence and was caught
          off guard, hahaha," he laughed as he narrated his experience. He
          rubbed his head as if wiping non-existent sweat.
        </p>
        <p>
          His laugh was forced, the tension in his shoulders betraying his
          casual demeanor, at least to her.
        </p>
        <p>In reality, this was not at all true, but a complete facade.</p>
        <p>
          He was already able to grasp the correct way to control the espera
          flow the moment he first started to apply espera in the circuits
          present in the talisman. . The patterns and pathways of the espera
          were clear in his mind, each line a map he could follow with ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          He even had a way prepared to maintain and coordinate the balance
          between the two elements on his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          With [Cosmic Void Gaze], he was directly able to observe in which line
          his espera was going and how the other espera was reacting towards
          it—the places where it would react more, the places where it would
          react less.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes glowed faintly, the world around him shifting into sharp
          focus as the cosmic energy revealed the hidden flows of nature.
        </p>
        <p>He was able to notice everything with ease.</p>
        <p>
          Had he tried a little more, he would have definitely succeeded in
          balancing it out.
        </p>
        <p>It would have been completed on his first try alone.</p>

        <p>
          'Well, the tenfold espera talent from Nadia is not for nothing, I
          guess,' he inwardly thought to himself as he felt the wonders of the
          high espera talent. A sense of pride welled up inside him, the potent
          energy humming beneath his skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that he experienced it in person practically, he could clearly say
          that this talent was not just for show; it was too easy for him!
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the girl staring at him with a complex gaze. He still had
          to increase his relativeness with her, so if he had already completed
          it on his first try, the distance between them might grow further.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he wanted to bond with her, he had to make it as natural as
          possible and achieve it swiftly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could now discuss with her how they should proceed and what tactics
          they should employ to control the elemental espera.
        </p>
        <p>More time gave more opportunities to him.</p>
        <p>
          "Why did you suddenly…? Like… I could sense that you were doing it
          extremely well, so… the sudden imbalance and loss of control… I am a
          bit confused." Evelyn could not help but ask him. Her voice was
          hesitant, a mix of curiosity and concern.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Same. I was totally not expecting that in the end. I could tell that
          I was doing it correctly until it suddenly happened, and for some
          reason, I just could not maintain it. Maybe a few more tries, and I
          might get the hang of the entire process?" he replied, feigning
          disbelief at the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes met hers briefly before looking away, adding to the illusion
          of his confusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at him being appalled at this situation as well, Evelyn
          nodded. She did feel it was odd, but there could be many reasons.
          Maybe it was the circuit that was the problem?
        </p>
        <p>
          She fell into thoughts of her own. What if she supplied espera in an
          instant and controlled it afterward? Her mind raced with
          possibilities, each scenario playing out in her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or if she should gather the espera and isolate it from the other
          elemental espera instead?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then she could slowly try to assimilate the two elements without
          worrying about filling it in the process?
        </p>
        <p>Or…</p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, she was consumed by her own thoughts as she pondered on
          ways to improve the process, finding different ways and experimenting
          in her head. Her fingers traced invisible patterns in the air,
          mimicking the pathways she envisioned.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at her engrossed in her own world of thoughts, Oliver nodded
          to himself. A small, satisfied smile tugged at his lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          The protagonist right now was in the process of decoding the
          situation. Given her intellect, it should not take her long either to
          figure out the entire process and achieve it practically too.
        </p>
        <p>
          He just had to wait now for some time and implement his own plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, they became busy thinking up ways to achieve the result
          they desired.

        <p>
          On the other hand, the others did not sit idly either and were busy
          with their own strategies.
        </p>
        <p>"Come on! This is the fourth time you are messing up!"</p>
        <p>
          A frustrated groan from a girl sounded out as she scrutinized the boy
          in front of her. Her hands were on her hips, her eyes glaring daggers
          at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was none other than Amber, who was currently reprimanding Alphonso
          for not being able to complete the process. Her cheeks flushed with
          irritation, her foot tapping impatiently against the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their approach was different from the others, with them dividing the
          roles between each other. Some portions of the circuit were supposed
          to be filled by Amber, while the rest would be Alphonso's
          responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being proficient with tools and belonging to the lineage of genius
          tool exorcists, she did not hesitate and quickly got the hang of the
          methods and the talisman's overall structural creation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her opinion, they had the best chance of winning this small yet
          meaningful challenge undoubtedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was confident in this because she was able to grasp how to
          coordinate with the talisman and balance the wind element Alphonso
          had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her earth element was robust and easily able to suppress and control
          the wind element—she was able to expertly tune the wind-attributed
          espera as she wanted to and balance it out. The earthy brown energy
          swirled around her, solid and unwavering, as it intertwined with the
          airy tendrils of Alphonso's wind element.
        </p>
        <p>Then what was the problem if she could already do this?</p>
        <p>
          The main issue was with Alphonso. He was still having difficulty
          grasping the technique and control to balance out her earth-attributed
          espera in the talisman—always messing it up. His brow furrowed in
          concentration, beads of sweat forming on his forehead as he struggled
          to maintain the flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, unlike Oliver and Evelyn, who were causing mini explosions
          again and again, Amber did not let such a situation happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever she sensed him losing the grip on the talisman, she would
          directly intervene and control the situation on her own, preventing
          the explosion from taking place. Her quick reflexes and sharp
          intuition kept them safe, her hands steady as she took over the flow
          the moment he even showed the signs of imbalance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come on, Alphonso! What are you even doing!?" An agitated voice
          scolded in a high pitched tone.
        </p>
        <p>_________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 143 &nbsp;Amber's frustration! Nadia's confusion!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 143</p>
        <p>
          "Alphonso, you need to keep your mind focused," Amber advised, her
          tone firm and agitated. She could not help it. Her eyes flashed with
          irritation, her fingers tapping impatiently on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded, trying once more but failing again. "I'm trying, Amber.
          It's just not working," he admitted, frustration seeping into his
          voice as well. He clenched his fists, his knuckles turning white. It
          was not easy for him either.
        </p>
        <p>
          She sighed, "Maybe we should move on to the next step and come back to
          this later?" Her shoulders slumped slightly, a weary look crossing her
          face.
        </p>
        <p>She had said this before too…</p>
        <p>
          "No," he said sharply, shaking his head. "I need to get this right."
          His voice was resolute, his eyes narrowing in determination, he had no
          plans to follow her as is and leave this crucial step behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt frustrated. Because of this, everything was significantly
          slowed down, even though she was able to control and balance the two
          elements and espera. A storm of emotions was churning inside her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Look, if you want to understand the principle and method behind this,
          I can teach you," she offered, trying to keep her cool. Her voice was
          tinged with exasperation, her patience now wearing thin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since she had already managed to understand it herself, she would not
          mind explaining it to her teammate as well, since this would give them
          a huge advantage over the other two teams.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I said no," Alphonso replied, more sharply this time. "I need to
          figure this out on my own." His jaw tightened, a flicker of pride in
          his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why are you so insistent on doing it by yourself!?" she demanded, her
          frustration bubbling over.
        </p>
        <p>She threw her hands up in exasperation, her voice rising.</p>
        <p>
          "It's my noble pride as a gentleman," he replied, his jaw set
          stubbornly, his eyes defiant as he refused her help. "If I can't
          figure out something like this on my own, I'm not worthy to lead my
          clan."
        </p>
        <p>
          But he still had a calm in his tone despite all this, he always used a
          proper tone whenever talking with women. He did not get angry at
          Amber's hastiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          He told her that Sigfor had devised this challenge for them to be able
          to gain a higher degree of control over their espera and get in tune
          with a stranger's espera when necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his opinion, if he did not manage to do that on his own, then he
          would not be worthy enough for his clan and to lead his clan in the
          future. As an heir, it was his responsibility to win fair and square.
        </p>
        <p>
          So despite her constant efforts, he never listened to her and
          continued trying again and again.
        </p>

        <p>
          He wanted to be able to achieve the technique to balance the espera
          himself as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          While she understood where he was coming from and felt that he was
          right to some extent, it could not suppress her annoyance at him
          either. Her fists clenched at her sides, a vein throbbing on her
          temple.
        </p>
        <p>She was pissed.</p>
        <p>
          "You're slowing us down, Alphonso!" Amber snapped, her fists clenched
          at her sides, her teeth grinding in frustration. Her voice echoed in
          the room, drawing the attention of others.
        </p>
        <p>
          The attention was short-lived as they resumed what they were doing.
        </p>
        <p>"I know," he said quietly, "but this is something I have to do."</p>
        <p>His eyes softened momentarily, a hint of apology in his tone.</p>
        <p>
          Although it was not his fault, he still felt a that due to his lack of
          ability, he was slowing her down. Had elder Sigfor permitted them to
          work individually, he would have gladly let Amber move forward without
          dragging her down.
        </p>
        <p>Amber pinched her forehead.</p>
        <p>She really wanted to win this challenge.</p>
        <p>
          She wanted to show everyone her ability, especially to a certain
          someone who never seemed to acknowledge her. Her eyes glanced briefly
          toward the figure in the shadows, her expression hardening.
        </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Daniel and Nadia were busy with their own tasks.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia barely spoke to him and just focused on controlling the elements
          and espera within the talisman. Her eyes were cold and calculating,
          her movements precise and controlled.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel, however, tried several times to initiate a conversation with
          her, but she ignored him like an insect.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but feel a weird sense of discomfort at being
          ignored constantly. However, since she was a girl, he did not say
          anything to her and kept trying to talk to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          His attempts at small talk were met with icy silence, his words
          hanging awkwardly in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was Oliver's older sister and on par with him and Bella. She was
          also an obstacle that he had to surpass one day in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, she belonged to the infamous Mystic Purge Clan. He
          somewhat admired the clan, to be honest, despite all the bad rumors
          associated with their name and standings.
        </p>

        <p>The reason was simple.</p>
        <p>
          He admired the clan's freedom and spirit; they did not care about
          anyone's opinion and did whatever they wanted without fearing anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were powerful, killed their enemies without showing a shred of
          mercy, and were ruthless even to their own kin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their ruthless efficiency and unyielding resolve struck a chord with
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          A clan based on merit, if you turned out to be strong and talented,
          you would be valued the most by the clan no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>Potential was never wasted in the clan.</p>
        <p>
          As a hot-blooded male himself, he felt a strong sense of resemblance
          with such a clan. He often resonated with their means and tactics.
        </p>
        <p>
          He aspired to become an exorcist one day that could slice apart
          anything with a swing of his sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was also why he did not feel offended by Nadia's cold shoulder
          and indifferent behavior toward him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could understand her upbringing; in a situation where siblings
          target each other's throats to stand at the top, it was natural that
          she was this cold and indifferent to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps only Oliver and she had some level of intimacy as twin
          siblings related by the same blood, but he rarely saw them talk with
          each other, much less interact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he kept filling the talismans with thunder-attributed
          espera and gave them to her so that she could balance them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The talismans crackled with energy, the thunder espera coursing
          through them like a live wire.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he had to admit that her control was flawless; she was already
          grasping the theory behind it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had earlier noticed how Oliver and Evelyn had been causing
          continuous explosions, unable to balance out.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Nadia was different; she directly froze the entire talisman
          with her ice element before it could even have a single chance of
          releasing the excessive amount of energy and exploding in their faces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The talisman glowed with a frosty sheen, the ice element locking the
          energy in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          While she would not reply to his questions or talks, whenever he asked
          her for a talisman half-filled with her ice-attributed espera, she
          would throw a bunch towards him occasionally.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her throws were precise, the talismans landing neatly in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>This was more than enough for him to practice on his own as well.</p>
        <p>
          "So? I can see why you are so strong, but do you happen to know how
          Oliver became so strong?" Daniel asked another question to the
          emotionless doll sitting next to him.
        </p>
        <p>He watched her carefully, hoping for a flicker of response.</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          She once again did not reply to his bothersome questions and ignored
          him.
        </p>
        <p>Her silence was deafening, a wall between them.</p>
        <p>But in fact, in her mind, she was also pondering this question.</p>
        <p>
          How exactly did Oliver become so strong in such a short span of time?
        </p>
        <p>
          She remembered how brutally he was beaten by the third pair of
          siblings that day, and unless she had protected him, he would have
          died right there alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But in just a few months, his strength rose so much that he was able
          to handle and kill minor-level demons alone on his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was something that had been bugging her for some time. She could
          not deduce a reasonable explanation for this exponential growth in
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>It just did not make any sense.</p>
        <p>
          She had thought before that he might have signed a contract with a
          demonic entity for temporary strength in exchange for his soul, but
          that was highly unlikely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finding a demon inside a clan was next to impossible—especially where
          he lived. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          And secondly, if he had signed a contract with a demon and turned into
          a heretic, their mother would have surely and instantly noticed that.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since she did not say anything of it, then surely that was not the
          case either.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then what was that dark malevolent energy radiating from inside
          him when she used her special eyes to see through him in the car that
          day?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was so ominous that her heart almost burst out right there, and she
          accidentally launched an attack to kill him, which was unexpectedly
          stopped by his bare hands as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The memory sent a shiver down her spine, her fingers twitching
          involuntarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          All of this situation was quite complex in her opinion, but she was
          too cold to ask him about it directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why does he not tell me about it directly on his own without asking?'
        </p>
        <p>
          She wondered a ridiculous thought, not even knowing what that meant.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 144 &nbsp;Ready to bind? Second Target?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 144</p>
        <p>
          All of this situation was quite complex in her opinion, but she was
          too cold to ask him about it directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why does he not tell me about it directly?' she thought as a flicker
          of confusion passed through her indifferent eyes. Her expression
          softened momentarily, the mask slipping just a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone listened to her right now, they would definitely feel
          speechless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Girl, why would he tell you about his guarded secrets for no reason?
          Talk with some sense?
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, Nadia's mentality worked differently compared to normal
          people, so she was not at fault either.
        </p>
        <p>"Damn, ignored again!"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel said to himself as he filled up another talisman and passed it
          to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Another word, and I will cut off your tongue," Nadia threatened in a
          chilling cold voice, as her hand turned straight. Her eyes were icy,
          her tone leaving no room for doubt.
        </p>
        <p>Gulp.</p>
        <p>
          Daniel felt the raw killing intent and shut his mouth immediately. He
          did not dare to bother her and provoke her anymore after this.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced around nervously, the cold sweat on his brow glistening
          under the light.
        </p>
        <p>She might really cut off his tongue!</p>
        <p>
          Although he could heal it afterward using an elixir, that would be
          very painful, and he was not loaded with elixirs either. He only had
          one elixir for emergencies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he remembered how she tortured Alphonso during the
          duel.
        </p>
        <p>'Poor guy, he still might have a fear of women.'</p>
        <p>
          He glanced in his direction, and indeed his thoughts were confirmed
          when he saw him sitting two desks away from Amber, quietly filling up
          talismans.
        </p>
        <p>A hint of pity flashed in his eyes towards Alphonso.</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso, who was busy coordinating elements, sensed a gaze on him and
          looked up to see Daniel looking at him with a sympathetic gaze.
        </p>

        <p>"???"</p>
        <p>
          He confusedly looked at the guy, not knowing what the latter wanted
          from him. His brow furrowed, and he tilted his head slightly,
          questioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon seeing no change, he too ignored Daniel and went back to work on
          the talisman. He was close to finding out the principles to balance
          out the espera of two different elements.

        </p>
        <p>It was unknown what was in his mind, after all.</p>

        <p>
          'Hmm, they are not doing bad, instead, quite decent. Especially the
          level and progress they are making while training and coordination.
          Impressive. As expected from geniuses of the five major clans.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor quietly observed everything from the sidelines; he was
          especially impressed by their ability to grow during training. His
          eyes scanned the room, taking in each student's progress with a keen
          interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quite clear to him that all of them were properly trying to
          learn and understand the concept and theory behind this rather than
          forcing it or not bothering with the methods.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he had to say, it was probably one of the few things that separated
          a genius from a common person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso had also made him quite satisfied with his determination when
          he straight up refused to learn the technique and method from Amber,
          who had already grasped it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber's talent in tools was probably the highest among the bunch of
          kids in the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there was that dumb-looking brat with a foul mouth and the girl
          from Mystic Purge Clan; they seemed to be doing well too.
        </p>
        <p>
          While they did not coordinate much together, they both were on a
          decent pace and would probably grasp the concept of balance soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there was Evelyn, the golden-haired girl with the legendary light
          element. She was a genius; each try she took, she would improve
          significantly and was very close to doing it perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but notice another anomaly in the group, which was
          again that white-haired kid called Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would control his espera like an expert and easily balance out the
          espera too, but just in the end when it was extremely close to
          completion, he would decimate everything and lose balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time, his movements were graceful and precise until the very last
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>'He is doing this purposefully…'</p>

        <p>
          Sigfor was no fool. He could tell that Oliver was kidding around and
          had already grasped the concept well enough to balance it.
        </p>
        <p>It was no coincidence either that he was doing this.</p>
        <p>Had it happened once, he would have believed it.</p>
        <p>Had it happened twice, he would have believed it.</p>
        <p>Had it happened thrice, he would have still believed it.</p>
        <p>
          But upon seeing the same thing happen over and over for the nth number
          of times by now, Sigfor was a hundred percent sure that this
          white-haired kid was most probably fooling around.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fooling around either with that golden-haired girl or just passing
          time with no care.
        </p>
        <p>Whatever it was, one thing was clear, n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om</p>
        <p>Oliver had also managed to grasp the true concept behind this.</p>
        <p>"Hey, look, Oliver! I managed to complete it!"</p>
        <p>Evelyn called out to the guy snoozing next to her.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver woke up due to the sudden noise. Just now, he was quite bored,
          so he fell asleep after giving her a heads-up and filling multiple
          talismans with his water-attributed espera.
        </p>
        <p>His eyes fluttered open, a slight smile playing on his lips.</p>
        <p>As for his own training?</p>
        <p>
          He already managed to find the solution to it and showed it to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dropping a few hints, he went to sleep only to be woken up by her
          excited shout as she managed to achieve a balance too.
        </p>
        <p>"Great," he clapped lightly, "You finally did it too."</p>
        <p>
          "Well then, would you like to rest for some time before we decide on
          what to make of the combination of our elements?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Actually," she said as a tired look appeared in her eyes, "I think I
          will just rest for a while." Her shoulders sagged, and she rubbed her
          eyes, dark circles visible underneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had evident dark circles under her eyes and her hair was not in
          the best state either. She looked disheveled and untidy now that she
          was finally done.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quite clear that she did not stop once and kept forcing herself
          to achieve the desired result.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver nodded and leaned against the desk, staring at the ceiling. The
          cool surface of the desk pressed against his back, offering a
          momentary relief.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had been at it for more than 30 hours by now without any breaks
          or pauses whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn was extremely hard-working; she did not deter from doing the
          task until it was completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not the main protagonist for nothing. Her concentration was
          amazing.
        </p>
        <p>He glanced around to see the others but found none.</p>
        <p>
          They were probably sleeping by now in rooms arranged by the elder
          called Sigfor.
        </p>
        <p>They would rest and come and then go back and rest.</p>
        <p>
          Occasionally, Daniel or Alphonso would take him out to get some air,
          but he still stayed with Evelyn.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt a hint of pity at the thought of her working alone without
          anyone by her side.
        </p>
        <p>The image of her solitary struggle tugged at his heartstrings.</p>
        <p>
          Whether she appreciated his effort or not, it was his choice to stay
          by her side and give her support.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well then, it's about time to implement the final step,' he thought
          to himself as he looked at the tired girl who was now slumped onto the
          desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          After an hour or two, she woke up on her own and looked around with
          momentary confusion before realization dawned on her mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          She quickly remembered where she was and what they had been doing. Her
          eyes widened briefly before settling back into focus.
        </p>
        <p>She turned around and saw Oliver also looking at her.</p>
        <p>He smiled slightly and raised his hand holding a talisman.</p>
        <p>"Ready now?" he asked with a hint of amusement.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm. I am. Now we need to think of a combination to impress Elder
          Sigfor," she nodded and said.
        </p>
        <p>"But before that…" he started.</p>
        <p>"Yes?"</p>
        <p>
          "Can you give me your hand for a moment?" he said while looking at her
          in a serious manner.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My hand?" She looked confused upon such an unexpected request. Her
          brows furrowed, her gaze questioning.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, your hand. I was thinking that since we are going to coordinate
          anyways, how about we do it after getting a better feel of each
          other's espera? Doing this would definitely benefit us in the future."
          He paused before adding, "How about it? I will let you inject your
          espera into me, and so will I too."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course, if you are uncomfortable about it then you do not need to
          do it. It's just a suggestion on my end. But I feel it would be better
          if we do that."
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn opened her mouth but could not say anything. This was indeed
          logical. She too felt if they wanted a better grasp over each other's
          espera and form a synergy between themselves, it was necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          She stretched forward her hand towards him and smiled, "Sure! Let's
          try it. I am also curious."
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 145 &nbsp;Second Target! Two Paths!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 145</p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded and placed her hand between his palms as he started to
          channel his espera into her. A faint glow surrounded their hands, the
          energy flowing smoothly between them. The warmth of his espera pulsed
          gently, intertwining with hers. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          This was all, of course, for the sake of binding with her. It was not
          that he wanted to do this for synergy between them or anything like
          that, but since he had said so, he had to at least channel his espera
          into her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thing he was doing right now was considered quite bold and frowned
          upon in the exorcist world because it was akin to prying into the
          secrets of the other party using their espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could feel the weight of the taboo action, a slight thrill
          accompanying the risk.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, since Evelyn had also agreed to this idea, it was not an
          issue, and she too was going to pry into him, so this was all a fair
          deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once inside, he could instantly kill her or cripple her if he intends
          to, that was how vulnerable this act was. Of course, he had no such
          intentions. He merely wanted to have some form of physical contact
          with her to fill in the system's condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling the dense and potent espera invading her nerves, she could not
          help but feel surprised. His espera was so powerful and pure. She
          could feel the sheer difference in quality.
        </p>
        <p>
          It surged through her veins like liquid fire, making her heart race.
        </p>
        <p>Did he drink an elixir to refine his espera?</p>
        <p>
          She could not help but feel a tingling sensation crawling under her
          skin, but she endured and closed her eyes to guide his espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her breath hitched slightly, focusing intently on the task at hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver smiled as he stared in front of him, at the blank air before
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not crazy but instead was looking at a familiar floating black
          screen with golden words.

          'Yes!' Oliver was overjoyed as he finally received the notification.

        <p>[Notice: ERROR]</p>
        <p>________</p>
        <p>
          'This is…?' he stopped midway. Before he could get a chance to
          celebrate binding with the main protagonist, the system suddenly
          showed an unexpected error.
        </p>
        <p>
          'What is this supposed to mean?' he frowned, looking at the system
          screen with a hint of caution and apprehension written all over his
          face.
        </p>
        <p>His fingers tightened around Evelyn's hand reflexively.</p>
        <p>[Ding! Detected the interference of Abyss…]</p>
        <p>
          'Abyss!?' Oliver's eyes suddenly shot wide, disbelief clouding his
          expression. His heart pounded in his chest, a cold sweat breaking out
          on his forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          He never expected that Abyss would be able to intervene and affect
          him.
        </p>
        <p>Was Abyss this omnipotent!?</p>
        <p>
          He had a shuddering feeling inside his chest when he read the screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for some reason, his heart was calm as if it knew what was
          happening.
        </p>
        <p>An eerie sense of acceptance settled over him.</p>
        <p>[Ding! Analyzing the cause…]</p>
        <p>
          [Detected! Evelyn Starborn associated with the Divinity! Incompatible
          target for circuit of Abyss!]
        </p>
        <p>[Ding! Creating Alternatives…]</p>
        <p>[Alternative found!]</p>
        <p>_____________</p>
        <p>Bzzt-!</p>
        <p>
          A buzzing sound resonated in his head as a strange change seemed to
          take place within him. It was an unidentifiable feeling; he could not
          clearly express it, but he was aware that something was happening and
          changing inside his mind.
        </p>
        <p>His vision blurred momentarily, the world spinning around him.</p>
        <p>[Host must select a path:</p>
        <p>[Path of Divinity]</p>

        <p>[Path of Abyss]</p>
        <p>
          [Note: An affiliation is mandatory; Abyss and Heavens cannot coexist.
          A choice must be made.]
        </p>
        <p>
          A flood of knowledge poured into his brain directly as he took a deep
          breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was information about what was going to happen in case he chose a
          specific path.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he decided to choose the Path of Heavens and Divinity, his body
          would undergo another transformation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The circuit of Abyss would be forcefully removed from inside his body
          by the divinity. His soul itself, which had been filled with Abyss
          energy and become one with Abyss, would be reshaped.
        </p>
        <p>
          His soul harboring the corrupt energy inside would be baptized by the
          divine energy from Heavens, cleansing it of anything related to Abyss
          in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but this whole process had very low chances of even
          succeeding, as per the information he received.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abyss was not something that could be understood; the divine energy
          could only try to remove the influence. It was all too dangerous a
          process that he would have to undergo if he decided to become one with
          Heavens.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, on the other hand, if he decided to choose the Path of Abyss,
          nothing would happen, and he would continue progressing as he had
          been.
        </p>
        <p>But then what about binding with Evelyn, the main protagonist?</p>
        <p>
          Oliver could never let go of the fruitful golden opportunities she
          would stumble upon in the future. He was a hundred percent sure that
          many of them were significant milestones, and if he received tenfold
          of such power, it was just unimaginable.
        </p>
        <p>So the system derived another alternative for this situation.</p>
        <p>
          If he binds with Evelyn right now and still chooses the Path of Abyss
          to continue, then anything Evelyn achieves to further her progress
          related to anything divine would be converted and transformed in a way
          suitable for him, who was on the Path of Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time when he became a circuit of Abyss, he received some
          incomprehensible knowledge, most of which was still not deciphered by
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he selected the Path of Abyss, the unknown knowledge in his mind
          imparted by Abyss would start becoming available to be comprehended by
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time Evelyn achieved a significant milestone, as per the
          system's standards, a portion of the unknown knowledge would be
          revealed to him or entirely new knowledge would be given depending on
          the situation.
        </p>
        <p>All to make him progress on the Path of Abyss!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was now calmer than before as he took a deep breath and
          exhaled. The decision weighed heavily on him, but his resolve was
          firm.
        </p>
        <p>He was still holding Evelyn's wrist in his hand.</p>
        <p>He smiled as he let go of her hand finally.</p>
        <p>
          He had made his choice already; it was not something he needed to
          think about.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment he became a circuit of Abyss, a conduit of Abyss, he knew
          the path he was going to walk on.
        </p>

        <p>
          He had already started to progress on that path; his Abyss energy was
          ever-growing.
        </p>
        <p>Corrupt? Well, that was a term used to describe that energy.</p>
        <p>
          But to him, it did not feel that way. He felt a familiar and
          comfortable feeling with Abyss energy, nothing corrupt.
        </p>
        <p>He smiled as he declared his choice.</p>
        <p>'[Path of Abyss]'</p>
        <p>
          He was not going to switch to Heavens now that he has already become
          one with Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>
          He doubted if divine energy could provide him the same power he
          desired in the future. Would divine energy allow him to kill without
          remorse?
        </p>
        <p>
          Would divine energy help him devour his enemies without restraint?
        </p>
        <p>
          Were Heavens just and fair to all? No, or else everyone would have
          been born equal.
        </p>
        <p>
          But everyone die in the end. Does that make Abyss fair to all? He did
          not know, it was a mystery of its own. He might find an answer to it
          in the future perhaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heavens were just one side of a coin; there was nothing good or evil.
          It was all a sense of perception established in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          What humans considered good might not always be good for other races,
          and such was the case for others too. This was also the root cause of
          any conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he had made his choice; there was no stopping it anymore.
        </p>
        <p>[Ding! Path of Abyss! Heavens discarded!]</p>
        <p>[Binding… 1%… 69%… 100%… Successful!]</p>
        <p>[Evelyn Starborn is now the target.]</p>
        <p>
          He had successfully shifted the target from Nadia to Evelyn now
          without any issues.
        </p>
        <p>"So, how was it?" Evelyn's voice brought him out of his thoughts.</p>
        <p>
          He looked at her with calm eyes, "It was eye-opening. I feel that we
          can coordinate better now," he said. His smile was genuine, hiding the
          turmoil within.
        </p>
        <p>"Is that so?" She raised a brow at that.</p>
        <p>
          "That's right, your espera was blindingly radiant and pure. It had a
          sense of warmth to it. The light-attributed espera is amazing," he
          praised her.
        </p>
        <p>"T-Thanks!"</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn smiled awkwardly at that. She did not know how to reply to
          that. A faint blush colored her cheeks, and she tucked a loose strand
          of hair behind her ear.
        </p>
        <p>
          "W-Well, should I try it too…? Of course, if you are fine with it…"
          She fidgeted a little when she said this in a low tone.
        </p>
        <p>It was evident that she was weak to flattery.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was amused. In the future, she was going to be immune to any
          level of flattery. She would have gotten so used to the tons of
          flattering words she would hear from the mouths of the people she was
          going to save.
        </p>
        <p>But right now, she was still inexperienced and shy when praised.</p>
        <p>
          "Sure, why not?" he said as he extended his right hand to her, and she
          placed his hand between her palms as he did.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 146 &nbsp;Light was devoured!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 146</p>
        <p>
          "Sure, why not?" he said as he extended his right hand to her. His
          eyes met hers, a reassuring smile on his face.
        </p>
        <p>She placed his hand between her palms as he did.</p>
        <p>
          She focused and started to channel her espera into him. The energy was
          cool and soothing, like a gentle breeze on a summer day. n/ô/vel/b//jn
          dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          A soft glow enveloped their joined hands, pulsing with a rhythmic
          flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver experienced the sensation of ants crawling under his skin. His
          nerves were tense too.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took a deep breath, steadying himself against the unfamiliar
          intrusion.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Evelyn messed up here, he would undoubtedly suffer a serious
          injury. He immediately supplied his own espera to guide her inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mingling energies created a delicate balance, a dance of light and
          shadow within him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not back out either, as it would be unfair to her since she
          allowed him to pry into her and have a deeper view of her espera, so
          it was natural that he would let her do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Evelyn was not the protagonist of the world, he would never have
          let someone her age let their espera flow into his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The risk was too great, but the potential reward was worth it. If they
          could be in more synergy in the future, it would benefit them both
          equally.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was simply too risky. Evelyn was a genius among geniuses, so he was
          able to guide her into it.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, while Oliver was thinking about all this, Evelyn
          was in a world of her own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through her senses, she could see what she was feeling to some extent.
          Right now, while she was inside Oliver getting familiar with his
          espera, she felt like she was standing in the middle of an ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The vast expanse of energy around her was both overwhelming and
          awe-inspiring.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ocean was endlessly vast, with no visible end. Its depth was
          unknown and invisible, going as deep as the eye could see.
        </p>
        <p>
          The espera she was experiencing was countless times more potent than
          any espera she had experienced this closely.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least in terms of purity, she was sure that even her sister was not
          his match. He was simply leagues ahead. Her respect for Oliver's power
          grew, mingling with a sense of curiosity and admiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The surface of the ocean seemed calm, as if the ocean was dead, with
          minimal to no waves or tides. This showcased how terrifying his
          control over his element and espera was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every ripple in the water seemed deliberate, showing his mastery over
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everywhere she looked was the brightest of colors; it was truly a
          mystical sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          She got so lost in him and feeling his espera that she lost track of
          time, wandering her senses inside him. She experienced a newfound
          sense of freedom in that enclosed yet vast world of its own.
        </p>
        <p>"Umm… Evelyn, I think it's been a long time already."</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly a magnetic voice drew her attention. She was still unfocused
          and dazed; the magnetic voice seemed like a tune to her ears.
        </p>
        <p>But suddenly, she felt a strong pull on her body.</p>
        <p>
          'What's happening?' she wondered, her eyes feeling sluggish. She
          seemed to want to stay in this place more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The enchanting tranquility of the ocean called to her, urging her to
          remain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Subconsciously, she started to resist the pull outwards and stubbornly
          maintained herself in that place, clearly unwilling to leave this
          beautiful and magical place so quickly and suddenly.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this was happening inside, the situation outside was much
          different.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had a dark expression on his face as he tried to take his hand
          back, but Evelyn was tightly clutching his hand between her palms, not
          letting go even for an instant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her strength was terribly strong for a frail girl. If Oliver was not
          mistaken, in his terms, she might be close to Level 4 in strength
          alone.
        </p>
        <p>Her raw power was something else entirely.</p>
        <p>
          He marveled at her unexpected physical prowess, this showed her latent
          potential as the protagonist, with such strength for her age was
          nothing but impressive.
        </p>

        <p>
          He could easily overpower her with his raw strength alone but
          hesitated.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not dare to be too rough or he might injure himself. An
          internal injury was way worse than an external wound and took much
          longer to recover.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even with the help of potions, internal injuries required a lot of
          care in comparison to external ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not want to waste his potions on such a silly thing, and he did
          not have any elixirs on him either at the moment. Well, he doubted any
          of them did either.
        </p>
        <p>He tried to pull his hand slowly, but it was of no use.</p>
        <p>
          He called out to her multiple times, but she did not even respond.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was getting impatient and curious. What was it that she was seeing
          inside that she was not waking up or answering his calls? Was she fine
          inside or not?
        </p>
        <p>
          He worried both for himself and her. He had to shake off his hand
          somehow from her firm grasp without messing up.
        </p>
        <p>"EVELYN! WAKE UP!" he yelled near her ear.</p>
        <p>
          She frowned but still did not respond. He yelled a few more times
          while also trying to pull his hand back, but the most she would do was
          frown and then go back to how she was.
        </p>
        <p>She was crazy!</p>
        <p>Frustrated, he had no choice but to resort to something else.</p>
        <p>
          Since he couldn't wake her up externally, the only way left was to do
          something internally.
        </p>
        <p>And he had a great idea of what to do.</p>
        <p>Join for FREE at : /WinterDragon573</p>
        <p>He was going to use Abyss energy to push her out.</p>
        <p>
          He closed his eyes for a moment before opening them again. The abyss
          energy inside his body moved, creeping its way towards where Evelyn's
          espera was concentrated the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dark tendrils of energy slithered with purpose, their destination
          clear.
        </p>

        <p>
          It soon reached that point. The corrupted energy extended tendrils
          toward the concentration of espera, slowly breaking it down and
          assimilating it into itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The Abyss energy really is breaking it down so easily…' he had a
          surprised expression. The Abyss energy had devouring properties; he
          was aware of it after his fight with the old ghost. However, he was
          still surprised when he saw the espera breaking down instantly under
          the influence of the corrupted Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It did not even put up a fight, which showed just how potent the abyss
          energy was.
        </p>
        <p>
          He carefully channeled the Abyss energy, extending tendrils of
          corruption towards the pure light-attributed espera—instantly tainting
          it pitch black and absorbing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The merging energies created a stark contrast, darkness enveloping
          light slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to be extremely careful doing this. He did not want to harm
          Evelyn unintentionally while doing this either. She was the main
          protagonist; if he somehow injured her, it might even affect her
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was quite sure that Evelyn was not doing this all on her own.
          Either she was affected by his espera or something else, she was not
          the type to act like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had it been Bella instead of her, Oliver might have considered that
          she was doing it intentionally out of her own curiosity. But Evelyn
          was more mannered and humble than her crazy older sister.
        </p>
        <p>He believed that even she was unaware of what was happening.</p>
        <p>
          If he let the Abyss energy roam free and drown the concentrated
          light-attributed espera inside, Evelyn might even lose her life.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, while he was vulnerable with her espera inside him, she
          too was very vulnerable. Her entire focus and concentration were in
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Abyss energy acted, it might just destroy her will and mind
          instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He slowly surrounded the concentrated espera from all sides and
          started to apply pressure on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The darkness pressed in, constricting the light with an almost
          unshakable force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn, who was fully immersed in the ocean world, was suddenly
          jerked.
        </p>
        <p>She looked around and noticed the sky was getting pitch black.</p>
        <p>
          A creepy sense of discomfort enveloped her chest as she gazed at that
          blackness. It was oddly disgusting to her; a feeling of hatred arose
          in her heart when she looked at it. It was utterly ominous and
          dreadful.
        </p>
        <p>The serene ocean began to churn, reacting to her turmoil.</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn could not help but start to feel suffocated as the foul energy
          covered the sky. It was as if she was getting trapped in a bubble that
          was shrinking slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A golden aura burst forth from her body instinctively. She used her
          light-attributed espera towards the extending dark sky, intending to
          erase it, cleanse it, remove it from existence itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The golden light clashed with the darkness, illuminating the sky with
          a fierce brilliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a cold bucket of water poured on her when her expectations
          were not met. The light only touched the black sky before getting
          sucked into it and disappearing completely.
        </p>
        <p>_______________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 147 &nbsp;Evelyn's despair! Reveal it to him?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 147</p>
        <p>
          What she wanted to do with the dark energy happened to her instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pull on her body intensified, as if forcefully trying to drag her
          outward. Meanwhile, the dark, ominous sky began to descend on the
          beautiful and serene ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          The once tranquil waters now churned violently under the oppressive
          darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's heart throbbed when she saw the foul and corrupted power
          tainting the beautiful and calm ocean. The sight filled her with an
          unexpected sense of loss and despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pristine blue waters turned murky, reflecting her growing
          helplessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          An unfamiliar sense of anger rose within her at that moment. Her eyes
          were fierce; she could not bear to see the ocean being covered in
          pitch-black darkness. It hurt her. Her fists clenched, a fiery
          determination igniting within her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as the strong pull on her body reached its limit, she was
          forcefully dragged out of the mystical place that was slowly being
          ruined. Her eyes could not move away from the scene of destruction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tears of frustration welled up in her eyes as she was torn away from
          the dismal sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          The darkness consumed the last vestiges of light, leaving the ocean in
          complete turmoil.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image burned into her mind, a cruel reminder of the overwhelming
          corruption, a horrifying view.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to protect the place, but she was powerless to do so as the
          force finally pulled her outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her spirit felt battered and bruised as a deep sense of failure washed
          over her.
        </p>
        <p>Her heart ached with helplessness.</p>
        <p>"Huff… Huff… Huff…"</p>
        <p>
          She panted heavily as her consciousness was pulled out of Daniel's
          body and returned to her own.
        </p>
        <p>Her breaths came in ragged gasps, her chest heaving.</p>
        <p>Her eyes were wide, and she clutched her chest while she panted.</p>

        <p>The room around her spun, her legs feeling weak and unsteady.</p>
        <p>She looked as if she had just awoken from a nightmare.</p>
        <p>
          She took a minute to calm herself and slowly steadied her breathing.
          Her hands trembled slightly as she wiped the sweat from her forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mind could still recall the ominous waves of corrupt energy that
          feasted on her espera as if chewing candy.
        </p>
        <p>She felt… powerless.</p>
        <p>She felt… powerless.</p>
        <p>Powerless against that ominous black energy.</p>
        <p>She felt a true sense of fear and rage.</p>
        <p>But more importantly, what exactly had happened?</p>
        <p>
          She looked at Oliver, who was sipping water while calmly watching her.
          His demeanor was relaxed, almost as if nothing unusual had occurred.
        </p>
        <p>Then she realized what they had been doing.</p>
        <p>She could not help but ask, "What happened?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver placed the cup down and said, "You were not coming out. I tried
          to shake you out, but you didn't budge an inch."
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice was calm, but there was a hint of concern in his eyes. He
          wondered if she had sustained any serious mental wounds or not.
        </p>
        <p>"So I had to force you out."</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's face instantly shifted from confusion to embarrassment. Her
          cheeks flushed a deep red as she looked down, avoiding his gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had completely forgotten when she was inside the calm ocean of
          espera. She had become too engrossed in that view, and her mind
          blanked out.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could only imagine how much Oliver must have tried to wake her up
          or shake her off, but she resisted and did not leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was so impolite. The situation could easily be misunderstood as
          her trying to pry deep into his secrets and body now that she had
          unrestricted access to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Oliver could do nothing about it. He had voluntarily allowed her
          will inside, but forcing her out carelessly might have caused him to
          suffer greatly and affect his espera. In the worst case, he might even
          have been crippled if she had tried to make things difficult for him.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, she really did not have such intentions. She herself did not
          know how she lost control, but something about that calm ocean and
          bountiful espera made her get lost in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am sorry! Please forgive me for my actions. I-I can assure you that
          I really did not have any ill intentions at that time. All of it
          happened without me realizing," she stood up and bowed to Oliver while
          apologizing profusely. She looked back at him with guilty eyes.
          "Please trust me, I did not have any bad intentions."
        </p>
        <p>Her voice wavered, and her eyes glistened with unshed tears.</p>
        <p>
          She felt really guilty. Due to her carelessness and lack of
          discipline, this happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had her mind been stronger enough than it was now, she would have been
          able to resist the temptation and could have even resisted that black
          energy from before.
        </p>
        <p>
          To her, Oliver had no reason to trust her either. For all he knew, she
          might have already seen more than she should have been allowed to.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was impossible to tell. Of course, she had not done anything of
          that sort, but convincing him with her words alone was the best she
          could do since she had no concrete proof that she did not pry deep
          into him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, she felt really anxious. If Oliver did not trust her, things
          might escalate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was his idea to try this whole thing, it did not lessen
          her responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not know what to do. If things turned messy, their clan's
          relations might also be affected because of her mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the guilt-ridden girl, Oliver sighed. He was aware that she
          was clueless about what happened inside and did not do it
          intentionally. He rubbed the back of his neck, contemplating his next
          words.
        </p>
        <p>"It's fine. I trust you," he said.</p>
        <p>
          "Really?" she looked back at him in surprise. Oliver was exceptionally
          calm about this.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was natural, after all. He did not worry about her seeing his
          secrets, thanks to Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If even someone like Ophelia was not able to pry through him, Evelyn
          could never do it. He was confident.
        </p>
        <p>The Abyss energy was impossible for them to penetrate.</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn heaved a sigh of relief as she slumped back into the chair. She
          looked at him with a serious face and asked,
        </p>
        <p>
          "How can I make it up to you?" she added. "I know this is not a simple
          matter, and for you to believe my words so easily, I have to show my
          sincerity as well."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her determination shone through her eyes as her earlier fear was
          slowly replaced by resolve.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at her determined face, Oliver pondered. While he knew Evelyn
          did not intend the previous incident, she still wanted to make up for
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that serious face, he knew she would not back down easily, not
          that he intended to waste energy on persuasion.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, I can't think of anything right now. I will let you know in the
          future if I need something from you," he said.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gave her a reassuring smile, trying to ease her anxiety a little.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn thought about it for a moment and nodded. It was not like she
          could ask him to find something right away. She bit her lip, feeling a
          bit more at ease but still wanting to prove her sincerity.
        </p>
        <p>After settling down, she recalled what happened inside his body.</p>
        <p>"What was that foul black energy?"</p>
        <p>
          This time, her tone was deeper and serious. She had a sliver of rage
          when she mentioned that ominous energy. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her. Seeing her frown and hidden anger, he knew she
          was really associated with divinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It did not take a genius to guess that the Abyss and Heavens were
          polar opposites, incompatible existences.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was natural for someone affiliated with divinity to feel loathing
          or negative emotions upon encountering Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn, despite being weak, still had a strong tie to the heavens. The
          Abyss energy was the literal opposite of divinity.
        </p>
        <p>However, he had expected her to ask about it after witnessing it.</p>
        <p>"Black energy? What are you talking about?"</p>
        <p>Oliver looked at her and raised a brow in confusion.</p>
        <p>
          "What!? It's that corrupt thing that was slowly covering the sky! The
          thing that was extending tendrils of darkness all over the space!" she
          slammed the desk as she stood up and looked at him.
        </p>
        <p>Her voice trembled with urgency and frustration.</p>
        <p>
          "Sky? What are you even talking about? I have no idea about any
          tendrils," Oliver had a blank expression on his face. He looked
          innocently clueless.
        </p>
        <p>"Tell me you are joking..." she mumbled.</p>
        <p>
          "What?" Oliver tilted his head at her as if he did not hear what she
          just said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Y-You don't know what that was!? How was it inside you then!? What's
          going on?" Evelyn muttered aloud as she saw his cluelessness. Her mind
          raced, trying to make sense of his ignorance.
        </p>
        <p>Was he really clueless or…?</p>
        <p>"Umm…"</p>
        <p>
          "Seriously…" she had an incredulous look on her face when she realized
          that Oliver did not have a clue about the ominous thing rooted inside
          his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You…" she paused and fell into thought. She contemplated whether to
          tell him about it or not.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 148 &nbsp;Deciding on element combinations!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 148</p>
        <p>
          In the end, after some thinking, she decided not to worry him. She was
          not sure whether that thing was real or just a fragment of her
          imagination experienced while being pulled out of a mystical
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps her mind deluded itself into imagining that thing and relating
          it to the force pulling her will out of Oliver's espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she seriously doubted that. She had experienced that energy so
          closely it could not be fake or imaginary. The memory of its
          malevolent presence lingered, too vivid to dismiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had felt her espera being devoured raw easily. The strong sense of
          corruption and disgust, that primal ominousness, was too horrific to
          be imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had seen demons before when her clan's exorcists would hunt or
          sometimes seal them and bring them back to study.
        </p>
        <p>
          They reeked of dread and danger, but even compared to that, that black
          energy was terribly malevolent and unsettling; it gave off a feeling
          of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a darkness that seemed to swallow light itself, far more
          menacing than any demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wondered what could be darker than a literal demon… and that too
          inside him, a human being.
        </p>
        <p>She thought about what to do. Should she consult her mother?</p>
        <p>
          Her mother had a friend who was a highly skilled exorcist, just like
          her, someone with a light element. She was far more knowledgeable
          about such matters than Evelyn was.
        </p>
        <p>
          She should consult her mother and ask for advice. Perhaps they could
          tell the difference, whether it was her imagination or real.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Oliver was really unaware of such a thing inside his body, this was
          a serious issue. He might be in danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          That energy, no, that thing, could very well be a threat to his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, a sense of urgency gripped
          her heart as she realized the potential danger Oliver was in. Her
          resolve hardened, knowing she had to act quickly and decisively.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had to prevent that scenario from ever arising. Despite being
          friends for only a few months, they had developed a strong bond. Their
          shared experiences had forged a connection she couldn't ignore.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were her very first friends; she could not let such an impending
          danger loom over him and threaten his life in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          She had made up her mind to consult about it later or find a clue
          regarding that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oliver, I know this may sound stupid or even weird… but please
          listen. Right now, I cannot tell you about this; I have to be sure
          about it myself first. But…" she paused before continuing, "…if you
          ever feel something odd happening within you, something dark or
          ominous, I want you to contact me first no matter what."
        </p>
        <p>Her eyes bore into his, filled with earnestness and worry.</p>
        <p>
          She spoke in a deadly serious tone, her voice did not carry even the
          slightest sense of childishness that should have been there.
        </p>
        <p>
          '…Ah, it's the classic protagonist dialogue. Not sure about it but
          still willing to put everything into helping their friends. Cannot
          tell the victim about it, cannot discuss the future, cannot warn the
          victim. Just trust the protagonist.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's lips curled up slightly; he found it amusing and quite
          interesting that Evelyn was willing to help him with a problem that
          did not even exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          He admired her determination, even if it was based on a
          misunderstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet he had no intention of stopping her from doing this. By the time
          she even got a clue about it, he would have already made sufficient
          preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now that it's over, how about we come up with a suitable attack for
          our elements together?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haah… you are right, let's not divert from the main topic of this
          whole thing." She sighed deeply, her shoulders relaxing as she let go
          of the intense emotions from earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn could not help but sigh; the past few moments had been quite
          intense for her, and her mind felt exhausted.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm… I have some ideas about possible combinations. You can listen to
          them and decide if we should go with them or make up something new,"
          he suggested, to which she nodded her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes lit up with excitement as he began to explain his thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, she was too tired to think much; it was better to let him
          decide, and she would see if they could be implemented by her or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had no intention of winning the challenge set by Sigfor; he was
          just going with the flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he and Evelyn happened to win, then it would be unintentional on
          his part.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing to be learned from all this was team coordination and
          synergy improvement, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for him, he had successfully managed to bond with Evelyn as well,
          which had been his main goal since the start.
        </p>
        <p>As for the elemental combinations, it was not too hard.</p>

        <p>
          He, someone with modern knowledge about light and water properties,
          along with the creativity from various fantasy books he used to read,
          could easily come up with a few combinations and techniques of his
          own.
        </p>
        <p>What was light basically?</p>
        <p>
          'Theoretically speaking, light is essentially composed of discrete
          packets of energy called photons,' he pondered.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind raced through various possibilities, each more exciting than
          the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          'And photons have energy, and therefore, light also has energy. Since
          light consists of not one but many photons, light beams could be said
          to be filled with energy.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Water also has a lot of energy in various forms too. Kinetic,
          potential… and so on.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'It's not an imagination to create something destructive if they
          combine their elements together.'
        </p>
        <p>
          People of this world often associated the water element with defense
          and rarely with offense.
        </p>
        <p>So was the case with the light element in the initial stages.</p>
        <p>
          It was just that the element is so rare and important to humanity that
          people revere it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if utilized properly, even the water element could unleash a
          destructive force, in the initial stages at that.
        </p>
        <p>"How about this…"</p>
        <p>
          He looked at her and narrated the idea he had on his mind. Evelyn's
          eyes narrowed the more she heard about the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her expression shifted from curiosity to excitement as she grasped the
          potential of his plan.
        </p>
        <p>____________________</p>
        <p>"Hmm…"</p>
        <p>
          The next day, Sigfor was once again observing the children carefully.
          However, he noticed that the white-haired kid and the golden-haired
          girl were no longer practicing with talismans anymore.
        </p>
        <p>'Have they finally achieved synergy?' he wondered.</p>

        <p>He leaned forward slightly, his interest piqued.</p>
        <p>
          If that was the case, then he had to say that he was quite impressed
          by their talents and coordination skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water and light were two very sensitive elements, not to mention the
          light element was inherently dominant over other elements due to its
          nature as a hybrid element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintaining or forming a balance with two such sensitive elements was
          incomparably hard for someone their age.
        </p>
        <p>He was not expecting them to achieve it so fast and quickly.</p>
        <p>
          They had immense talent. To achieve such a feat at this age was too
          impressive. He had seen countless individuals, and among them, hardly
          a few could have done this at such a young age. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot
          c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked around; they were not the first ones to achieve synergy
          among themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze turned towards another table where Amber and Alphonso were
          engrossed in a sheet of paper, both scribbling down something.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had ultimately forced Alphonso to follow her advice and give him
          hints. Of course, he had tried to stubbornly refuse, but she was so
          frustrated that she directly yelled all the hints and methods out in
          his ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her voice had echoed in the room, leaving Alphonso stunned and
          speechless.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only look at her dumbfounded with disbelief at how crudely
          she had told him about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was so shocked that he was not able to utter a single word at that
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But somehow they had managed to sort it out with each other later and
          had been working on a possible combination since then, planning
          extensively.
        </p>
        <p>"Elder Sigfor…"</p>
        <p>
          A voice called out to him. He looked at the source of the voice, and
          it was the young girl called Evelyn.
        </p>
        <p>Behind her was Oliver, who had a poker face while looking at him.</p>
        <p>
          His expression was unreadable, but his eyes gleamed with anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>"What is it?"</p>
        <p>
          "Well, the thing is… we wanted to practice our element combination and
          if we do that here…" she turned around and looked at others, busy with
          concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her voice trailed off, concern for her fellow mates in case they
          created another massive explosion affecting their concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm? You already thought of something?" he asked in a surprised tone.
          It had not even been a day since she and Oliver managed to achieve
          synergy with their espera.
        </p>
        <p>And they had already managed to think of a possible combination?</p>
        <p>He was quite amused and interested.</p>
        <p>He wondered what he should say.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 148 &nbsp;Deciding on element combinations!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 148</p>
        <p>
          In the end, after some thinking, she decided not to worry him. She was
          not sure whether that thing was real or just a fragment of her
          imagination experienced while being pulled out of a mystical
          environment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps her mind deluded itself into imagining that thing and relating
          it to the force pulling her will out of Oliver's espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she seriously doubted that. She had experienced that energy so
          closely it could not be fake or imaginary. The memory of its
          malevolent presence lingered, too vivid to dismiss.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had felt her espera being devoured raw easily. The strong sense of
          corruption and disgust, that primal ominousness, was too horrific to
          be imagination.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had seen demons before when her clan's exorcists would hunt or
          sometimes seal them and bring them back to study.
        </p>
        <p>
          They reeked of dread and danger, but even compared to that, that black
          energy was terribly malevolent and unsettling; it gave off a feeling
          of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a darkness that seemed to swallow light itself, far more
          menacing than any demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wondered what could be darker than a literal demon… and that too
          inside him, a human being.
        </p>
        <p>She thought about what to do. Should she consult her mother?</p>
        <p>
          Her mother had a friend who was a highly skilled exorcist, just like
          her, someone with a light element. She was far more knowledgeable
          about such matters than Evelyn was.
        </p>
        <p>
          She should consult her mother and ask for advice. Perhaps they could
          tell the difference, whether it was her imagination or real.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Oliver was really unaware of such a thing inside his body, this was
          a serious issue. He might be in danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          That energy, no, that thing, could very well be a threat to his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          She closed her eyes and took a deep breath, a sense of urgency gripped
          her heart as she realized the potential danger Oliver was in. Her
          resolve hardened, knowing she had to act quickly and decisively.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had to prevent that scenario from ever arising. Despite being
          friends for only a few months, they had developed a strong bond. Their
          shared experiences had forged a connection she couldn't ignore.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were her very first friends; she could not let such an impending
          danger loom over him and threaten his life in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          She had made up her mind to consult about it later or find a clue
          regarding that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oliver, I know this may sound stupid or even weird… but please
          listen. Right now, I cannot tell you about this; I have to be sure
          about it myself first. But…" she paused before continuing, "…if you
          ever feel something odd happening within you, something dark or
          ominous, I want you to contact me first no matter what."
        </p>
        <p>Her eyes bore into his, filled with earnestness and worry.</p>
        <p>
          She spoke in a deadly serious tone, her voice did not carry even the
          slightest sense of childishness that should have been there.
        </p>
        <p>
          '…Ah, it's the classic protagonist dialogue. Not sure about it but
          still willing to put everything into helping their friends. Cannot
          tell the victim about it, cannot discuss the future, cannot warn the
          victim. Just trust the protagonist.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's lips curled up slightly; he found it amusing and quite
          interesting that Evelyn was willing to help him with a problem that
          did not even exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          He admired her determination, even if it was based on a
          misunderstanding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet he had no intention of stopping her from doing this. By the time
          she even got a clue about it, he would have already made sufficient
          preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now that it's over, how about we come up with a suitable attack for
          our elements together?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haah… you are right, let's not divert from the main topic of this
          whole thing." She sighed deeply, her shoulders relaxing as she let go
          of the intense emotions from earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn could not help but sigh; the past few moments had been quite
          intense for her, and her mind felt exhausted.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm… I have some ideas about possible combinations. You can listen to
          them and decide if we should go with them or make up something new,"
          he suggested, to which she nodded her head.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes lit up with excitement as he began to explain his thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, she was too tired to think much; it was better to let him
          decide, and she would see if they could be implemented by her or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had no intention of winning the challenge set by Sigfor; he was
          just going with the flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he and Evelyn happened to win, then it would be unintentional on
          his part.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing to be learned from all this was team coordination and
          synergy improvement, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for him, he had successfully managed to bond with Evelyn as well,
          which had been his main goal since the start.
        </p>
        <p>As for the elemental combinations, it was not too hard.</p>

        <p>
          He, someone with modern knowledge about light and water properties,
          along with the creativity from various fantasy books he used to read,
          could easily come up with a few combinations and techniques of his
          own.
        </p>
        <p>What was light basically?</p>
        <p>
          'Theoretically speaking, light is essentially composed of discrete
          packets of energy called photons,' he pondered.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind raced through various possibilities, each more exciting than
          the last.
        </p>
        <p>
          'And photons have energy, and therefore, light also has energy. Since
          light consists of not one but many photons, light beams could be said
          to be filled with energy.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Water also has a lot of energy in various forms too. Kinetic,
          potential… and so on.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'It's not an imagination to create something destructive if they
          combine their elements together.'
        </p>
        <p>
          People of this world often associated the water element with defense
          and rarely with offense.
        </p>
        <p>So was the case with the light element in the initial stages.</p>
        <p>
          It was just that the element is so rare and important to humanity that
          people revere it.
        </p>
        <p>
          But if utilized properly, even the water element could unleash a
          destructive force, in the initial stages at that.
        </p>
        <p>"How about this…"</p>
        <p>
          He looked at her and narrated the idea he had on his mind. Evelyn's
          eyes narrowed the more she heard about the idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her expression shifted from curiosity to excitement as she grasped the
          potential of his plan.
        </p>
        <p>____________________</p>
        <p>"Hmm…"</p>
        <p>
          The next day, Sigfor was once again observing the children carefully.
          However, he noticed that the white-haired kid and the golden-haired
          girl were no longer practicing with talismans anymore.
        </p>
        <p>'Have they finally achieved synergy?' he wondered.</p>

        <p>He leaned forward slightly, his interest piqued.</p>
        <p>
          If that was the case, then he had to say that he was quite impressed
          by their talents and coordination skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water and light were two very sensitive elements, not to mention the
          light element was inherently dominant over other elements due to its
          nature as a hybrid element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maintaining or forming a balance with two such sensitive elements was
          incomparably hard for someone their age.
        </p>
        <p>He was not expecting them to achieve it so fast and quickly.</p>
        <p>
          They had immense talent. To achieve such a feat at this age was too
          impressive. He had seen countless individuals, and among them, hardly
          a few could have done this at such a young age. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot

        </p>
        <p>
          He looked around; they were not the first ones to achieve synergy
          among themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze turned towards another table where Amber and Alphonso were
          engrossed in a sheet of paper, both scribbling down something.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had ultimately forced Alphonso to follow her advice and give him
          hints. Of course, he had tried to stubbornly refuse, but she was so
          frustrated that she directly yelled all the hints and methods out in
          his ears.

          speechless.

        <p>
          He could only look at her dumbfounded with disbelief at how crudely
          she had told him about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was so shocked that he was not able to utter a single word at that
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But somehow they had managed to sort it out with each other later and
          had been working on a possible combination since then, planning
          extensively.
        </p>
        <p>"Elder Sigfor…"</p>
        <p>
          A voice called out to him. He looked at the source of the voice, and
          it was the young girl called Evelyn.

          Her voice trailed off, concern for her fellow mates in case they

        <p>And they had already managed to think of a possible combination?</p>
        <p>He was quite amused and interested.</p>
        <p>He wondered what he should say.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 150 &nbsp;Daniel and Nadia!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 150</p>
        <p>
          She saw him staring at the raging cyclone. She seemed quite proud at
          the moment, but it was not long before she saw his neutral and
          uninterested eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Her excitement waned like a flame doused by water.</p>
        <p>
          She could not help but stare intently at him, wondering what was wrong
          with him and whether he could see the spectacle clearly.
        </p>
        <p>His lack of reaction gnawed at her confidence.</p>
        <p>Her heart sank slightly, a shadow of doubt creeping in.</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso, who was initially listening to Sigfor's praise, turned his
          head in her direction and saw her looking somewhere else.
        </p>
        <p>His brows furrowed as he followed her gaze.</p>
        <p>
          Following her gaze, he looked up to see her staring at Oliver and
          Evelyn, who were standing side by side.
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned for a moment, observing her closely. He could tell she was
          more focused on Oliver for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          His body turned stiff for a moment as he harbored a thought. A flicker
          of understanding crossed his mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Could it be that she is…?' he thought with a stoic face, not knowing
          what to make of the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here was Sigfor showering them with praise and tips, but she was not
          even listening; her attention was diverted to the guy behind.
        </p>
        <p>His frustration mounted, feeling the sting of her disregard.</p>
        <p>
          Should this be the behavior of a proper heiress, a lady? To ignore an
          elder's words and fool around?
        </p>
        <p>
          Was she not realizing the importance of proper manners? He felt a
          little uncomfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as he was looking at Amber with a hardened gaze, she turned back
          to him.
        </p>
        <p>"What?" she frowned and questioned.</p>
        <p>
          "You…" he started before pausing for a moment. He thought about it and
          then continued, "It's nothing."
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned back towards Sigfor and continued listening to his words.
          Amber glanced at him weirdly before shrugging her shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>____________</p>

        <p>"Next, who will come?"</p>
        <p>"ME! ME! ME! ELDER SIGFOR!"</p>
        <p>
          A loud voice exclaimed, disturbing the calm and peaceful surroundings
          instantly.
        </p>
        <p>"ELDER! ELDER! WE WANT TO GO NEXT!! ELDER!"</p>
        <p>"Shut up!"</p>
        <p>Sigfor roared, stunning the person behind the loud voice.</p>
        <p>
          "You stupid brat! I can hear you once, why are you shouting here? I
          have not gone senile yet!"
        </p>
        <p>The elder yelled at the boy who instantly shut up.</p>
        <p>
          "Noisy brat…" Sigfor sneered, his eyes holding a hint of anger and
          irritation. He rubbed his temples, trying to keep his composure.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, this was the stupidest kid he had ever taught or mentored
          in his life.
        </p>
        <p>His patience could not keep up with that loud kid.</p>
        <p>Of course, the kid in question was none other than Daniel.</p>
        <p>His boisterous nature was a constant test of Sigfor's patience.</p>
        <p>
          He was so excited by the previous display of elements by Alphonso and
          Amber that he could no longer control himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to show his elemental combination; he could not wait anymore.
        </p>
        <p>His body practically vibrated with eagerness.</p>
        <p>
          He was bubbling with energy and adrenaline after witnessing such a
          display.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor frowned; Daniel was too ill-mannered. It was quite clear they
          were opposites in personality. Yet, there was a raw potential in the
          boy that Sigfor couldn't ignore.
        </p>
        <p>He had to teach Daniel to be more patient and calm.</p>
        <p>"Come forward."</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor snapped his fingers, and the still raging tornado instantly
          dispersed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing him disperse their combination attack so easily, both Amber and
          Alphonso felt a little dull.
        </p>

        <p>
          They exchanged a glance, both humbled by his effortless display of
          power.
        </p>
        <p>Sigfor was indeed unfathomable.</p>
        <p>"Alright! Come on, Nadia!"</p>
        <p>
          He urged as he excitedly got up and went to the space where they were
          supposed to demonstrate.
        </p>
        <p>He almost jumped over when he was finally called.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia was still expressionless; she did not care about such things.
          She would go when she was called.
        </p>
        <p>It did not matter to her whether it was first or last.</p>
        <p>Her calm demeanor was a complete contrast to Daniel's enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>"Show me."</p>
        <p>
          Moving forward, they performed just as spectacularly as the previous
          duo had done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia stepped forward, her face calm, but her eyes held no expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          She extended her hand, and the air around her seemed to shiver. A
          sharp, glistening icicle began to form, growing longer and thicker,
          its surface covered in frosty patterns. It floated menacingly in
          mid-air, the tip pointed outward, ready to strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia had created a sharp and long icicle. It was thick and frosty,
          looking deadly as it floated in mid-air, aiming at the surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cold radiated from it, making the nearby air chill noticeably.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel moved closer, his presence crackling with energy. He raised his
          hand, and tiny arcs of electricity danced between his fingers. With a
          focused look, he directed his power toward the icicle. Lightning
          surged through the air, striking the ice. The effect was immediate and
          astonishing. The icicle began to pulse with electric energy, a deadly
          combination of ice and thunder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel had used his thunder element to charge the icicle with
          lightning. The end result was quite surprising; the ice pulsed with
          thunder as it levitated in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hum of electricity filled the air, creating a tense, charged
          atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          The area filled with a low hum, the charged air vibrating with
          potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          The icicle, now a lethal weapon, hovered menacingly, glowing with an
          eerie light. It was clear that if anyone were struck by this creation,
          their fate would be sealed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power radiating from it was palpable, strong enough to send
          shivers down the spine of anyone watching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel had a wide grin on his face as he looked at the terrifying
          creation of his; just one shot of this was enough to annihilate all
          his future enemies. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked towards Nadia as he made a thumbs-up gesture to her, but she
          ignored him, solely focused on the ice levitating in front of her.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Quite destructive, hmm," Sigfor commented while stroking his beard.
          He felt it was quite good for children their age.
        </p>
        <p>
          He doubted anyone around their age was capable of achieving a synergy
          with their elements to this level.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ice and Thunder were elements of destruction by nature. Being hybrid
          elements, they had more potency than normal elements.
        </p>
        <p>It was no surprise they managed to make this powerful attack.</p>
        <p>
          As he assessed the icicle charged with thunder, he felt the power
          behind the attack. It should be strong enough to obstruct a Rank-2
          exorcist for some moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Not bad at all. While this dumb brat is annoying, he has the skills.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder's eyes shone with a certain light as he looked at the
          floating icicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          'As expected from the heiress of the Mystic Purge Clan. That icicle is
          far from ordinary,' he thought to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The icicle radiated a certain frost, chilling the air around as if
          trying to freeze the air itself.
        </p>
        <p>Normal ice was not this potent. It was obvious she was special.</p>
        <p>
          He imagined them growing; with their potential, he had a feeling they
          might even catch up to their older generation—his generation—in terms
          of power and skills if they kept training hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elder, how do you like my—our special combination?" Daniel asked, the
          elder lost in his own thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is…" Sigfor looked at Daniel, who was looking at him with
          excitement, waiting to be praised, "…not bad."
        </p>
        <p>Daniel's expression soured when he heard the lacking remark.</p>
        <p>He retorted, "What do you mean by 'not bad,' elder?"</p>
        <p>
          "Is it great or not? Give a definite answer, please," he frowned and
          demanded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor sighed; this kid would definitely get complacent in the future.
        </p>
        <p>The elder's patience was wearing thin.</p>
        <p>
          "You both worked hard. The elemental combination has a certain
          destructive power that is rare to come by at your level of attacks. If
          you could pour more espera, it might even resist a Rank-2 exorcist's
          force for some time as well," Sigfor told them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "However, don't be too excited; this is all there is. Both of you
          still have room for a lot of improvement in the future. It's better
          that you don't become arrogant and look down on others. The world is
          vast, and there are geniuses everywhere," he added.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make his words sound more effective, he pointed his finger towards
          the floating icicle.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next moment, a short beam of gray light shot out from the tip of
          his finger, directly colliding with the icicle and destroying it as if
          it were glass hit with a hammer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, the gray light pierced through the ice and smashed into
          the barrier, producing a strong ripple in it.
        </p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel was looking at the scene with his jaw dropped. He turned his
          head from the ripple back to where the icicle was destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The small ice shards on the ground, laced with electricity, were proof
          of how powerful the thing Sigfor just did was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a single small move from Sigfor completely destroyed their
          combined elemental construct as if it were nothing.
        </p>
        <p>Daniel looked at the scene with a dumbfounded expression.</p>
