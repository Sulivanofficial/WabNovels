        <h2>Chapter 211 &nbsp;Hybrid fetus!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 211</p>
        <p>
          The chief simply bowed and said, his voice stiff with formal
          deference, "Sir, it is our negligence that damned heretics have
          infiltrated our peaceful city. I sincerely request you to exorcise
          this filth and stop them from dirtying our city."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry. Just maintain a distance from this area and ensure no
          one enters within range. I wouldn't want to endanger any civilians
          here." Oliver's tone was as cold as the night air, his focus already
          shifting to the task ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          His words, though calm, carried an undercurrent of authority that
          brooked no argument. The chief could sense it—this wasn't a matter of
          debate. No matter what, he still had to maintain a certain distinct
          authority as an exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded and walked past the policeman, entering the playground.
          The sound of his footsteps was soft, yet each one seemed to echo in
          the empty space.
        </p>
        <p>
          The officer glanced one more time at Oliver's back before making up
          his mind and leaving the premises quickly. There was something
          unsettling about the boy's quiet confidence, something that made the
          chief want to be far, far away from whatever was coming next.
        </p>
        <p>____________________</p>
        <p>
          "Sure enough, this thing has grown considerably since the last time."
          His eyes narrowed as he scanned the area, his special sight peeling
          back the layers of reality to expose the truth beneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver murmured while staring at a particular inconspicuous spot in
          front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a sliding swing made for children to play on. It looked
          extremely normal, and no one would be able to tell any difference at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>But beneath the mundane exterior, darkness festered.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver doubted even exorcists of the same rank as him would easily
          notice anything unusual at first glance. To the naked eye, it was just
          an ordinary playground, but to him, it was a site of something far
          more sinister. But he wasn't like other exorcists—his eyes saw the
          unseen, the hidden dangers others would walk past without a second
          thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, while the swing appeared quite normal externally, from his
          point of view, using his special eyes, he could see a fetus-like
          object swirling in a cocoon of darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fetus-shaped object was constantly rotating in a circular pattern,
          and it was growing at a speed visible to the naked eye. Each rotation
          seemed to pull in more darkness, feeding the twisted thing within. The
          changes were observable as more and more dark espera flooded into the
          cocoon from a faraway source.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver narrowed his eyes further and observed a string of dark espera
          attached to the swing. It pulsed like a living vein, carrying the
          taint from somewhere far beyond the playground. Shifting his line of
          sight, he noticed the string extending and shooting off to the east.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze followed it, his mind already calculating where it led and
          what awaited him at the end of that dark tether.
        </p>
        <p>
          From his research about the city layout earlier, he thought about the
          direction and felt it was close to where the majority of slums were
          located in the city.
        </p>
        <p>The pieces began to fall into place.</p>
        <p>
          He didn't need to guess much and was able to effortlessly connect the
          dots.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed that the heretics behind this whole stunt were hiding in the
          slums, controlling this thing from there. It wasn't just some random
          manifestation of evil—there was intent behind it, a guiding hand
          steering the dark espera from afar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver thought he could cut off the connection instantly using his own
          espera but stopped himself from doing so.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to know how deep the roots ran and how many heretics were
          running this little dark business in the city of normal civilians.
          There was more to uncover here. A mere exorcism wouldn't be enough—he
          needed to trace this back to the source.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was creepy how they had gone undetected so far. This city should
          have been frequented by traveling exorcists once in a while, but they
          hadn't found anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only when the organization suspected that there was a chance of
          the emergence of an artifact that the mission was assigned and he was
          sent here.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now the matter didn't seem limited to a simple artifact anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was something deeper at work here. Something far more dangerous
          than just a cursed playground.
        </p>
        <p>Badump! Badump!</p>
        <p>A loud heartbeat suddenly sounded in the silent playground.</p>
        <p>
          He paused as he looked back at the sliding swing, or more precisely,
          at the baby fetus-shaped thing that was growing even faster now.
        </p>

        <p>
          The darkness around it churned violently, as if it had sensed the
          approach of its final stage.
        </p>
        <p>Its speed of growth had accelerated for some reason!</p>
        <p>"Are they finally going to release it?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver squinted as he observed the flow of dark espera from the
          channel, which had also started to increase. It was as if the heretics
          were funneling more and more power into the creature, pushing it to
          full maturity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of a heartbeat echoed in his ears as the fetus seemed to
          expand, and the black mutant of a human-like thing was enlarging with
          every second.
        </p>
        <p>It looked like it was about to be born and emerge.</p>
        <p>
          It was no longer just a presence lurking in the shadows—this thing was
          about to be born.
        </p>
        <p>Boom! n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, the dark espera exploded, and Oliver was forced to back away
          for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the swing. A black humanoid being started to tear off the
          black cocoon that was enveloping it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's brows furrowed as he looked at the creature in disgust. The
          air around him grew foul, thick with the stench of decay and
          corruption. There was an overwhelming stench of decay radiating from
          the creature.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was nauseating and suffocating to be in the vicinity of such a
          thing.
        </p>
        <p>'What sort of thing is this? It's definitely not a demon.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver thought deeply. He knew well how demons felt and smelled.
          Moreover, he had never seen such a thing before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The creature had white irises like a human but, at the same time,
          three large mouths were hanging on the being's face, constantly
          exhaling a gray smoky mist.
        </p>
        <p>He frowned. The humanoid body, the human-like eyes, and mouth…</p>
        <p>'A hybrid?'</p>
        <p>_________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 212 &nbsp;Alchemists? Tough body!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 212</p>
        <p>'A sort of hybrid?'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's frown deepened as he suspected the possibility. The thing
          before him wasn't natural—it was a grotesque combination of things
          that should never have been merged. He felt more and more sure of his
          theory that the creature was not simply a demon or human, but a hybrid
          of the two.
        </p>
        <p>'The heretics have an alchemist with them?'</p>
        <p>
          He quickly realized that a heretic knowledgeable in alchemy was
          involved in this.
        </p>
        <p>
          This thing was a hybrid, a chimera. A monstrosity, crafted through
          dark science and forbidden rituals. He had read about them briefly
          from his tutor. These were imperfect dolls created with the aim of
          producing a being that possessed the powers and qualities of both
          humans and demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          An experiment to create a superior being above humans and demons. The
          heretics were trying to play god, and the result was standing right in
          front of him—a twisted abomination. This process was extremely
          sinister and demanded the lives of both demons and humans, a very
          serious criminal act in the society of exorcism.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such alchemists, who used these dark and sinister methods, were prime
          targets of the Exorcist Union.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was permitted to exorcise them on sight! n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          This was how dangerous these people were, and now he had encountered
          such a thing—an abomination that should not exist.
        </p>

        <p>
          If Oliver remembered correctly, to create a hybrid, a lot of resources
          and sacrifices were needed, not to mention an environment for that
          hybrid to grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          'So, this is what they've been planning?It looks like a deep plan
          they've been working on for a long time—too long.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't know many details about hybrids, and his knowledge was
          limited based on what he had been taught when he was younger.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was only told that this process was extremely cruel and frowned
          upon, even among demons, since it consumed many lives just to begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          And more lives were reaped to aid the growth process after its birth.
        </p>
        <p>
          'This thing has clearly just been born, but the dark espera radiating
          from its core is so overwhelming. No wonder such alchemists are hunted
          relentlessly. The number of lives consumed for this thing to be born
          must be significant.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver wasn't one to judge, but he still could not help but feel
          shocked. Looking at the creature tearing apart the cocoon, he felt
          goosebumps. his wasn't just a heretic's ploy—it was something far more
          insidious, and now it stood before him, growing stronger by the
          second.
        </p>
        <p>
          And this wasn't a heretic with fake strength but an actual chimera,
          and the strength it had was definitely real and dangerous!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes glinted with both disgust and caution. This creature was
          a real threat—one that required his full attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver lowered his arms as espera started to fluctuate violently
          behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air was heavy with an eerie stillness as the faint light of dawn
          barely pierced the foggy horizon. Oliver stood a few paces away, his
          eyes locked on the grotesque chimera emerging from the remnants of its
          cocoon.
        </p>

        <p>
          The creature's pitch-black humanoid form shuddered violently, three
          loose mouths hanging grotesquely from its chest, twisting and gaping
          as if trying to make sense of the world. It looked unnatural—an insult
          to both human and demon, a thing that shouldn't exist. Its eyes—cold,
          human-like—glowed with a menacing hunger for souls.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rapier suddenly appeared in his hand, retrieved from his mindspace.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's rapier trembled in his grip, not from fear, but from the
          weight of the situation. The tension in the air was almost palpable,
          his instincts screaming at him to act quickly. He calmly observed the
          chimera's behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rotting stench, which made Oliver's skin prickle and his senses
          sharpen, came from the chimera. The smell was thick, like decay left
          to rot for centuries—overpowering and vile. This creature was
          mindless, driven only by the urge to devour as many souls as it could.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the chimera tore the last shreds of its cocoon, Oliver's instincts
          screamed at him to strike first. He wasn't about to let this
          abomination gain the upper hand. He channeled his espera into his
          rapier, gripping it with resolve. The edges glowed faintly as he
          prepared his first move. He couldn't let this abomination have the
          advantage.
        </p>
        <p>[Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom]</p>
        <p>
          Without hesitation, Oliver used his best rapier technique, not wanting
          to hold back.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a swift step forward, Oliver's spear lashed out like a viper,
          cutting through the early morning mist. The movement was sharp,
          precise, with the intent to end the battle quickly. His strike was
          aimed at the chimera's chest, directly at the grotesque mouths.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rapier struck true—but instead of piercing flesh, it rebounded
          with a dull thud, the dark espera surrounding the chimera acting like
          a shield. The force of the impact reverberated up Oliver's arm, making
          his grip falter for a split second. A sharp, grating groan escaped
          from one of the creature's mouths, sending a shiver down Oliver's
          spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chimera instinctively blocked the rapier. It moved with a
          terrifying speed for something so monstrous. Although it had no
          intellect, it still had sharpened instincts and probably sensed the
          danger behind the rapier move.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tch, tougher than expected," Oliver muttered under his breath,
          leaping back as the chimera surged forward with terrifying speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its movement was almost unnatural, the way it lunged—half staggering,
          half sprinting—towards him. Its long, grotesque arms swiped at him,
          the claws gleaming with raw dark espera, lethal with every swing.
          Oliver dodged, barely avoiding the strike. His body flickered as he
          used the [Six Thoughtful Steps of the Spirit] his movement technique
          allowing him to blur out of sight momentarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world around him blurred as he shifted, reappearing just in time
          to dodge another vicious swipe. He appeared behind the chimera, hoping
          to catch it off guard, but the creature was relentless. It whirled
          around with unnatural agility, a wicked grin splitting across all
          three mouths.
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 213 &nbsp;First time being wounded?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 213</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's pulse quickened. He could feel the weight of the dark espera
          pressing down on him like a suffocating blanket. The creature's dark
          espera tried to crush him, bearing down like a weight on his chest. He
          needed to weaken it, or else it would be difficult to get close. Each
          breath felt heavier, the air around him thickening with the creature's
          corruption. Dark espera was especially harmful to exorcists with pure,
          untainted espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          He needed something more. Something potent enough to burn away this
          darkness. He raised his hand, black flames dancing at his fingertips.
        </p>
        <p>[Holy Flames of Nightmare]</p>
        <p>
          With a sharp thrust of his palm, the black flames burst forth and
          engulfed the chimera. The flames roared to life, scorching the ground
          beneath them as they wrapped around the creature. The flames howled as
          they licked at the dark espera, burning through the corrupted energy.
          For a moment, Oliver thought he had gained the upper hand. The chimera
          staggered, its grotesque form jerking as the holy flames gnawed at its
          flesh. The chimera staggered, its movements growing sluggish as the
          holy flames feasted on its defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          But then, with a bone-chilling roar, the creature surged forward,
          seemingly unfazed by the damage it had taken. It powered through the
          fire, a primal fury driving its limbs. It didn't stop. Instead, it let
          out a deafening roar that almost shattered Oliver's ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a furious bellow, the chimera lunged through the fire, ignoring
          the damage. Its claws came down like hammers, savage and fierce. Those
          terribly sharp claws scraped against Oliver's arm, tearing through his
          cloak and drawing blood.
        </p>
        <p>"What?"</p>
        <p>
          Pain flared up his arm, sharp and searing, as the creature's claws
          ripped into him.
        </p>

        <p>
          The searing pain jolted him as he was thrown back by the force of the
          blow. He skidded across the dirt, his breath ragged, eyes narrowing at
          the creature that now loomed over him. It was growing wilder, losing
          control, the dark espera around it pulsating violently. It was clear
          that the chimera was losing control, slowly going berserk.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't even bother healing itself, leaping into his flames without
          hesitation, catching him off guard for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chimera felt stronger than Jetia at this point, its power swelling
          as it absorbed more dark espera from the environment. Dark espera
          overflowed around it, shrouding the creature in a dense cloud of
          malevolent energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chimera lunged at him as Oliver rolled sideways, quickly trying to
          gain some distance between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its movements were erratic, but the raw strength behind each swipe was
          undeniable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chimera let out a low howl as the Holy Flames of Nightmare burned
          intensely on its body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Layers upon layers of dark espera slowly smothered the flames until
          they were completely extinguished from the chimera's tough hide.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Damn it…" Oliver gasped, clutching his bleeding arm. His heart raced
          as he struggled to catch his breath. The chimera was relentless, and
          it was getting stronger, feeding off the dark espera in the air. His
          strikes, his flames—they weren't enough to stop it. Not yet.
          n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          'Come to think of it, this is the first time a demonic being has
          actually managed to injure me.' He couldn't help but feel the gravity
          of the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he wasn't finished. His body screamed in protest, but his mind
          remained calm. Forcing himself to his feet, Oliver calmed his mind.
          The [Eternal Winter Physique] hummed inside him, his control over ice
          limited but present. He used a fine layer of ice to close his wound,
          stopping the bleeding with the help of frost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chill numbed the pain slightly, giving him a moment of clarity. As
          his arm healed, he raised his uninjured hand and summoned a wave of
          freezing air, attempting to slow the chimera's movements. The frost
          crept across the ground like a living thing, reaching out to entrap
          the creature.
        </p>

        <p>
          The frost spread across the ground, creeping up the creature's legs
          and binding it in place for a moment. It thrashed wildly, cracking the
          ice, but it bought him the time he needed.
        </p>
        <p>"This is going to hurt."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver dashed forward, calling upon his palm technique. His movements
          were swift, a blur of energy and precision as he closed in. His eyes
          locked onto the chimera's eerie, human-like eyes, determination
          burning behind his [Cosmic Void Gaze]. He wouldn't use it recklessly,
          just enough to seize the creature's attention and daze it.
        </p>
        <p>[Eternal Twelve Lies Palm]</p>
        <p>
          The air shimmered around Oliver's outstretched hand as twelve massive
          spectral giants appeared, their palms mirroring his own strike. Each
          palm was a projection of pure, condensed force, aiming to crush the
          chimera beneath their might. They descended on the chimera all at
          once, their blows crashing into the creature's body with the force of
          a mountain. The ground shook with each impact as the chimera howled in
          agony, its grotesque mouths twisting and contorting, unable to process
          the overwhelming assault.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even as the illusions struck, Oliver could feel it. The chimera's
          body was far from breaking. It was a beast driven by pure, chaotic
          hunger. The dark espera swirled violently around it, resisting the
          attack. The creature's body cracked, but it did not fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          A piercing shriek escaped the chimera's mouth as it curled its body to
          avoid the assault and minimize the damage. Its survival instincts were
          still intact, impressive for something so twisted. Even without
          intellect, it knew how to do such things, which impressed Oliver to
          some extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver staggered back, panting, sweat dripping from his brow. He had
          used too much espera already.
        </p>
        <p>
          His energy reserves were draining faster than he anticipated. It was
          most likely due to the excessive dark espera clouding his
          surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had there been another Rank-1 exorcist in his place, they would have
          long since drained their espera and become the chimera's breakfast.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can't keep up this pace forever…" he muttered, glaring at the
          creature as it rose from the aftermath of the palm strikes. Its eyes
          blazed with an unholy rage, its body pulsating with malevolent energy.
          Its eyes burned with rage, the dark espera around it swelling with
          malevolent energy. It was more ferocious now, the damage only making
          it more dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even without intelligence, the chimera already viewed him as a huge
          threat to its own existence, and its desire to kill surged even more.
        </p>
        <p>But...</p>
        <p>Did Oliver care?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 214 &nbsp;Hunter or Prey?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 214</p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't care about that; he and the chimera were already locked
          in a battle to the death, and the situation would only be resolved
          once one of them was finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air around them buzzed with tension, a silent acknowledgment that
          only one would walk away from this fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water condensed at his fingertips, swirling into form with practiced
          precision. It gathered in his palms, stretching slowly and shaping
          itself into a long, thin, translucent blue blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The water moved within the blade even as he held it. It rippled like
          liquid caught in suspended time, shimmering under the faint light of
          dawn. The blade was a pressurized hydraulic water weapon that Oliver
          had developed while training in the water chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't just water—it was destruction in liquid form, honed to a
          razor's edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water at high pressure can be sharp enough to cut through the toughest
          metals, and the blade was inspired by that principle—focused on
          sharpness and precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using quick movements, Oliver appeared before the chimera, and before
          the creature could react, he sliced forward with the hydraulic blade
          in a swift motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chimera's reaction was too slow. The blade hummed as it sliced
          through the air. The blade was a blur as it cut through the air, aimed
          with deadly precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          The blade cut through the air as it reached the chimera, which
          instinctively tried to block the sword with its long arms.
        </p>
        <p>Splatter!</p>

        <p>
          The chimera paused, stunned, as it looked down at where its long arm
          should have been—only to find a half-sliced elbow, cleanly severed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blood oozed from the clean cut, dark and viscous, as the creature let
          out a gurgling howl of pain. It clutched the stump of its arm, its
          grotesque mouths twitching in agony.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took a moment before sharp pain assaulted the senses of the dark
          chimera, making it recoil in fear and indignation as it looked at
          Oliver with wary eyes and a hint of fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chimera's body, which it thought was unbreakable and its greatest
          weapon, had been sliced apart flawlessly by the mysterious watery
          blade, as if slicing butter with a hot knife.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its confidence shattered, replaced by a creeping, primal terror. The
          chimera's entire body started to shake violently as it looked at
          Oliver. The moment it looked into Oliver's eyes, an unprecedented fear
          suddenly enveloped its whole being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two eyes as vast as the sky itself seemed to be gazing down at it in
          that moment; just the mere gaze weighed down as if thousands of
          mountains were raining from above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hybrid's body shook violently as it followed the closest instinct
          it could muster in the situation.
        </p>
        <p>Escape!</p>
        <p>
          Its mind might not have realized it, but the hybrid's tough,
          earlier-indestructible body had realized one fact…
        </p>
        <p>Oliver's presence was life-threatening!</p>
        <p>
          Those eyes held something ominous that gave birth to a primal feeling
          within its body. It was not just fear—it was the deep, gut-wrenching
          knowledge of impending doom.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was something that could not be explained in words but was
          unmistakably present.
        </p>

        <p>"Trying to run away?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver frowned, and his feet blurred into motion. Using his only
          movement technique, he gave chase to the chimera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground blurred beneath him as he closed the distance, relentless.
          No matter what, he could not let the hybrid enter the town.
        </p>
        <p>He had to confine it here at any cost and then exorcise it.</p>
        <p>
          If the hybrid started attacking civilians, not only would it quickly
          grow stronger, but it would also cause a massive commotion, and his
          mission might become very difficult.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but his presence could also become known to his clan
          and to others far and wide, which would put a firm end to all his
          future plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything he had worked for would unravel in an instant. He could not
          allow that at any cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although the chimera's physical strength was beyond what a rank-1
          exorcist could compete with, it was not an issue for Oliver. With his
          own absurd strength, keeping up with the chimera was easy.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          The hydraulic blade moved again as a terrifying wave of water swept
          over the chimera's entire body, leaving multiple blade marks. Each cut
          was precise, designed to disable, not kill. Vicious green, mucus-like
          blood started to pour like a fountain from those sharp wounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hybrid hissed painfully as it fearfully ran in any direction, just
          to get away from Oliver, who was tailing it like a wild beast.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was almost comical how their roles had reversed at this moment—the
          chimera, a dark beast that should have been chasing after the prey,
          was now being relentlessly pursued by that very prey.
        </p>

        <p>The hunter had become the hunted.</p>
        <p>"Humph."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver snorted as the chimera tried its best to dodge and make him
          lose its trail. It was desperate, but no amount of frantic running
          would save it now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their figures turned into small lights as they clashed against each
          other in the playground. The sun was slowly starting to rise, and the
          area was brightening.
        </p>
        <p>
          The playground had suffered clear marks of destruction from the battle
          between two supernatural forces—everything was vivid and fresh.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          A loud sound echoed in the quiet morning as Oliver once again sliced
          off the chimera's limb, this time its left leg.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hybrid roared furiously, collapsing to the ground, unable to
          balance itself to escape further.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was lucky that the hybrid before him didn't seem to have
          developed any regenerative abilities, or it would have truly turned
          into a nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hybrid looked at Oliver, who was calmly staring at it, and felt
          restless, anxiously dragging itself away.
        </p>
        <p>It could sense its own end creeping closer.</p>
        <p>"It's time to face your exorcism."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes turned cold as he muttered, and in the next moment, a
          torrent of pitch-black flames engulfed the chimera whole!
        </p>
        <p>Roar!</p>
        <p>
          It was a fierce roar of struggle from a beast at its end. Even after
          losing its mind, the chimera still did not dare to approach Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fear instilled into the chimera was so strong that, even at its
          end, it tried to escape from Oliver, who was standing still, watching
          the hybrid crawl.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if the mere presence of the boy was enough to drive the
          creature mad with terror.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 215 &nbsp;Something seems off? The heretic's confusion</h2>
        <p>Chapter 215</p>
        <p>
          The reason Oliver wasn't moving was not because he was enjoying the
          chimera's final moments of struggle, but because he was observing
          something more profound and deeper above it.
        </p>
        <p>There was something else—something hidden within its dying form.</p>
        <p>
          His eyes shone with a mysterious light as he looked at the thousands
          of blurry gray wisps of light that were leaving or breaking out of the
          chimera's body as it withered away in the holy flames of nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>'Are these…?'</p>
        <p>'…the souls of the deceased?'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked intently at the cluster of gray wisps. He didn't know
          beforehand what they were, but his intuition told him exactly what
          they were.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hybrid was a being made with the help of others' souls, so it
          wasn't hard for him to guess what those clusters of light were. As the
          chimera reached its end, the souls were released from the confines of
          its body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dark alchemists used sinister methods to stitch souls into the
          chimera's body so they could no longer escape, forcing them to suffer
          eternally while serving as fuel for the hybrid indefinitely.
        </p>
        <p>It was a fate worse than death, a torment beyond comprehension.</p>
        <p>
          'They sacrificed a lot of people… how did they manage to go unnoticed
          for so long? Did they collect souls from somewhere else before
          arriving here?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had many speculations about the matter, but at the moment, he
          was more focused on the souls of the deceased floating in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          They seemed lost, wandering without purpose, tethered to this world by
          the violence of their deaths.
        </p>

        <p>
          They gave him a strong feeling of resemblance to the spirits he
          encountered when training under Sigfor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The difference was that the spirits were colorful and denser compared
          to the monotonous souls here.
        </p>
        <p>"Sigh, what a mess," he said to himself.</p>
        <p>
          "I can't let this huge number of souls disperse into the atmosphere…"
        </p>
        <p>
          From a novel he had read, he knew that letting out this many souls in
          raw form would cause them to become contaminated, turning into wild
          ghosts that would create chaos.
        </p>
        <p>It would be a terrible outcome for everyone involved later.</p>
        <p>
          Usually, there were certain exorcism techniques that could allow souls
          to leave peacefully without turning malevolent.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the issue was that he didn't know any such techniques. In the
          novel, these techniques were taught at the institute.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he wasn't in a novel, and this wasn't the time to worry about
          things he couldn't control.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was also in no position to let the souls roam freely like this.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm…"</p>
        <p>
          A certain look appeared in his eyes as he remembered what happened
          when he was summoned to the partial spirit world.
        </p>
        <p>At that time, his abyss energy had gotten a certain boost…</p>
        <p>
          The memory flickered in his mind, bringing with it a strange mix of
          temptation and hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>Well…</p>

        <p>
          Would he become a cannibal if he did the same thing to the souls here?
        </p>
        <p>"Erm… this…"</p>
        <p>
          He became a little flustered at the thought. He had to do something
          about the situation, and his options were limited to just one.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am sorry, my human fellows, or maybe some demon fellows who got
          mixed up in this cluster. I must do this for the sake of world peace."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked sorrowful for a moment, and before anyone could even
          react, a large amount of corrupt reddish-black energy instantly
          engulfed the large cluster of souls and disappeared in less than a
          second.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had used a little of his abyss energy earlier and could feel a
          strong boost to his initially low reserves. However, it wasn't as
          significant as the time when he consumed the partial spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt different, weaker somehow, like the souls were lacking
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, it made sense since most of these souls belonged to powerless
          humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Wait, I won't be called a killer now, right?' He frowned and quickly
          shook off the useless thoughts. What's done was done.
        </p>
        <p>There was no undoing it now.</p>
        <p>
          "It's all for the greater good," he told himself as he watched the
          chimera's body completely extinguish, and the dark espera thread
          connected to it suddenly broke.
        </p>
        <p>
          It meant that the control and connection with the heretics had been
          destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>"Now then, what should I do?"</p>
        <p>
          He looked thoughtful as he stared at the sky for a moment before
          deciding on his next action.
        </p>

        <p>
          The morning light was starting to creep into the horizon, but his task
          was far from over.
        </p>
        <p>
          He noticed the faint trail of dark espera, as thin as a thread,
          extending into the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at the chimera, or what remained of it, and saw something
          that caught his eye on its body. Without a second thought, he stored
          the hybrid's remains in his mindspace.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt a large amount of space being taken up by this sudden action.
          He was still not proficient in using abyss energy, and his level of
          abyss energy was still too low. From the cryptic knowledge he had
          obtained last time, he knew the stronger his abyss energy became, the
          vaster his mindspace would be in the future.
        </p>
        <p>It was limitless.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver then quickly followed the slowly disappearing thread of dark
          espera, heading directly toward where the heretics responsible for the
          whole situation were most likely hiding.
        </p>
        <p>
          He moved quickly, every second wasted increasing the risk of losing
          his lead.

        <p>In the underground dark chamber n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om</p>
        <p>A few hours ago</p>
        <p>
          Two heretics were seated in meditative positions facing one another.
          The woman was responsible for manipulating the dark espera and
          controlling the hybrid's consciousness, while the man's role was to
          keep reciting a script from an ancient scroll he held—which must not
          be stopped while the woman concentrated on controlling the chimera.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was crucial that he continued until the woman stopped herself
          first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their main goal was the revival of their lord and the restoration of
          their dark sect's heritage to how it used to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          To achieve that, they needed to direct the chimera toward them and
          have it merge with the decaying skull placed between them. This skull,
          inscribed with runic characters, would allow their lord to possess the
          chimera and help him revive.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could not directly bring the hybrid fetus back to this
          underground base, as the conditions for it to be born required strict
          environments best suited for the playground.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had planned everything carefully. They would let the hybrid be
          born, then allow it to rampage in the city to grow stronger before
          ordering it back to the underground base, where they would use it to
          revive their lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their victory was all but assured—at least, that's what they believed.
        </p>
        <p>Everything was flawless…</p>
        <p>It was supposed to be flawless, at least.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 216 &nbsp;Celestial Paradox Clan!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 216</p>
        <p>Everything was flawless…</p>
        <p>It was supposed to be flawless, at least.</p>
        <p>
          The man who was constantly reading the scroll and mumbling incoherent
          words glanced at the woman. He could see a tense expression on her
          face as she frowned deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a stiffness in her posture, a trembling in her fingers that
          she couldn't hide.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her brows were furrowed, and beads of sweat had gathered at their
          base, slowly sliding down her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is she having difficulty controlling the hybrid? It shouldn't be that
          strong yet to pose any issues…'
        </p>
        <p>
          A sense of foreboding emerged in the man's heart as he observed his
          partner's uneasy expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was obvious to him that something was wrong, but he still
          suppressed the anxiety and doubt in his mind, attributing it to the
          chimera being too powerful and complex for them to control.
        </p>
        <p>And yet, the seed of fear was planted.</p>
        <p>Then, something happened.</p>
        <p>A horrible retching sound cut through the still air.</p>
        <p>"Cough!"</p>
        <p>
          The woman, who had her eyes closed, opened them wide and vomited blood
          all over.
        </p>
        <p>"I-Impossible…"</p>

        <p>"What!? What happened!?"</p>
        <p>The man stood up in alarm, no longer continuing the chant.</p>
        <p>
          He could feel his own heartbeat quicken, dread sinking into his gut.
        </p>
        <p>"D-Dead…"</p>
        <p>
          The man's expression changed wildly when he heard the woman's weak
          whisper.
        </p>
        <p>"What is it? What do you mean by dead?"</p>
        <p>
          He couldn't help but ask, though his gut was already in his throat,
          and his doubts and suspicions were at their peak.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman's complexion was pale and unsightly, with blood staining her
          white face. Her hollow eyes and broad nose made her look extremely
          hideous in that moment.
        </p>
        <p>Her breathing was ragged, and the trembling in her body worsened.</p>
        <p>
          "Say something!" the man urged her, dying inside at the thought that
          their years of preparation might have just collapsed.
        </p>
        <p>"The fetus is…"</p>
        <p>
          "The fetus? What happened to it?" The man could no longer remain calm.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's… dead." The woman let out a small voice, a dazed look in her
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"WHAT!? Explain clearly right now!" the man demanded.</p>
        <p>
          "I… the fetus was born, and I managed to successfully establish a
          connection to it, but suddenly I felt it go still, as if some sort of
          obstruction was happening around it as the connection grew faint. I
          tried to see what was happening but couldn't."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And then… all of a sudden, the hybrid died, and I, who was connected
          to its mind, suffered the shock. My espera has been drained, and I
          feel that even my core has suffered," she said in a gloomy voice.
        </p>

        <p>
          The core was the source of espera they had formed with the help of
          demons. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an imitation of a demon's heart, which was often their source
          of espera as well.
        </p>
        <p>Any damage to it could be fatal in many cases.</p>
        <p>
          The weight of her words sank into the man like stones, pulling him
          deeper into despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It looks like our plans have been exposed." The man forcefully calmed
          himself and thought about his next course of action.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wrap up. We are leaving this city and will probably be laying low for
          some years now," he told the woman, who looked at him with a sour
          expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing this, the man sighed. "I know what you're feeling, but the
          opponents aren't something we can handle on our own, especially given
          your situation right now."
        </p>
        <p>
          She glared at him, but her expression softened. He was right, and she
          hated it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Damn those exorcists!" the woman cursed, but she still got up in the
          end. Her partner was right; it wasn't the time to be angry. If they
          survived, they could rebuild everything.
        </p>
        <p>The revival of their lord was what mattered most.</p>
        <p>
          Just as the man was about to gather their things, his hair stood on
          end as he instinctively deployed all of his dark espera at once,
          blocking a terrifying sword swing aimed at his back.
        </p>
        <p>Crash!</p>
        <p>
          Despite his efforts, he was sent flying, crashing into the walls of
          the dimly lit basement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who are you!?" the woman screamed, her voice filled with vigilance,
          as she looked behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lights in the basement flickered as an ominous aura suddenly
          filled the small room.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a suffocating presence, like the very air had thickened around
          them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The flickering lights, coupled with the sudden chill in the air, sent
          shivers down the woman's spine. Squinting, she saw a figure in the
          corner of the basement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her heart nearly jumped to her throat. How long had that figure been
          there? Why couldn't either of them sense it?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was like a scene straight out of a horror movie—except it wasn't a
          movie; it was real life.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the light flickered more, the woman made out the sight of gleaming
          white hair, and a voice stirred her heart with tension.

        <p>"P-Please spare us…"</p>
        <p>
          "W-We were wrong, cousin. From today onwards, we'll never interfere
          with you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I swear on my name that I'll never cross your path again. Please let
          us live."
        </p>
        <p>
          Five children, around Oliver's age, knelt on a stone platform, begging
          for their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          In front of them was a familiar girl with shiny golden hair and
          gem-like red eyes. She stared at the group with a nerve-wracking
          intensity, making them tremble in fear even more.
        </p>
        <p>None of them dared to meet her eyes, prostrating before her.</p>
        <p>The air around them was heavy, their desperation palpable.</p>
        <p>
          All of them shared one thing in common: severe bruises and deep wounds
          on their bodies, as if they had just been beaten to the verge of death
          moments ago.
        </p>
        <p>The girl was none other than Evelyn.</p>
        <p>
          She wore an expressionless facade as she looked at her so-called
          cousins from the branch families.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her gaze was cold, unfeeling, as though they were nothing more than
          insects beneath her boot.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were related to her in name only. None of them had ever shown any
          intention of forming a sibling relationship with her. All of them were
          snakes, trying to root her out.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had conspired together and tried to cripple her during the clan's
          event, but she managed to face their disgusting schemes with strength
          and will.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, after the event, she brought up their actions, but they all
          denied it to her face and even accused her of unknown crimes,
          intending to push her into a deep pit.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 217 &nbsp;Who interfered?</h2>
        <p>
          cles and aunts whom she once held in high regard didn't interfere and
          watched from the sidelines with snickering smiles as she fell deeper
          and deeper into the web of lies their children had prepared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their smirks were like daggers, twisting deeper as each false
          testimony piled on.
        </p>
        <p>
          She realized too late that they were just as involved in everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her parents were people of important positions and usually didn't have
          the time to attend clan events.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she felt that her strict father, even if he had been present,
          would not have interfered. Would he have helped? She doubted it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would have simply considered this a test for her to overcome and
          display her abilities as the potential future head of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this time of war, there was no place for weaklings. Support would
          be provided when necessary, but individual ability was valued above
          all else.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, things escalated, and even the elders had to get involved in the
          conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, her cousins proposed a death duel, where opponents were allowed
          to kill each other without consequences. It was a barbaric duel that
          was highly frowned upon by her clan members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, the elder opposed this as well since it was idiotic for
          potential powerful exorcist seedlings to battle each other to death
          over trivial, childish matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the elder was later pressured by her uncles and aunts and had
          to permit the duel to take place.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then that Evelyn realized how deeply rotten her family truly
          was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's trust in her cousins and other relatives hit rock-bottom
          after that. They really wanted to kill her to seize more power and
          control in the clan's future.
        </p>

        <p>
          She had always considered them her family, but they wanted to drown
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each betrayal chipped away at her faith in blood ties, leaving nothing
          but bitterness.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wondered if this was all there was to relationships in this world.
          Were all the people she was close with like this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Only maintaining relationships with her for their own benefit, with no
          mutual feelings of growth or familial love?
        </p>
        <p>Was this how families in other major clans were too?</p>
        <p>She thought of her friends—Oliver, Daniel, Amber, Alphonso…</p>
        <p>Were their clans like this too?</p>
        <p>Were their siblings also after their lives to gain more power?</p>
        <p>She shook her head. She doubted it was this bad for others.</p>
        <p>
          But she felt that Oliver and Nadia from the Mystic Purge Clan must
          have faced similar situations to hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the infamous rumors of cold-blooded nature and the intense power
          struggles in that clan, she felt it was highly likely that those two
          had also been constantly targeted by their relatives.
        </p>
        <p>
          From what her elders had told her about the clan, Nadia was most
          likely to succeed as the next head of the Mystic Purge family. Maybe
          she had her own special circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          That only left Oliver. Of all the others, Evelyn felt Oliver was the
          most normal, just like her. In a way, whenever she compared them, she
          found that Oliver matched her vibe the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a calmness about him that reminded her of herself, or at least
          who she used to be.
        </p>

        <p>He was neither overly cautious nor overly reckless.</p>
        <p>He was just like…</p>
        <p>Just like her sister.</p>
        <p>
          For a moment, she felt a strong sense of familiarity with Oliver.
          Unlike her, he was stronger and always had this friendly and
          approachable demeanor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he was good with crowds and had a great deal of
          charisma, just like her sister.
        </p>
        <p>
          She suddenly realized she had a lot to improve. Her eyes turned
          determined as she thought about what Oliver would have done in such a
          scenario.
        </p>
        <p>Would he have suffered a setback and become depressed?</p>
        <p>
          Would he have been swallowed by defeat? Let them win by sinking into
          despair?
        </p>
        <p>
          No. He would have hardened his will even more and moved forward with
          even greater vigor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her blood began to boil as adrenaline pumped through her body. If he
          could rise after falling, why couldn't she? If he could do it, then
          what was her excuse?
        </p>
        <p>
          If she wanted to achieve her goal and bring peace to this world, she
          could no longer afford to be depressed by such trivial matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were going to be countless people trying to obstruct her path
          toward her goal. She would have to rise above them, utilize their
          schemes, and turn them into stepping stones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hands tightened into fists. She wasn't going to let them bury her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had promised herself to reach a level where she could stand on
          equal footing with her sister and Oliver. There was no way she was
          backing out now.
        </p>

        <p>
          She took a deep breath and glanced at her fake siblings, then at their
          parents in the audience—her so-called uncles and aunts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their expressions were ironic, completely opposite to what they had
          been at the beginning—anger, panic, desperation…
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet all they could do was watch despite all that. The duel was sacred,
          and the elders were witnesses. No one was allowed to interfere once it
          began until the winner chose to end it.
        </p>
        <p>"Evelyn! Stop right now!"</p>
        <p>
          One of the middle-aged women shouted in desperation as she looked at
          the girl and then at her son lying before her.
        </p>
        <p>"Ha…" Evelyn couldn't help but let out a sarcastic laugh.</p>
        <p>She didn't feel anger. Just… pity.</p>
        <p>
          "Evelyn! What do you mean? There's no need to go so far between
          siblings," a man said in a loud, overbearing voice that reverberated
          throughout the arena.
        </p>
        <p>"Siblings?" She muttered the word, finding it laughable now.</p>
        <p>
          "Noisy," Evelyn mumbled. Her eyes darkened, tired of the hypocrisy
          surrounding her. How hypocritical of them to say this now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though her tone was low, in the silent stadium filled with
          exorcists, everyone could hear what she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You!" The man's expression changed as veins popped on his forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn ignored the man and raised her hand high. Joining her index
          finger with her middle finger, she formed a seal.
        </p>
        <p>It looked as if she was about to make the final move.</p>
        <p>
          But suddenly, the winds in the arena intensified, and a rumbling sound
          filled the stadium. It was as if an earthquake was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sky seemed to darken, the atmosphere shifting as something ancient
          and powerful stirred.
        </p>
        <p>Evelyn was also distracted by this unexpected event.</p>
        <p>
          Then, a very old and aged voice sounded in the arena, making everyone
          tremble.
        </p>
        <p>"Stop."</p>
        <p>____________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 218 &nbsp;Give face? Or...?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 218</p>
        <p>
          The voice echoed as all of the onlookers were stunned, seeing a figure
          floating in the sky above the stadium. The person was an old woman
          dressed in pristine white clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air seemed to crackle with authority, as if her mere arrival had
          shifted the balance of power in the stadium.
        </p>
        <p>"Elder Payne!"</p>
        <p>
          A series of exclamations followed as the people below recognized the
          old woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone knew her as one of the branch elders of the clan. She had
          great prestige, and her strength was profound.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not someone who appeared without reason, and for her to be
          here now meant something serious was about to happen.
        </p>
        <p>For her to appear at this moment could only mean one thing…</p>
        <p>She was here to save the other heirs from being killed!</p>
        <p>
          The uncles and aunts in the audience chamber saw this and felt
          relieved. Now that the elder had interfered, they believed they would
          not have to suffer much longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Relief washed over them like a tidal wave. Finally, their children
          would be spared from Evelyn's wrath.
        </p>
        <p>Evelyn glanced up at the sky and met the elder's gaze.</p>

        <p>
          "What do you mean by that, Elder?" she calmly asked. "The duel was
          just and fair and took place under the proper witnesses. According to
          the rules, I am allowed to claim their lives."
        </p>
        <p>Her words were cold, even though she spoke calmly.</p>
        <p>
          There was no malice in her tone, just a chilling truth that left no
          room for sentiment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elder Payne was unfazed by her cold words. She simply said, "Let this
          matter go. You've already made them miserable."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why should I spare them when they tried to take my life? I don't
          think they would have spared me if I were in their position right
          now." Evelyn's eyes flickered as her emotions threatened to spill out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her heart pounded in her chest, a storm of anger and frustration
          raging beneath her calm exterior.
        </p>
        <p>
          She controlled the tears that were ready to burst at any moment,
          putting on a brave front as she calmly asked the elder in front of
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt frustrated and angry. Why was the elder interfering now? Why
          hadn't she interfered earlier when they were all ganging up against
          her?
        </p>
        <p>
          Where was this interference when she had been fighting alone against
          their cruelty?
        </p>
        <p>A tight knot formed in her heart, and her throat felt heavy.</p>
        <p>
          The elder, unmoved, said, "You all represent the future of the clan
          and are cherished talents. It does not make sense for them to die
          here."
        </p>
        <p>
          The words stung, each one feeling like a dismissal of her own worth.
          "Them." Not "you all."
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn smiled bitterly. Even now, the elder said "them" and not "you
          all," which meant she didn't consider Evelyn's opinion at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Would you have interfered if I were in their shoes?" she asked,
          controlling her trembling voice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite being just a kid, she was controlling herself better than
          anyone right now. She refused to shed tears, knowing they would mock
          her later if she broke down.
        </p>
        <p>She wasn't going to let them see her weakness—not now. Not ever.</p>
        <p>The elder was silent for a moment before replying.</p>
        <p>"Of course. I would have saved you too."</p>
        <p>Lies.</p>
        <p>
          The elder was lying with such a straight face that Evelyn felt even
          more bitter. Such a fake display of affection repulsed her.
        </p>
        <p>
          How many more lies would she have to swallow before they stopped
          treating her like a fool?
        </p>
        <p>Was being kind equivalent to being taken as a fool?</p>
        <p>
          She took a deep breath and placed her hand on her chest. Her heartbeat
          was racing; she needed to calm down and not let the elder's powerful
          aura suppress her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She coldly looked at the floating elder and then turned her gaze back
          to her kneeling siblings. Some of them wore mocking expressions,
          feeling as if they were already saved and laughing at her inability in
          their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I refuse," Evelyn boldly said as she resumed the hand seal she had
          formed earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her voice rang out like a final judgment, sharp and cutting through
          the air.
        </p>
        <p>The siblings who had been snickering now looked at her in terror.</p>

        <p>
          "EVELYN!" The elder's aura flared up, clearly agitated. "Give me face
          for now and let them go."
        </p>
        <p>
          She used her prestige and name. This statement of "giving her face"
          indirectly meant that the elder would later owe her a favor, and that
          Evelyn should not push further. If she did anything now, it would be
          akin to disrespecting the elder's authority and reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't just a request—it was a demand, cloaked in tradition and
          authority. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          It basically meant, "Do me a favor by maintaining my dignity or
          reputation in this moment." The implication was that the elder
          expected her to hold back, and in return, she might address the issue
          later or show appreciation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Face?" Evelyn's voice, laced with sarcasm, sounded in the silent
          stadium.
        </p>
        <p>
          She almost laughed at the absurdity of it. She wanted her to show
          leniency?
        </p>
        <p>If that's what she wanted, then…</p>
        <p>"Sure. I'll give you some face."</p>
        <p>
          With that, she swiped her hand down, and five beams of white light
          shot out from her, directly entering the bodies of her five siblings.
        </p>
        <p>"AARGH!"</p>
        <p>"It hurts…!"</p>
        <p>"Help me!"</p>
        <p>
          The elder's expression changed as she saw what the girl had done, yet
          she couldn't stop her. The duel ground was under the surveillance of
          the main elders, and she dared not overstep her bounds.
        </p>
        <p>Her hands were tied by the very laws she sought to uphold.</p>
        <p>
          All she could do was persuade Evelyn from the outside. She hadn't
          expected the little girl to be so vicious and clever.
        </p>
        <p>
          She hadn't killed them, as the elder had asked, but instead, she had
          directly crippled the five of them with her espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          What's more, she had used a special technique while doing so, one
          exclusive to the clan. This technique was an extension of sealing
          exorcism.
        </p>
        <p>A technique that was only made to be used on vicious demons.</p>
        <p>___________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 219 &nbsp;Bella's special condition! Evelyn's worry!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 219</p>
        <p>
          The light beams that crippled the five kids belonged to Evelyn, and
          now their veins and hearts were permanently sealed with her espera.
          Unless she released the lock, no amount of elixirs could restore their
          ability to use espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a technique often used on captured demons to prevent them from
          retaliating.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since she didn't kill them, this was essentially the equivalent of
          "giving face" in front of the public.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had turned the elder's own words against her—cleverly bending the
          rules without breaking them.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had outwitted the elder, following her words to the letter while
          exacting her own form of justice.
        </p>
        <p>The elder had no excuse to find trouble with her later either.</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn had given her "face," but in the most ruthless way possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigh… this girl truly bears the blood of the clan master. Such
          decisiveness at her age and mastery of techniques. Her cunning was
          beyond her years. She could almost see the clan head's image
          overlapping with Evelyn in her mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder glanced at the people from her branch family and thought,
          These fools have really made me lose face today in front of the
          younger generation. I fear I'll have to stay in seclusion for a while,
          lest the other elders try to damage my reputation further after this.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt a pang of anger in her calm heart. They had begged her to
          intervene when they could no longer control the situation. Their
          incompetence had cost her dearly. This wouldn't have happened if they
          had thought things through more carefully.
        </p>
        <p>They had pushed too far and underestimated the consequences.</p>
        <p>
          'At least they're not dead.' She shook her head, glanced one last time
          at Evelyn's back, and disappeared from the stadium. Her pride wounded,
          but her honor salvaged—barely. In the future, she would owe a favor to
          this clever girl.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Humph." Evelyn snorted as she headed back to her residence. Her
          heart, however, was far from calm. It was a fitting punishment for
          them—they would now repent for their whole lives.
        </p>
        <p>But the bitterness of the day lingered in her thoughts.</p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>
          She soon reached a residence. It was not hers, but Bella's. She wanted
          to drop by and see how her sister was doing since she didn't attend
          the duel…
        </p>
        <p>
          No, it would be more appropriate to say that she hadn't come out of
          her residence much since they returned from training in the mountains.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her interactions with her sisters had decreased a lot during this
          time, so she couldn't help but worry that something was going on with
          her sister.
        </p>
        <p>
          She entered the residence without any guards stopping her, as it was
          not unusual for her to visit her sister unannounced.
        </p>
        <p>
          She soon approached her sister's room and was about to knock when she
          suddenly froze in her tracks. Her hand was suspended mid-air as she
          heard something from behind the door.
        </p>
        <p>Her heart pounded in her chest.</p>
        <p>"Cough, cough…"</p>
        <p>
          It was a violent coughing sound, as if the person was seriously ill.
        </p>
        <p>A terrible dread gripped Evelyn, freezing her in place.</p>
        <p>
          "I must not let it consume my mind and heart… I cannot afford to die
          here… Cough."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was her sister's voice, but she seemed to be in a terrible state at
          the moment.
        </p>
        <p>What?</p>

        <p>Consume my mind and heart?</p>
        <p>Die?</p>
        <p>What did she mean?</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's heart leaped to her throat as she burst through the door with
          force and barged inside.
        </p>
        <p>"Sister!"</p>
        <p>
          Her expression changed wildly as she saw Bella lying weakly on her
          bed, blood leaking from her mouth. The floor was stained with patches
          of blood, and her eyes were dizzy.
        </p>
        <p>"Sister! What happened!?"</p>
        <p>Evelyn immediately reached out to support Bella.</p>
        <p>
          "I'll call the medics right now!" she practically screamed, about to
          call the guards when Bella stopped her.
        </p>
        <p>"No. Stop…"</p>
        <p>Bella's voice was so faint, it barely registered.</p>
        <p>
          "What do you mean, sister? You're bleeding so much. Something is wrong
          with your body!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's fine," Bella, now supported by her sister, said in a faint
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>It didn't seem fine at all—Evelyn's mind raced with fear.</p>

        <p>"No, but—"</p>
        <p>
          "Calm down, Eve." Bella's gentle voice stopped the restless Evelyn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn knew her sister understood her own condition better than
          anyone. She would have been the first to call for the medics if it had
          been necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was unbelievable that she had been hiding something like this. Her
          condition was clearly not right, but she hadn't told them?
        </p>
        <p>Why? Why didn't she say anything?</p>
        <p>
          "Sister, I want an explanation," Evelyn demanded in a stern voice. Her
          heart was pounding so loudly it felt like the whole room could hear
          it. There was no room for carelessness when it came to Bella's health.
          No matter what, if Bella didn't satisfy her with an explanation, she
          would tell their mother directly. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella looked helpless as she gazed at her sister's resolute
          expression, knowing she couldn't brush this matter aside or make any
          excuses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn cared deeply for her and wouldn't hesitate to do whatever she
          could for her health.
        </p>
        <p>"Well, how do I start…" Bella made a complicated expression.</p>
        <p>
          "Just tell me everything. It's not like we'll judge you," Evelyn said
          in a soft voice, comforting Bella.
        </p>
        <p>Her heart softened, but the anxiety still gripped her tightly.</p>
        <p>"I was diagnosed with MCS."</p>
        <p>"Huh?"</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn wore a blank expression as she asked, "Sister, what is that?"
        </p>
        <p>"Magnetic Convergence Syndrome."</p>
        <p>
          Bella sighed as she looked at her sister's confused face and began to
          explain slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "MCS is a rare and dangerous affliction that affects individuals with
          magnetism as their prime element. There's a reason why so few people
          have magnetism as their primary element. Teacher Alison had taken me
          to her friend, who also shared the same element as me. But upon
          reaching there, we were informed of this syndrome."
        </p>
        <p>Bella took a deep breath and continued.</p>
        <p>Each word felt heavier than the last.</p>
        <p>She soon explained what exactly was going on?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 220 &nbsp;Magnetic Convergence Syndrome</h2>
        <p>Chapter 220</p>
        <p>
          "This is a rare problem that only affects individuals with the
          magnetism element, and even among them, it's particularly concerning
          for those with stronger affinities. Over time, their internal magnetic
          field grows unstable, gradually attracting and binding ferromagnetic
          materials—iron, nickel, cobalt, etc.—from the environment, which
          damages them internally in later stages."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The person examined my condition and quickly realized that I was
          already close to the last stage. But I hadn't suffered or shown any
          symptoms before, and the person said it was due to my expertise in
          controlling the element. In a way, my talent became my curse when I
          learned the reason."
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella's words hung heavy in the air. The weight of her condition
          pressed down on them both, as if the very atmosphere had thickened.
        </p>
        <p>
          She whispered in a low tone, appearing sorrowful and a bit dejected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn stared at her sister, speechless. Her chest felt tight, as if
          the weight of Bella's words was crushing her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn was shocked after hearing all this information for the first
          time in her life. She hadn't even realized that her sister had been
          suffering through such things for so long.
        </p>
        <p>How could I not have noticed?</p>
        <p>How did I not see this? How could I not know?</p>
        <p>
          "Then these symptoms… why did they appear only now?" she couldn't help
          but ask Bella.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Well, the person helped me suppress it to some extent—or more like
          put a temporary solution to the problem—which led to my worsening
          condition. Otherwise, I would have been completely unaware until the
          very end. Although the condition was suppressed, it has been raging
          even more lately."
        </p>
        <p>
          Raging... like a storm inside her that had been kept at bay, but now
          it was breaking free.
        </p>
        <p>"Sister…"</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn bit her lip, feeling her sister's predicament. She could not
          understand why her sister, who was usually so energetic and cheerful,
          would suddenly lock herself in her room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I heard you talking about dying earlier. Is… is this really that
          serious?" she asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella nodded and explained, "Normally, there are a few stages in this
          condition. For those lucky enough, their symptoms quickly show up in
          the beginning stages. It usually involves disrupting the surroundings,
          attracting metals and machinery to the individual, making daily life a
          hell. You know it can be painful or even dangerous if large objects
          are drawn towards them. Metal fragments may embed in their skin,
          causing injuries."
        </p>
        <p>"But you…" Evelyn paused, her meaning clear as day.</p>
        <p>
          "Didn't I tell you?" Bella smiled wryly. "According to Teacher, I was
          so adept at controlling the element that I never experienced such a
          thing."
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's heart ached at that. Bella's talent, once a source of pride,
          had betrayed her in the most cruel way.
        </p>
        <p>"What about the later stages?" Evelyn asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Well, in the later stages, the body's magnetic field itself starts
          affecting the normal functions of the organs, especially the heart,
          which operates through electrical signals," Bella replied.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The heart works using electrical signals? What does that mean,
          sister? Is there electricity in your body?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn couldn't help but feel confused. It was natural—she was still
          not mature enough to understand such complex stuff, no matter how
          talented she was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella shook her head. "I didn't know much either. I simply asked the
          person, and they explained a few things. Apparently, electrical
          signals have a different meaning than literal electricity in the
          context of human bodies. I could try to explain it to you, but it's
          better for you to first study the basics. I only know this much thanks
          to the person explaining my condition in detail."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm. You're right. We should be aware of what's going on with our
          bodies as deeply as possible."
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella smiled. "So that's the gist. This can cause irregular
          heartbeats, fatigue, and eventually life-threatening complications
          with elemental disruption."
        </p>
        <p>"This is even worse than before," Evelyn mumbled to herself.</p>
        <p>
          She realized how serious her sister's condition had become. Bella was
          literally hanging between life and death at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's heart sank further with every word. The gravity of the
          situation was finally sinking in, the cold fear of losing her sister
          tightening around her like a vice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What about the cure? What did Teacher say about it?" Evelyn asked,
          addressing the most important issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, they had to cure her sister of this condition before
          anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Teacher did talk to the person about this, and thankfully, there's a
          solution for this too, but…"
        </p>

        <p>
          "But what?" Evelyn asked impatiently. Her sister was making her
          anxious with these pauses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each pause felt like an eternity, each delay another step closer to
          despair.
        </p>
        <p>"The materials required for the cure are not easily found."</p>
        <p>
          "What are these materials? How rare can they be?" Evelyn wondered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There are three things: a Polarium Ore that can absorb excess
          magnetic energy, which would serve to stabilize my internal field.
          Second, a Fluxweave Herb, a plant that grows only in areas with
          fluctuating magnetic fields. It could harmonize the magnetism within
          the body when brewed into a potion."
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella coughed lightly as Evelyn quickly poured some water for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Take it easy and tell me slowly. There's no need to rush," she
          whispered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's fine. The Polarium Ore, although rare, can still be accessed.
          Teacher Alison is already searching for it through her network. The
          plant can be found in the Shifting Iron Plains, so that can still be
          found with some help. But the main issue is the third material…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's expression grew tense as she waited for her sister to finish
          speaking.
        </p>
        <p>"It's the heart of a Null Beast."</p>
        <p>
          "This…?" Evelyn had a perplexed look on her face. She didn't
          understand what her sister was saying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella sighed. "It's a mythical beast with immunity to all forms of
          magnetism."
        </p>
        <p>"A mythical beast!? How are we going to find one?"</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn was stunned, but Bella interrupted her. "Even if we find one by
          some luck, what are the chances we will be able to subdue it and get
          its heart? We're talking about a mythical beast, not a dog!"
        </p>
        <p>"Then what are we going to do!?"</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's voice rose in frustration, her desperation mirroring the
          hopelessness of the situation. Her hands clenched into fists,
          trembling with the weight of the impossible task before them.
