        <h2>Chapter 221 &nbsp;The irony! Bella's hesitation!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 221</p>
        <p>
          "I don't know!" Bella shouted. Her voice cracked, raw with frustration
          and fear. She froze, realizing there was no need to yell at her
          sister, who was only looking out for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm sorry…" She quickly apologized. "I don't know, I—I'm just as
          confused as you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her voice softened, guilt swelling in her chest. She felt guilty for
          yelling at Evelyn, despite the fact that the latter was worried sick
          for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, it's my fault for pressing you so much. I should have known
          better." Evelyn quickly comforted her sister as she pulled her into a
          hug.
        </p>
        <p>
          The warmth of the hug calmed Bella's nerves a little, but the weight
          of her situation remained heavy in the air between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry. Teacher Alison is currently searching for the materials
          on her own. It was also due to this whole situation that she wasn't
          there when you guys were attacked by heretics. In a way, I was also
          responsible for putting your lives in danger… If not for me, Teacher
          would have been there, and you all wouldn't have had to suffer like
          that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No! It has nothing to do with you. Those heretics were planning to
          spread chaos anyway. And I don't think any of us would ever blame you.
          Besides, sister, you probably don't know, but Oliver is really strong.
          He even led us all calmly without flinching in fear. Even I was
          anxious at that time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella's eyes softened as Evelyn spoke. Hearing about Oliver brought a
          faint smile to her lips, easing the tension between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn talked a lot about what had happened back then, and Bella
          smiled as the mood lightened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sister, I think we should tell Mom and Dad about this. They can
          surely help us get the heart of a Null Beast!" Evelyn suggested.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her voice was full of hope, clinging to the belief that their powerful
          family could find a solution.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No." Bella shook her head. "It will be my last resort. I want to
          trust Teacher, and you are not going to talk about it with anyone."
        </p>
        <p>"But sister, why—?"</p>

        <p>
          "Evelyn." Bella firmly called out to her. "I want you to promise me
          this. You are not going to say a single word to Mom or Dad. I trusted
          you and told you everything. Promise me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn hesitated, her chest tightening. Evelyn felt conflicted. She
          couldn't help but feel puzzled, thinking her sister was being
          careless. Their clan surely had better networks and a huge number of
          exorcists. If they wanted to, they could surely find a Null Beast.
        </p>
        <p>
          So why was her sister being like this? Why was she so stubborn? She
          didn't know what to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at her sister's firm expression and desperate eyes, she
          finally said, "Fine, but the moment I feel your condition has worsened
          any further, or if Teacher takes too long, then I will tell the clan
          without even asking you."
        </p>
        <p>"Alright." Bella nodded and gently patted her head.</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn didn't say much afterward, and after spending some time with
          her sister, she, too, returned to her residence. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot
          c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mind was a storm of thoughts as she left, frustration and
          determination swirling together.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sister, don't worry. Even if I can't tell Mom and Dad, I will get
          those materials for you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes were determined. She was prepared to get those materials for
          her sister, even if she had to roam the entire world for them.
        </p>
        <p>But doubt gnawed at her mind.</p>
        <p>"But…"</p>
        <p>
          She couldn't help but bite her lip, a habit she had whenever she was
          frustrated or emotional, as she thought about her own helplessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had the divine light element as her primary element, an element
          also known to be the ultimate cure for any illness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, she was unable to heal her own sister. The irony of her situation
          stung like a wound. This wasn't because the element of light was
          lacking but rather because her control and expertise over the element
          were what truly lacked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had she mastered her element more, maybe she would have been able to
          ease her sister's worries without relying on external materials like
          this.
        </p>

        <p>
          The bitterness of her inadequacy gnawed at her, but she pushed it
          aside, focusing instead on what she could do.
        </p>
        <p>Why was her sister hiding her condition from their parents?</p>
        <p>
          She had a bold guess. Her sister, being the most talented of her
          generation, was someone everyone looked up to. She had to maintain an
          image that represented not only herself but also the entire clan. She
          was burdened by the weight of the expectations that came with being
          one of the main heirs of such a prestigious clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          People even referred to her as "the next clan master," "the future
          clan head," "the most talented," and so on…
        </p>
        <p>
          She was famed for her rare element of magnetism in the clan. It was
          expected of her to prove her mastery and strength over this rare
          element. In the eyes of such people, revealing this condition would be
          admitting to a personal failure, which could jeopardize her position
          as an heir and damage the reputation of their family as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite knowing that the clan would offer help, her sister's pride and
          desire to live up to the clan's high standards drove her to handle the
          situation alone.
        </p>
        <p>Bella was ready to bear it all alone.</p>
        <p>
          Furthermore, there was the underlying fear of disappointing her
          family…
        </p>
        <p>
          As an heir, much was expected of her, and she didn't want to appear
          weak or in need of saving. Her pride was as strong as her element. She
          wanted to prove that she could conquer the challenges tied to her
          unique abilities without relying on the clan's intervention, believing
          that if she solved this problem independently, it would solidify her
          worthiness as an heir.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn personally felt that this wasn't necessary. Was her life more
          important than her reputation as the clan heir? Why did her sister
          care about other people's opinions?
        </p>
        <p>
          Would it diminish her value? No, definitely not. The faster she
          healed, the quicker she could become stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or… maybe it was nothing like that, and her sister simply felt that
          the attention and resources of the clan should remain focused on
          larger, more important concerns, such as dealing with demons?
        </p>
        <p>
          Her condition, though serious, might not seem as pressing compared to
          the threats demons posed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn's thoughts churned, but one thing was clear— her sister
          wouldn't suffer. Not on her watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as she was alive, she would make sure that nothing ever
          happened to the people she cherished.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that moment, unknown to Evelyn, her body was shrouded in a glowing
          white divine light. It was as if the stars were acknowledging the
          resolve she had taken and giving her the power to back up the resolve
          she had made.
        </p>
        <p>____________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 222 &nbsp;The suspicious book?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 222</p>
        <p>"Argh! You bastard, who are you!?"</p>
        <p>
          The woman cursed as she clutched her left arm, or rather, where her
          left arm was supposed to be. All that remained was a bloody stump.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing in front of her was Oliver in clean clothes, his expression
          calm and indifferent,&nbsp;devoid of any blood. It was as if he was an
          untouchable angel that mortals like her could not taint.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his hand was a hydraulic blade that seemed to contain water moving
          at high intensity, its surface shimmering with a deadly gleam.
        </p>
        <p>He looked coldly at the woman and said, "Can't you see?"</p>
        <p>He pointed the blade at her.</p>
        <p>"I am an exorcist."</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, another voice came from the corner of the room. A man
          kneeling and huffing, his forehead bleeding, said,
        </p>
        <p>
          "That white hair… those eyes that seem inhuman and human at the same
          moment… are you… are you… from the…"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mystic Purge Clan. Indeed, I am an heir to the Mystic Purge Clan,"
          Oliver completed the sentence, his voice steady and matter-of-fact.
        </p>

        <p>
          The woman's and man's pupils dilated at that moment. Their suspicions
          were finally confirmed. They already had an inkling of where this
          monstrous child came from, and now their doubts were affirmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          A main heir of the infamous Mystic Purge Clan, the clan known to be
          the bane of all demons!
        </p>
        <p>
          Their luck must be either too good or too bad to encounter such an
          entity in a place like this backwater city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who would have expected that they would be discovered not by any
          ordinary exorcist, but by a main heir to the Mystic Purge Clan!
        </p>
        <p>
          This revelation made their hearts race. This was both a terrible and
          great opportunity for them—terrible because they were on the verge of
          being exorcised by the child before them, and great because they had
          been given the golden opportunity to kill one of the major enemies of
          their masters while he was still growing.
        </p>
        <p>'But that seems impossible…'</p>
        <p>
          The man thought in despair as he saw the espera radiating from the
          boy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The espera was vast, tremendous, far greater than both of their
          esperas combined. The boy was clearly a Rank-2 exorcist, judging by
          the quantity of his espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ashen gray espera leaking from his body filled the entire room
          like a flood, the pressure suffocating the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Desperation clawed at the man's insides. Sweat rolled down his
          forehead as he thought of ways to escape with his partner from this
          predicament.
        </p>
        <p>He knew they didn't have much time, so they had to act quickly.</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a sinister idea struck his mind, and he shouted to the
          woman, "Keep him engaged."
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman, the dark alchemist, was more powerful than him. It was
          ideal for her to stall for some time while he prepared what he had in
          mind.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was sure that if it worked, both of them could escape and might
          even finish off this boy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman, hearing this, immediately stood up. Her dark espera had
          largely stopped the excessive bleeding, and her eyes were filled with
          a cruel gleam as she scowled, "You spawn of those damn exorcists,
          always interfering with our plans. Today is the day you die."
        </p>
        <p>
          A large sword appeared in her hand as she swung it effortlessly,
          showcasing her brute strength despite her slender frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes flickered with suspicion. He knew something was up when
          he saw the man bringing out an old, tattered black book with blood
          engravings on its cover.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had a bad feeling just standing idle; he didn't want to take any
          risks with these heretics and quickly swung his blade forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman instantly closed in on him and blocked his blade with her
          large sword.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't stop and repeatedly attacked, his strength bursting and
          pushing the woman backward with each swing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman made a twisted expression as she shouted back at the man,
          "HOW LONG!?"
        </p>
        <p>"Wait, I'm almost done."</p>
        <p>
          The woman gritted her teeth. Her hands were feeling numb just from
          blocking Oliver's strikes, and she couldn't help but feel astonished
          at how this small boy possessed such disastrous brute strength.
        </p>

        <p>She wouldn't last much longer if this continued.</p>
        <p>She had to do something before that happened.</p>
        <p>
          Seeing that she was still resisting, Oliver turned ferocious. In his
          other hand, a rapier suddenly appeared, and he struck forward.
        </p>
        <p>[Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom]</p>
        <p>"Pfft!"</p>
        <p>
          The woman was sent flying by the unexpected force and coughed up
          blood. Oliver didn't even give her a moment to regain her balance
          before striking at her head and rendering her unconscious with a blow.
        </p>
        <p>He looked at the man, who met his gaze fearfully, and—</p>
        <p>[Six Thoughtful Steps of Spirits]</p>
        <p>
          In a blur of motion, Oliver appeared beneath the man and punched him
          in the gut, knocking the air out of his lungs.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cough!" The man's eyes turned white, and his eyeballs rolled back as
          he ultimately lost consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver paused and made a phone call to the local police station, or
          more specifically, to the chief, as his call was directly answered by
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gave a few instructions and asked him to reach a certain location
          after cleaning up the playground. The location was the underground
          basement; he had already taken care of everything, and the other minor
          stuff would be handled by them. He also asked them to contact the
          nearest Exorcist Union branch and have them dispatch exorcists to
          investigate properly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would clean up the main items that might come in handy or could
          sell for a lot, while the rest of the cleanup would be handled by
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before that, however, he had to do one thing. His eyes narrowed in
          thought. He glanced down at the unconscious man, and his eyes changed.
          Using his special eyes, he observed the man for a little while before
          returning to normal.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He can still be exorcised and saved," he declared to himself and
          placed a hand on the man's forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dark, disgusting black espera started to leak out of the man's head
          and collected in Oliver's palm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver remained in that position for the next few minutes, and only
          after no more dark espera came out of the man's body did he remove his
          hand. The dark espera gathered into a black ball in his hands. He
          clenched his hands into a fist, and all the black espera scattered.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man's unconscious expression gradually turned more relaxed, and
          his pale skin seemed to regain a healthy color instantly.
        </p>

        <p>
          What Oliver did was simply perform a brute exorcism without any basic
          technique, just dragging out the dark espera from the man and
          purifying it.&nbsp;It was a straightforward, raw process—effective but
          lacking the finesse of more refined techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was able to do so only because the man had not been completely
          corrupted by the dark espera. A full transformation into a heretic
          hadn't taken place yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, while there were many heretics here and there, a majority of
          them weren't as corrupted or brainwashed by demons as some of the
          extreme ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jetia and his comrades were examples of heretics who had completely
          submitted to demons and could not be saved anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          This man, however, was different. The dark espera hadn't taken over
          the man's mind and soul yet. It was possible that the woman, the dark
          alchemist, had tainted and brainwashed this man, turning him into a
          heretic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to [Cosmic Void Gaze], he caught a glimpse of the level of
          corruption inside the man's body and felt it was not at a level where
          he could be forsaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, this one could be saved. The woman had a deeper level of
          corruption; however, it wasn't that deeply intertwined yet. Her
          situation would need a more careful approach. He didn't exorcise her
          due to its complexity. A proper exorcist with standard techniques
          could help her out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once they woke up, they shouldn't remember much of their time as
          heretics, in the worst case. But it was fine; there were all sorts of
          treatment and aftercare available.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was better to leave the details to those more specialized in
          rehabilitative exorcism. Now that the exorcists had been contacted, it
          was not ideal for him to stay any longer.
        </p>
        <p>"Sigh..."</p>

        <p>
          The clan would know by now where he was. The network and influence the
          clan had on the Exorcist Union were just too strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered if he should use the black hair dye he had in his storage
          artifact to change his features… he hadn't used it so far since he
          liked his silky white hair a lot. It was part of his identity,
          something familiar in a world full of uncertainty. Almost elf-like…
        </p>
        <p>
          If he didn't hurry up, he would be caught before he had the chance to
          explore further.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the mission given by the Black Codex Federation? The chimera's
          body should serve as enough proof to justify it. Not to mention, he
          had also taken some pictures in advance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although all of this was definitely unnecessary, evidence like this
          could easily be faked, and such a huge hidden organization had its own
          ways of finding out whether the mission was completed or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          They probably wouldn't even need the little proof he had recorded.
        </p>
        <p>"Now then, let's quickly go through what we have here..."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't waste time and started collecting whatever he felt was
          worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were some jewels, containers of beast blood, and some special
          array ink.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stored all of it in his storage artifact. Only the most important
          things were stored in his mindspace; the rest belonged to his
          bracelet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything was organized, methodical. "Hmm, let me get this off of
          you…" He walked up to the woman and swiftly removed the storage ring
          on her index finger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ring was without any locks, unlike the storage artifact of the
          demonic ghost, so he easily accessed the contents of the storage ring.
        </p>
        <p>"Woah… that's something."</p>

        <p>
          He was immediately met with the stunning sight of multiple thick,
          dark-covered books with various information on them.
        </p>
        <p>"These are books on dark alchemy!" n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om</p>
        <p>
          His heart skipped a beat. His eyes started to shine as he looked at
          the content of the books—it was a fortune.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although dark alchemy was a forbidden concept to the world, it was not
          a harm to learn about such things beforehand because it might come in
          handy in dire situations in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, dark alchemy was inherently derived from alchemy
          itself, so most of the concepts held similar meanings as well. It
          would not be a problem for him to delve into the concepts now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Forbidden knowledge had its allure, especially in a world where
          survival often meant understanding every threat. "Hmm, a decent find."
          There were some thick bundles of cash, a weird-looking black pendant,
          and some other materials in the ring apart from the books.
        </p>
        <p>"Now then, what is this?"</p>
        <p>
          He glanced at the ominous book lying on the floor—it was the same book
          the man was tinkering with earlier. From his confidence, he seemed
          sure that it would be able to harm him despite the difference in their
          strengths.
        </p>
        <p>
          He couldn't help but be curious about it at the same time. The book
          was indeed very ominous and gave him a sinking feeling, even just
          lying idly on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>"Should I leave this book for others to handle?"</p>
        <p>
          He pondered; it was indeed very risky to touch this obvious red flag
          of a book. His intuition and experience of reading countless novels
          told him that touching the book would not be any good for him.
        </p>
        <p>'But…'</p>

        <p>
          It was often at times like this that the protagonist who gets into
          such situations becomes even stronger… with great danger comes great
          opportunities, too.
        </p>
        <p>
          This could be one of those moments. He didn't know whether to take the
          risk by opening that unknown heretical book or just be on his way to
          stay far from his clan.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah, damn it."</p>
        <p>In the end, he made up his mind and moved closer to the book.</p>
        <p>
          Deploying and reinforcing himself with espera, he double-checked his
          defenses. Even if something breached them, there was abyss energy
          guarding him at the deepest levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being the Circuit of Abyss, he could never run out of abyss energy no
          matter what. His reserves might become low at times, but they would
          never be completely depleted.
        </p>
        <p>He had made up his mind.</p>
        <p>
          His hand touched the book as a prickling sensation spread through his
          palm. He didn't waver and slowly, steadily opened the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The page he viewed had a large black square—it was dark, as if painted
          by the world's darkest blackest of paints.
        </p>
        <p>Not a single ray of light was reflected from it.</p>
        <p>
          He flipped the page, and the following pages had the same figure of
          the dark square. However, he noticed that each page seemed to have a
          square larger than its predecessor.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he flipped through the pages, the square became bigger and bigger,
          seeming to cover the entire page. The sensation in his palms grew more
          vivid as he reached the book's end.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the final page, and when he flipped it, all he saw was a black
          page, completely void of white. It was dark and blank.

        <h2>Chapter 224 &nbsp;Ophelia summons the elder!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 224</p>
        <p>
          It was the final page, and the moment he flipped it, all he saw was a
          black page, completely void of white. It was dark and blank.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sensations in his hand reached an extreme as he felt a strong
          pulling force from the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tried to suppress the book with his abundant espera; however, it
          seemed to have absolutely no effect on it. The force ignored his
          efforts as if his energy was nothing.
        </p>
        <p>The force intensified until he was no longer able to pull back.</p>
        <p>
          'This... can't be good,' he thought, watching helplessly as his hand
          started to sink into the book—the page seemed to be pulling him in.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tide of an unknown force, neither espera nor dark espera, washed
          over him as his body was forcefully pulled into the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this moment, Oliver's expression was calm. He knew panicking would
          not solve anything, and since he had decided to take the risk, he was
          going to follow through to the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world around him seemed to warp, twisting as though reality itself
          was being rewritten. The book expanded and expanded until it turned
          into a pitch-black square that seemed to distort space itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver disappeared from the scene, from the underground basement, as
          if he had never existed in the place, along with the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver opened his eyes as he felt himself falling into a pitch-black
          pit with no sky or ground; he seemed to be falling endlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;The sensation was both familiar and foreign, like tumbling
          through a dream he couldn't wake from.
        </p>
        <p>
          His expression was chillingly calm as he traced the outline of his
          fingers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next instant, his eyes changed colors, like brilliantly shining
          suns. His sight pierced the never-ending darkness.
        </p>

        <p>It was a scene that could send chills to any spectator…</p>
        <p>
          A figure falling into the endless darkness, nothing visible—not even
          the figure itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a pair of eyes remained untainted by the darkness. Eyes that
          seemed to devour the very void around them. It was as if nothing in
          the world could obstruct those eyes as they stared up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those eyes seemed all-knowing, nothing in the world could be hidden
          from them… be it abyss, be it the boundless heavens…
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything revealed its deepest secrets before the gaze of the endless
          cosmos.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Fascinating...' Oliver thought, his mind racing through the
          possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world before Oliver was no longer a blanket of darkness; he could
          see everything. It was like watching a curtain pull back, revealing
          the intricate workings of an unseen machine. If asked what was
          happening, he would immediately answer that he was traveling through
          space.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was falling, or perhaps more accurately, traveling through a space
          tunnel to a place far from the underground basement.
        </p>
        <p>'So they intended for me to be transported somewhere else?'</p>
        <p>
          Was it a trap? A portal to another dimension? He didn't know, but the
          excitement outweighed the uncertainty. He wondered if that's what the
          man was thinking. But what was at the end of this space tunnel?
        </p>
        <p>
          He doubted even the man knew; after all, he had not allowed them to
          complete it before subduing them.
        </p>
        <p>He wondered where he would end up.</p>
        <p>
          His heart throbbed with excitement rather than fear—all he felt was
          endless anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small smile tugged at the corners of his lips. He popped his fingers
          as he kept falling deeper and deeper into the tunnel, ready to act in
          any situation thrown at him.
        </p>
        <p>____________________</p>

        <p>Mystic Purge Clan</p>
        <p>
          At the grand courtyard where the mistress of the clan resided, all was
          as calm and silent as ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia sat with her eyes closed as if in a meditative state. The sky
          above her was clear and devoid of clouds, a bizarre but acceptable
          sight for someone of her level.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sudden gust of wind blew as the trees shivered against the
          unexpected winds. The unnatural shift in the air sent a subtle tension
          across the courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>She opened her eyes at that moment and calmly looked up.</p>
        <p>"His fate has changed drastically again. What happened?"</p>
        <p>
          She spoke in a tone neither low nor high, as if making a judgment. Her
          voice, though steady, carried a weight that made the very air around
          her tremble.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew what it meant. Just recently, she had altered the paths in
          his fate to match what she wanted them to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          But not even a few days had passed since then, and Oliver's fate was
          once again back to how it originally was. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          An utterly chaotic and messy cluster of countless paths, with no
          definite beginning or end, almost as if…
        </p>
        <p>
          As if… the world could no longer determine a general direction for his
          fate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes flickered as she wondered what had caused this to happen.
          Such unpredictability was rare, even for someone like her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't think anything significant had happened in the past few
          days…
        </p>
        <p>Or… had something happened?</p>
        <p>
          She had been in her courtyard, and unless a matter was of utmost
          importance, no one was allowed to enter.
        </p>

        <p>
          A bell suddenly appeared in her hand. She rang it twice, producing an
          extremely gentle and melodious tone.
        </p>
        <p>Tinkle! Tinkle!</p>
        <p>
          Two soft high pitched sounds were produced. The sound resonated, as if
          it was echoing through dimensions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bell disappeared, and a few moments later, a visitor appeared in
          her courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>"Madam Ophelia, how may I be of service?"</p>
        <p>
          It was an old man with robust features, dressed in blue robes bearing
          the symbol of the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>Ophelia's serene gaze fell on the old man.</p>
        <p>
          He was an elder responsible for serving her and keeping her informed
          about clan affairs when she asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          If one paid close attention to his voice, they would recognize him as
          the same elder who was present when Oliver was born.
        </p>
        <p>He held a very high position in the clan as an elder.</p>
        <p>
          She never bothered to know his name or identity. In her eyes, only
          their utility mattered. In front of her, all positions or names were
          meaningless. Was there anyone with a higher prestige than her in the
          entire clan?
        </p>
        <p>
          To her, this old man was equivalent to just another of her countless
          servants.
        </p>
        <p>"Tell me about the situation outside."</p>
        <p>Her cold words echoed heavily in the eerily quiet atmosphere.</p>
        <p>
          The elder's heart shook for a moment before he calmed down. Even after
          countless meetings, he could not fully relax in Ophelia's presence.
          She was too formidable and full of prestige.
        </p>
        <p>Each day, she seemed to grow even more terrifying.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, madam. Recently, the demons from the eastern borders have
          appointed a new general—"
        </p>
        <p>"Stop."</p>
        <p>
          The elder was instantly silenced. Ophelia had ordered him to stop
          speaking, and he did so. He was only there to obey, not to question.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What has happened with Oliver?" she asked, simple and
          straightforward.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes narrowed slightly, signaling this was the only question that
          truly mattered.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 225 - The World of Demons!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 225</p>
        <p>
          "Pardon? Oliver…?" The elder was momentarily stunned; this was really
          out of the blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, Young Master Oliver…" Feeling a little flustered, the elder
          quickly composed himself. He had never expected Ophelia to care about
          her children in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, except for Nadia. So he couldn't help but feel surprised when he
          found her interested in Oliver's affairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, she would have a report prepared on Nadia's daily routine and
          activities delivered to her every week, often detailing what Nadia had
          been or would be doing for the week.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as for Oliver, she never showed any peculiar interest. Until
          recently, he was considered a talentless seedling, but then he
          suddenly bloomed with talent and secured a position in the clan's
          event.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been there when Oliver was born, but he never sensed a single
          talent in the boy at that time. Back then, the boy had seemed
          ordinary, unremarkable.
        </p>
        <p>Perhaps this was why Ophelia was now showing interest in her son.</p>
        <p>
          The elder's thoughts ran quickly as he considered all of this in
          seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Regarding the young master, I don't have particularly detailed
          information about his activities, but I will have it prepared
          immediately. As for anything major recently concerning the young
          master, I heard from the other elders that he took on a mission from
          the clan's administrative center in disguise and left discreetly for
          the mission. The elder in charge has already dispatched a group of
          professionals from the clan to bring him back. It should not be long
          before he returns…"
        </p>
        <p>
          He suddenly quieted down as he felt the air around him grow heavier
          with each passing moment, as if a huge boulder was pressing down on
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at Ophelia's expression, which hadn't changed a bit since
          the beginning. But for some reason, he felt a strong sense of
          gloominess radiating from her calm face.
        </p>

        <p>Was she perhaps angry?</p>
        <p>
          Was she angry? Had he misspoken? The elder shivered slightly; he
          didn't dare imagine the consequences if her wrath exploded.
        </p>
        <p>The calmer the person, the greater the wrath.</p>
        <p>
          Seeing Ophelia's expression as if she didn't want to see his face
          anymore, he quickly took his leave.
        </p>
        <p>"So, he escaped from the clan in the end."</p>
        <p>
          Ophelia spoke to herself. She seemed to have expected this outcome to
          some extent.
        </p>
        <p>"I thought I tied his fate down, but..."</p>
        <p>
          "For his fate to shift so much from this, it looks like he won't be
          returning anytime soon. Interesting…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia lightly tapped her finger against the wooden table as she
          seemed to contemplate something.
        </p>
        <p>Her gaze flickered ominously as she stood alone in her courtyard.</p>
        <p>____________________</p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          A black, square-shaped portal emerged out of nowhere, and a boy with
          shimmering white hair jumped from it, landing perfectly on the
          irregular ground below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Instantly, his senses expanded, covering everything around him, his
          eyes gazing and scanning his surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sky was covered with thick, dark yellow clouds, looking as though
          they were made of sulfur, blocking the warm sunlight from the world
          below.
        </p>
        <p>"This familiar setting… this place is…"</p>
        <p>"The demon world!"</p>
        <p>
          His pupils shrank as his senses sharpened, putting him on high alert.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly assessed his surroundings and realized he was in a narrow
          alleyway, with strange buildings on both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          He leaped, his figure blurring under the pale yellow light from the
          clouds. He wore the [Cloak of Darkness] and used Abyss energy to
          completely conceal any trace of espera within him. His presence was
          nearly non-existent at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unless he walked up to someone, no one would be able to notice him.
          The energy surrounding him was perfect camouflage.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the support of rugged surfaces, he soon reached the top of the
          building beside him. His gaze was distant as he involuntarily let out
          a remark.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh man… this is going to be troublesome."</p>
        <p>In front of him, as far as he could see, was a vast spectacle.</p>
        <p>
          The place was built in the shadow of a rugged volcano, a truly
          historic metropolis. It was a large city, filled with towering black
          buildings of all kinds…
        </p>
        <p>
          Its elegance was matched by the backdrop of dark mountains, which had
          helped shape the city into what it was today at a glance.
        </p>

        <p>
          The climate brought by these mountains was of great importance, but
          they were also influential in architectural designs, as the majority
          of buildings were shaped to complement the dark volcanic mountains
          behind them, giving an ominous view.
        </p>
        <p>
          The skyline was riddled with elaborate skyscrapers, many of which
          showed their age and rich history. Various cultures seemed to have
          left their mark not only on the city's history but also on its
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          What historically was a city of few differences had grown into a large
          melting pot, and it was this that united the 8 million residents to
          this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hundreds of bakeries, bars, and ethnic restaurants—it almost resembled
          a normal human city in an eerie way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond the city, there was barren, empty, and harsh land—not an ideal
          place for life. It was a twisted reflection of the human world, just
          more brutal.
        </p>
        <p>It was definitely a place where demons would live.</p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          Hot air blew against his face, and memories from the novel about
          demons and their world flooded his mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt no regret; he had already decided to face whatever was coming
          when he picked up the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          He just felt it was going to be a long journey before he could return.
          From the looks of it, he was in some random demon city. Crossing
          borders and entering the human world would be very difficult from this
          point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he still had to do it. There was no turning back now. He
          could only imagine what the clan was doing at the moment upon finding
          out he was not where he was supposed to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          He heard some noises and looked down. In the streets below, he saw
          multiple demons walking around normally. Nôv(el)B\\jnn

        <h2>Chapter 226 &nbsp;Which path to take?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 226</p>
        <p>
          Demons had both intelligent and unintelligent species. These cities,
          and the majority of the demon world, were controlled and built by the
          intelligent species.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their unintelligent counterparts were used by the intelligent ones to
          attack humans, do heavy labor, or perform any other tasks as desired.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a grim system, where the strong preyed on the weak, both among
          humans and demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was often rumored that the demons who initially invaded the human
          world lacked intellect and were terrifying monsters; the intelligent
          species evolved from them after consuming countless human lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          He closely observed the demons with interest. All of them had vastly
          different appearances and movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were humanoid-looking demons that resembled humans closely, but
          with horns on their heads…
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there were creatures with giant skeletal frames, almost ten feet
          tall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The skeletal demons lumbered through the streets, slow but unyielding,
          their hollow eyes reflecting nothing but the labor they were condemned
          to. Some skeletons walked with hunched backs, mostly used as labor.
        </p>
        <p>
          'This place is stranger than I thought.' Oliver mused as he took in
          the scene.
        </p>
        <p>'Well, what should I do?'</p>
        <p>
          He looked ahead blankly. His main goal was to escape and return to the
          human world. No matter what, this was still demon territory. As a
          Rank-1 exorcist, no matter how well he hid, once he revealed himself
          to someone dangerous, he would be devoured instantly.
        </p>

        <p>'Devoured… or worse.'</p>
        <p>'Hmm, Rank-1 exorcist… should I attempt a breakthrough now?'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes gleamed beneath the dark yellow sky, giving him an
          intimidating look.
        </p>
        <p>
          He already had more than enough espera to attempt becoming a Rank-2
          exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          To increase his chances of survival in this place, he needed to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, he only had a large amount of espera. By breaking through
          to Rank-2, all his physical attributes would receive a boost,
          including his strength.
        </p>
        <p>It would help him one way or another.</p>
        <p>
          'But even with a breakthrough, I'll need to be careful. This is demon
          territory—no place for reckless mistakes.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He needed a more isolated place for the breakthrough. The alleyway was
          decent, but not secure enough, as a passing demon could spot him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, he might have to use his Abyss energy to suppress the outburst
          of his pure espera. The atmosphere was filled with dark espera, and
          the demons would definitely be sensitive if someone with pure espera
          attempted a breakthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had already obtained terrifying talent and had gathered enough
          espera since he last changed his target.
        </p>
        <p>The choice was clear.</p>
        <p>
          He moved like a shadow, leaping from one building to another, his
          movements swift as he searched for a more secluded spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, he found an abandoned temple at the edge of the city. The
          city was enormous, but fortunately, he had been transported near the
          corner, making it easier to reach.
        </p>

        <p>
          The temple was in disrepair, with bricks and rocks scattered across
          the ground. The dusty interior was proof that no one had visited for a
          long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The temple windows were broken, allowing the yellow light from the
          sulfuric clouds to filter through the frames, casting a dark yet
          mysterious vibe inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quiet, far too quiet for comfort. Oliver could feel the thrill
          in his nerves. Although it was eerie, it also carried a unique beauty
          and elegance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perfect. He raised his hand above his head, and instantly, a
          reddish-black dome-shaped energy field appeared around him, isolating
          him from the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to use his lower reserves of Abyss energy to hide the coming
          outburst of espera during his breakthrough to Rank-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even Ophelia had difficulty seeing through his espera when he used
          Abyss energy to cover it. He knew that piercing through Abyss energy
          was impossible. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          The Abyss was infinitely deep, so it made sense that no one could
          penetrate it.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I'll need more Abyss energy soon… not just for this but for what's
          coming.'
        </p>
        <p>'I'll soon need to replenish my Abyss energy…'</p>
        <p>
          He focused his mind and sat in a meditative pose on the temple floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          The espera in his body began to churn gently as he guided it with
          precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, there were two major categories that defined exorcists:
          Physical and Spiritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was previously known to have taken the path of physical
          exorcism.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a reason for the distinction. Exorcists of each path had
          different powers and training styles.
        </p>

        <p>
          To become a spiritual exorcist, one had to undergo something called
          "Core Formation."
        </p>
        <p>
          At each rank, the exorcist forms a more advanced Espera Core, starting
          as a small, unstable core that gradually becomes larger, more refined,
          and efficient. The nature of the core changes with each breakthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Rank-1 to Rank-7, each rank involved core transformations. In the
          beginning, one would form a basic, unstable core prone to
          fluctuations.
        </p>
        <p>
          As rank progression occurred, the core would stabilize and densify,
          allowing greater energy absorption and usage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eventually, as the core condensed into a highly dense state, it would
          begin to affect the exorcist's body, significantly enhancing physical
          capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          All spiritual exorcists aimed to achieve the final transformation into
          a perfect core.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, physical exorcists took a different approach.</p>
        <p>
          To become a physical exorcist, one had to undergo "Body
          Transformation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of focusing on core formation, each breakthrough infused
          espera into the body, transforming the physical form to better handle
          the energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the initial ranks, like Rank-1 or Rank-2, simple Espera Channels
          formed throughout the body to circulate energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As an exorcist reached higher ranks, the channels would thicken and
          merge with muscles and bones, leading to faster reaction times,
          strength, and durability, typically around Rank-3 or Rank-4.
        </p>
        <p>
          But it didn't stop there. In the advanced ranks, espera would seep
          into the cells, providing extreme resilience and allowing esperic
          regeneration of body tissues.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each physical exorcist aimed to achieve full espera transformation,
          turning their bodies into perfect vessels for espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Generally, the physical path was easier for beginners, requiring only
          bodily training to grow stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Spiritual exorcism, however, demanded mental fortitude, exceptional
          control over core formation, and a terrifying willpower to persist.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why there were more physical exorcists than spiritual ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a common belief that spiritual exorcists were the "true
          exorcists," more "noble," or simply stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          A belief that persisted through generations, no matter how often it
          was proven wrong.
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 227 &nbsp;Rank-2 Exorcist! Espera Veins!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 227</p>
        <p>
          But that wasn't true. History had repeatedly shown that true talent
          shone in any path. What mattered was not the path chosen but how one
          treaded upon it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just because someone had the potential to be a spiritual exorcist, if
          they lacked the willpower to persist and grow strong, they would get
          nowhere.
        </p>
        <p>Having talent and using it were two different things.</p>
        <p>
          Now, Oliver possessed great espera talent. Nadia was born with high
          spiritual exorcist potential, so naturally, Oliver had obtained even
          greater talent.
        </p>
        <p>But a single path?</p>
        <p>
          "Why settle for one when I can pursue both?" he mused, a flicker of
          ambition lighting his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he were to describe his current situation, he was more suited to
          the spiritual path than the physical.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, he wouldn't let that limit him. Why choose when he could master
          both?
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled knowingly. With the knowledge from the novel, he knew it was
          possible to walk both paths simultaneously.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was known to a few that one could be both a physical and spiritual
          exorcist. Although not a grand secret to the clans, it wasn't easy to
          achieve.
        </p>

        <p>
          Only those with ample time and effort attempted it. It was extremely
          demanding and time-consuming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most exorcists couldn't afford such a luxury. They had to
          choose—quickly—and dedicate themselves fully to a single path.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Union heavily promoted single-path specialization, discouraging
          dual-path training.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humanity was constantly at war with demons, and the more exorcists
          they could prepare, the better. If everyone tried to walk both paths,
          it would greatly impact battlefield readiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          A pragmatic choice, Oliver knew, but not one that suited his plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone wanted to be strong, especially exorcists, who had their own
          reasons to be the best among their peers. Being both a physical and
          spiritual exorcist would undoubtedly give them an edge, if they had
          the means and knowledge.

        <p>
          To prevent greed from taking over, the Union popularized proper paths
          and exorcism techniques for both categories of exorcism. This was not
          entirely done to recruit more exorcists, but also because novices
          lacked knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Union had countless expert exorcists with vast experience, so it
          was better to prevent novices from wasting their time from the outset
          and save their efforts to focus on one path.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the novel, Nadia, with her talent and hard work, became both a
          physical and spiritual exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, Oliver, with tenfold her talent, would breeze through it. There
          was no need for him to hold back; what applied to ordinary folk didn't
          apply to him.
        </p>
        <p>"I should start now."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver glanced at the broken windows and stared at the clouds, filled
          with dense golden-brown clouds trapping sunlight. He knew he had to
          hurry up.
        </p>

        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          The espera in his body gathered at his solar plexus and started to
          take the shape of a sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he began to form the sphere, fluctuations started to appear around
          him. The pure espera circulated around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fluctuations were so strong that if not for the Abyssal dome,
          demons in the city would have noticed him instantly. It was
          understandable since his espera was already huge even before the
          breakthrough, and after this, it would grow even more.
        </p>
        <p>It was hard to conceal it normally.</p>
        <p>
          The pressure was immense, but Oliver welcomed it. Power thrummed
          through his veins, eager to be unleashed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time passed, a small sphere of bright pure espera formed at his
          solar plexus. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>Usually, this indicated a successful breakthrough.</p>
        <p>Oliver had done it and was now technically a Rank-2 exorcist.</p>
        <p>
          His body felt lighter, his senses sharper. But something was
          different—this wasn't just a breakthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          Things should have stopped there, but they didn't for him. The sphere
          of espera started to spin as he kept his eyes closed and mind focused,
          not minding his surroundings. He was fully immersed in the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thin strands of espera, in the form of threads, began emerging from
          the sphere of espera, increasing in number as seconds passed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Countless threads of pure espera extended from the spherical core. He
          focused, willing control over the countless threads.
        </p>
        <p>
          The threads stirred and started to move, each going in a different
          direction, slowly filling his veins and covering every inch of his
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          His veins intertwined with those threads of espera, creating espera
          channels in his body using the threads as a medium.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process was long and painstaking; sometimes he lost control of a
          thread or two, which would strike a wrong muscle or organ, causing him
          pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hours went by as Oliver remained focused and didn't move from his
          meditative posture.
        </p>
        <p>
          His luck was great as no trouble arose, and the entire process
          remained smooth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, after what seemed like half a day, he opened his eyes, and a
          misty breath escaped his lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          His skin had a certain glow that wasn't there before, his hair seemed
          brighter, and his features appeared more defined.
        </p>
        <p>"I did it."</p>
        <p>
          He stood up, dusting his clothes slightly, as he examined his body. He
          had broken through to Rank-2 and could feel a turbulent power flowing
          inside him.
        </p>
        <p>It surged through his veins, alive, waiting to be tested.</p>
        <p>
          If he were to face that chimera again now, he could have easily
          suppressed it with techniques alone, without even using his water
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked down at his hand and clenched it, feeling a certain energy.
          He had successfully created the espera channels as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          One had to know that for first-timers on the path of physical
          exorcism, forming espera channels required guidance from seniors in
          the field. Creating espera channels was an extremely important
          process, as it laid the foundation for a physical exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          If even one of the countless channels was mishandled by mistake, not
          only would the exorcist's life be in danger, but there was also a
          chance of future outbursts, essentially damaging the exorcist's
          potential.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, this was the very foundation of an exorcist's life. It had
          to be done with extreme care.
        </p>
        <p>So, did Oliver act carelessly because he didn't have time?</p>
        <p>The answer was no.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 228 &nbsp;Inquisitor!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 228</p>
        <p>
          And that's because Oliver was the [Circuit of Abyss], which meant he
          already had extremely well-defined abyssal channels in his body, like
          a complex and intricate circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the paths in his body were already mapped out like a blueprint,
          refined by the abyss, ready to be traced. So, all he had to do to
          create the espera channels was to follow those abyssal channels in his
          body and create adjacent espera channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          This way, he was able to perfectly lay down the foundation of his
          espera channel and begin the path of a physical exorcist with a strong
          base.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the most experienced elders would have found it difficult to
          achieve such perfection in channel formation. After all, seniors could
          only assist externally; ultimately, a person had to be familiar with
          their own body internally.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was also the reason why he was confident in attempting to create
          espera channels on his own without anyone's help.
        </p>
        <p>
          His body was now overflowing with excess espera and energy. It felt as
          if he could blast through any wall in front of him with a punch.
        </p>
        <p>
          His core was floating at his solar plexus, and his body was covered in
          espera channels. This mystical and perfect foundation wasn't just
          rare—it was unheard of.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could now be said to have become a perfect vessel for an exorcist!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver couldn't help but smile slightly as he looked at the red dome
          of energy isolating and concealing his existence. He thought about
          dispelling it now that he had already achieved his breakthrough.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before he could do so, his ears picked up a tapping sound from the
          temple's entrance. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>

        <p>
          The tapping was faint but deliberate, too methodical to be a random
          visitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          His senses had significantly enhanced by now, and his hearing had
          improved tremendously. He instantly detected the faint but rhythmic
          sound of someone's footsteps drawing close to the abandoned temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I couldn't have been discovered. Did this person come to visit this
          abandoned temple, then?'
        </p>
        <p>
          He had great trust in Abyss energy and knew there was no way he had
          been found, so the most likely reason behind the unexpected sound of
          footsteps was that someone had come to the temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so, something about the presence unnerved him—a quiet, lingering
          menace that accompanied those footsteps.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't dispel the Abyssal dome and waited quietly. He couldn't
          sense the espera of the other party at all, so it was obvious that
          whoever was approaching was stronger than him, even though he was now
          a Rank-2 exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since he had already spent so much time hidden in the dome, he didn't
          mind waiting a bit longer until the person or demon who had come to
          the temple left.
        </p>
        <p>
          He observed the intruder and narrowed his eyes instantly when he
          noticed the demon.
        </p>
        <p>It was obviously a demon.</p>
        <p>'A woman…?'</p>
        <p>
          He observed her features calmly. She had a human-like build, but her
          hair was dark, and two long purple-colored horns were on either side
          of her forehead, matching the color of her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>She was dressed in a black military coat of sorts…</p>

        <p>'Not just any coat… this is…'</p>
        <p>
          'That's undoubtedly the uniform of demonic security forces, but it's
          different somehow… hmm, is she someone working in internal affairs?
          Wait, an inquisitor perhaps!'
        </p>
        <p>The blood drained from Oliver's face as realization hit him.</p>
        <p>'Oh, fuck, what's an inquisitor doing here?'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver couldn't help but feel a trace of cold sweat on his neck as he
          recognized the uniform. It belonged to the Inquisitors of the demon
          army.
        </p>
        <p>Inquisitors.</p>
        <p>
          They were the shadow of the demon lords, the enforcers of unbending
          law.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inquisitors were a specialized faction within the demon world, tasked
          with enforcing absolute loyalty and rooting out traitors, dissidents,
          and humans who pose a threat to demon rule.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inquisitors were one of the most feared groups in the demon world due
          to their brutal interrogation and torture methods, which have become
          legendary even among demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were known for their ruthless efficiency, keen intelligence, and
          use of fear as a weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          If a demon feared another demon, it was usually because of the
          Inquisitors.
        </p>
        <p>In essence,</p>

        <p>
          Inquisitors ensure strict obedience to demon laws and the will of
          powerful demon lords. They oversee investigations, trials, and
          executions, often acting as judge, jury, and executioner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their primary mission is to identify and eradicate any potential
          rebellion or resistance, whether from within demon society or from
          hidden human insurgents.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, they specialize in gathering intelligence, extracting
          confessions, and deciphering codes. Their knowledge of both demon and
          human psychology allows them to anticipate rebellions before they
          begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, just as humans had heretics who worshipped demons within
          their lands, demons also had their own "heretics" who collaborated
          with humans for various benefits. There were multiple hidden human
          establishments in demon territories, organized by the Exorcist Union
          to weaken them from within.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the biggest obstacles for Oliver to escape from demon lands was
          undoubtedly these Inquisitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could sniff out a human in demon territory as easily as a wolf
          finds prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the novel, he knew that only demons with twisted morality were
          ever selected for the role of an Inquisitor. They believed they were
          enacting the ultimate justice of the demon lords and saw torture and
          punishment as righteous acts.
        </p>
        <p>Completely different from human standards, naturally.</p>
        <p>
          'They played a vital role in the Blood War too… that uniform itself is
          a symbol of fear,' he thought as he took a deep breath and carefully
          reinforced the Abyssal barrier for added security.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demonic woman was quite tall, taller than the average human. Her
          expression was stoic, and her hair swayed behind her with each step
          she took.
        </p>
        <p>Her way of walking showed discipline.</p>
        <p>She came closer to him as Oliver subconsciously held his breath.</p>
        <p>Every nerve in his body screamed at him to stay absolutely still.</p>
        <p>The demonic woman gave him a strong sense of unease.</p>
        <p>
          She approached the Abyssal dome, and Oliver stood still, not even
          moving an inch, holding his breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that even with the Abyssal dome, if he made any movements,
          someone strong could still find it suspicious. And that woman was
          definitely strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demonic lady was now extremely close to the Abyssal dome. She
          paused and looked to her side, and his eyes met her face as she seemed
          to stare directly at him for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>Her eyes narrowed dangerously&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Chapter 229 - A coincidence or not?</h2>

        <p>Chapter 229</p>
        <p>She passed by the Abyssal dome.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver heaved a sigh of relief as he watched the woman approach a
          broken statue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The statue depicted a foul-looking demon of fury and dread, its two
          raging eyes staring at him with a wicked fury. It had a broad mouth
          with spiky protrusions inside. The craftsmanship was incredibly
          lifelike, as if the sculptor were a master with centuries of
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          Scars and cracks covered nearly every inch of it now, disfiguring the
          already grotesque features. He had no desire to find out what kind of
          violent history had led to its current state.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver wondered who this demon was. It was most likely dead by now,
          but he couldn't help feeling intimidated just by its statue—and
          imagining how it had died.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whoever or whatever had the power to defeat such a creature must have
          been terrifying beyond measure.
        </p>
        <p>
          He watched as the demon inquisitor reached the statue and stared at it
          for some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          She extended her hand, tracing her fingers along the dusty exterior of
          the broken statue, her touch lingering on one of the more heinous
          scars on the statue's chest.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver noticed her long nails painted with purple polish as she
          remained engrossed in the statue.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, she spoke, her voice as sweet as honey. "You've been quite
          the nuisance, you know?"
        </p>
        <p>Oliver's breath caught as he instinctively tensed his muscles.</p>
        <p>How? When?</p>
        <p>When did she find out?</p>
        <p>
          She didn't turn around, and her back remained facing Oliver, who was
          frozen in place.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had already prepared his strongest counter, ready to escape if
          necessary.
        </p>
        <p>The woman spoke again. "Isn't that right, uncle?"</p>
        <p>
          She stared at the statue, locking eyes with it as if talking to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          'What is this?' Oliver's mind raced. 'Is she talking to the statue?
          Or… me?'
        </p>
        <p>
          He couldn't shake the feeling that this might be some kind of trick.
          Was she baiting him, waiting for him to reveal his location by
          reacting? Or was she truly lost in her own thoughts?'
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind raced with possibilities. There was a chance the inquisitor
          already knew about him but, upon realizing he was about to counter and
          escape, decided to pretend she was talking to the statue.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was also the possibility that she was reliving a memory from
          when the demon depicted by the statue was still alive. They probably
          had some sort of connection.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You used to be revered by the masses for your might, yet in the end,
          you died so miserably at the hands of the Witch of Death…" she
          whispered quietly, but in the silent surroundings, her voice was heard
          clearly.
        </p>
        <p>That name again.</p>

        <p>'Ophelia,' Oliver thought, blinking. Of course, it had to be her.</p>
        <p>
          'Umm…' Oliver was speechless. If he wasn't mistaken, the terrifying
          person who had killed this heinous and dangerous-looking demon was
          none other than Ophelia.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well.' Oliver had a blank expression on his face. Even in the demon
          lands, her name was famous, at least. The Witch of Death was a title
          she held in the novel that represented her. And from the words of this
          demonic woman, the demon depicted by the statue had died miserably.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, the Witch of Death—the person I admire and the person I want to
          kill the most…"
        </p>
        <p>The inquisitor spoke lazily, as if lost in thought.</p>
        <p>Admire and want to kill? This woman had issues. Serious ones.</p>
        <p>Crunch!</p>
        <p>
          Her hand, which had been gently grazing the statue's scars, suddenly
          crushed part of the statue, creating more cracks in the already
          crumbling figure.
        </p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          She turned and stared directly at where Oliver was standing, making
          his heart skip a beat. He hadn't felt this nervous in a long time. It
          was a chilling experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          His breath caught in his throat as a cold sweat broke out across his
          brow. All the inquisitors were terrifyingly strong, and the woman
          before him was no exception.
        </p>
        <p>But why was she staring directly at his hiding place?</p>
        <p>'This is bad… really bad…'</p>
        <p>The demonic woman wore a subtle frown as she looked ahead.</p>
        <p>'Why do I feel like I'm being watched?'</p>
        <p>
          The woman thought to herself. This feeling had started the moment she
          entered the temple, and it had persisted the entire time. She felt as
          though someone was observing her, and it made her feel uneasy.
        </p>
        <p>Something was odd, something she never felt before.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 230 &nbsp;So close! Discovered?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 230</p>
        <p>
          Yet, she couldn't sense anyone. Even while talking to the statue of
          her uncle, she had been constantly scanning every corner but found no
          one.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is this a coincidence? Or something more deliberate? Why do I feel on
          edge?'
        </p>
        <p>
          She pondered, her gaze intense as she looked at the spot where Oliver
          was currently standing.
        </p>
        <p>Tap, tap.</p>
        <p>
          Her heels clicked against the floor as she began walking toward
          Oliver, making him panic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though the Abyssal energy was shielding him, if the demon got too
          close or made contact with him, she would definitely discover him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as she reached out toward the Abyssal dome, a voice echoed in the
          temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Miss Sera." The voice belonged to a new arrival at the temple's
          entrance—a demonic man wearing the same inquisitor uniform as the
          woman, whose name was apparently Sera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's heart leapt with unexpected relief as the interruption came
          at the perfect moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera, who had been interrupted, paused, mere inches away from touching
          Oliver's face.
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned to look at the demon who had called out to her, and Oliver
          let out a relieved breath as he, too, observed the newcomer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man had red fur on his head, a halo of lightning arcing around his
          long metallic horns, and a strong mouth with fang-like teeth. His
          yellow irises seemed special—Oliver sensed subtle fluctuations from
          them. He knew at a glance that they were unique compared to ordinary
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The yellow irises swirled and churned like a desert sandstorm, while
          his red fur was crawling with bugs and matted with filth and
          excrement. His well-muscled arms ended in fingers tipped with sharp
          nails, and his legs were shaped like those of a goat, with black
          cloven hooves instead of feet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Finally, a thick tail swung back and forth behind him, its end shaped
          like a fused club of spiked carapace.
        </p>
        <p>The entire creature seemed engineered for violence.</p>
        <p>"Drul,"</p>
        <p>
          Sera spoke, not showing any of the excitement she had earlier while
          speaking about Ophelia and her uncle.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We have confirmed it; there was a fluctuation in space in the city,"
          the demonic man named Drul said.
        </p>
        <p>'Umm… what now?' Oliver paused when he heard this.</p>
        <p>
          "Your senses are truly exceptional, Miss Sera! To have detected such
          subtle fluctuations despite being miles away from the city…"
        </p>
        <p>The demonic man said with a tone of admiration.</p>
        <p>"Did you investigate the cause?" she asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, according to Vasoth, someone has entered the city illegally.
          From the faint traces and scent left behind, it was definitely a
          human. I analyzed the scent; it definitely belongs to a male human
          child."
        </p>
        <p>"A human child?" Sera raised a brow.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, miss, I'm not sure how a human child would enter the city like
          that either. I believe it's one of the schemes of those damned human
          bastards. No matter what, they wouldn't send a child here for no
          reason."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm…" Sera fell into thought and asked, "Did you find the human?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, actually, I followed the smell and it led me here, just outside
          the temple. Any trace of the scent completely disappeared, and inside,
          I sensed your presence…" He looked at her with calm eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tension in the air was thick. Oliver felt his pulse quicken as he
          waited for Sera's reaction, hoping his Abyssal cloak would continue to
          mask him.
        </p>

        <p>He was already low on Abyss energy and was worried.</p>
        <p>
          Sera looked back at him and narrowed her eyes. Dots connected
          instantly, and the unpleasant feeling of being observed could now be
          explained.
        </p>
        <p>
          'So it's true that a human has entered the city secretly, and a child?
          I doubt it. I couldn't sense him at all despite being constantly
          observed. There's no way a human child could deceive my senses.'
        </p>
        <p>
          "Seal the city. Have them dispatch forces to investigate every corner,
          ask Vasoth to search as well, and I think you've been deceived by the
          scent. It couldn't belong to a child. Try searching for an adult human
          man instead," Sera ordered.
        </p>
        <p>"This… I'm sure it was a child…" Drul hesitantly replied.</p>
        <p>
          "The human who intruded is quite clever. If I'm not wrong, he has
          completely deceived us by deliberately leaving traces of scent behind
          and masking it to resemble a child's scent, leading you here. Two of
          us three inquisitors are now here, while Vasoth is alone. It wouldn't
          be strange if the human has already escaped far."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What!?" Drul was stunned. Even Sera's senses had been deceived by the
          human; it sounded ridiculous. Sera was their captain and the strongest
          of the three.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, she was one of the most talented demons of her
          generation. There were hardly a few who could match her.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were all inquisitors on a mission sent by the central order. All
          of them were powerful in their own leagues; otherwise, they wouldn't
          be inquisitors. If a human strong enough to fool Sera's senses had
          intruded, then it was obvious the humans were planning something
          serious.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Aren't they talking about me?' Oliver smiled wryly as he looked at
          the two demons in front of him, discussing him and making plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          'They even seem to have a misunderstanding. This woman, Sera, is too
          cautious; she complicated things for herself.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt great that it turned out this way. It was better for them
          to think like this and be on high alert while he could maneuver
          secretly when they chased after the imaginary strong man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera's words quickly settled as Drul immediately rushed back to Vasoth
          since Sera alone was enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Drul left, Oliver's gaze flickered. He knew he had limited time to
          make his next move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes wandered around as he thought about his future plans.
          These demons were too clever; they had sensed the space fluctuation,
          which wasn't something an ordinary demon was capable of.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, the concept of space itself was unfamiliar to most people, be
          they human or demon, unless they were special.
        </p>
        <p>
          So for someone to be aware of such a thing, they had to be either an
          array master or a high-ranking individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera was definitely dangerous. She almost came close to discovering
          him just based on her intuition.
