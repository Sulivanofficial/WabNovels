        <h2>Chapter 111: Are You Even Human? The Helplessness of a Ghost</h2>
        <p>"Help! Please save me! I don't want to die!"</p>
        <p>
          A humiliated voice of the ghost sounded within Oliver as he paused.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Abyss energy clawing away at the ghost's body also paused
          momentarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had full control over the Abyss energy, and he stopped the
          torture for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing his pleadings had some effect, the ghost was overjoyed. He
          quickly begged the human child to release him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Child, if you let me leave for now, I will give you all my treasures
          that will make people drool. Please, just let me out this once. I was
          wrong when I tried to use force earlier. I have realized my
          wrongdoings and swear to never dare to look back and will repent my
          actions."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Enough of that. Tell me how you sneaked into human territory and
          state your purpose in doing so," Oliver stopped him from speaking
          further and interrogated.
        </p>
        <p>"Y-You know I am from the demon lands!?"</p>
        <p>
          The old ghost was shocked. He had not revealed this to the human yet;
          it was almost impossible for a child like him to know about his real
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          At best, even if he was knowledgeable for his age, he should still not
          have directly suspected him to belong to the demonic lands.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could also be that he was a leftover remanent of spirit instead of
          a demonic entity however this kid did not even hesitate and pointed
          out or concluded that he was a demon from the demonic territory,&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          He was in a spiritual form, and it was quite hard to point out
          differences between him and an actual spirit in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but feel it was impossible for a human this young to
          identify him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He suspected that Oliver was actually carrying a high-rank
          identification artifact to be able to guess this.
        </p>
        <p>'So, I have been the fool this whole time…?'</p>

        <p>
          He could not help but regret his lack of foresight ever since he
          entered the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that he was usually not this easy, but perhaps the situation
          and desperation has led him to become like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was very vulnerable and weak at the moment, his defense artifacts
          were all used up or destroyed by those pesky exorcists and he didn't
          even have the time to activate the ones with longer duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was so much going on that he had become like this, to get caught
          by a mere human child.
        </p>
        <p>Had he been influenced by the air these humans breathe?</p>
        <p>He could not help but feel helpless.</p>
        <p>
          Before the torment resumed, he explained to the kid his purpose and
          what had led him to this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          This child was really dangerous, this unknown energy that he had never
          felt or seen before was making his heart beat faster and faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not dare to lie, fearing the child might even have a
          lie-detector artifact with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was better to truly confess everything. He was already on the verge
          of death, and it was better not to try tricks against this strange kid
          and the strange corrupted energy he had never seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pain he felt was directly transferred to his very soul, it was
          nerve-wrecking and extremely painful.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought that even this human child did not realize just how much
          pain it was. The magnitude was very high.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but groan in a mix of fear and frustration, he had
          always thought that the demons were the ones who were cruel and
          sadistic but now he was having second thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the child alone was this twisted, he could only imagine how twisted
          his parents would be.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          He rarely had such close and long encounters with any humans, usually
          the ones he encountered would cower before him in fear before getting
          killed and devoured by him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His knowledge about humans was limited to the information recorded by
          others, but what he had always read was humans were emotional fools
          and could be easily manipulated by their primitive instincts or their
          feelings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon, he finished explaining everything from the start to how he ended
          up in this forest.
        </p>

        <p>"Hmm."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver hummed in response after listening to the old ghost's
          explanations; it did not seem that he was lying either.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes glinted with a sharp, calculating look, as if weighing the
          truth in the ghost's words. The hesitation was brief, but it made the
          ghost's form tremble in uncertainty.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, he really did not care much whether the ghost had snuck in
          intentionally or not or whatever his purpose was.
        </p>
        <p>He demanded, "Hand over all the treasures you have on you."</p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          The old ghost could not help but curse internally. The treasures he
          had were very precious, collected over his long life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It provided him some relief that he did not carry all of them with
          him. As long as he could get back to his home base, he could stock
          them again.
        </p>
        <p>
          He reluctantly took out a space bracelet from somewhere and held it
          out in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>"Here it is. This is all I have; you can search me."</p>
        <p>
          He held out the bracelet and said aloud, fearing that Oliver would not
          be able to hear him or something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered how it was going to be taken outside to the strange human
          kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in the next moment, his questions were answered when the same
          terrifying energy pulsed upwards and covered the bracelet, slowly
          making it vanish into nothing but darkness.
        </p>
        <p>"Alright, now tell me why you were hiding in the forest."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded, satisfied with his finds. He would inspect the gains
          later.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know there are spirits present in this old forest. You must know of
          it too, right? Considering you are a demonic ghost yourself. So the
          reason must have something to do with it too," he added.
        </p>

        <p>
          The old ghost shook his head. He had completely given up any hope by
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was completely at the whims of this human child; his survival was
          on the line here.
        </p>
        <p>
          How ironic it was that he was comparing the children of the demon clan
          just a moment ago to these human brats and was feeling gloating over
          how powerful they were, but now he was captured by the same human
          brats.
        </p>
        <p>
          This kid was ruthless and scheming; he wouldn't lack compared to them
          at all… he was simply a wolf in sheep's clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is as you say. There is a dormant spirit inside one of the ancient
          statues, but it is guarded by a powerful array, and I needed a
          physical body to decipher the array properly."
        </p>
        <p>
          The old ghost's voice trailed off for a moment as he said in a low
          voice, "If you're willing to lend me your body for a bit, I can break
          the array for you, then you will be able to… AGH-!"
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not even finish his sentence as the Abyss energy clawed at
          his body once again, making him regret even suggesting that.
        </p>
        <p>"I understand I was wrong! I was wrong! Please stop this!"</p>
        <p>He cried out as he kept pleading when the torment stopped.</p>
        <p>"So, what use do you have for me now?"</p>
        <p>Oliver questioned in a heavy tone.</p>
        <p>
          The old ghost's face could not be any paler at the moment as he
          anxiously said, "What do you mean? I have given you all of my
          treasures. You should let me leave. Please…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's expression remained unmoved, a mask of cold indifference.
          Inside, however, he weighed the potential benefits of keeping the
          ghost around versus the risks. His hand twitched slightly, as if
          suppressing an urge to further test the ghost's limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old ghost knew the chances were slim. He had been stalling for
          time to gather more and more espera to attack this human child.
        </p>
        <p>
          After catching him off-guard, he would escape. He had no plans to
          possess this strange kid anymore, fearing what unknown dangers might
          be waiting for him inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm?" Oliver just hummed as he pondered the various uses he might
          have for this old ghost. Given his current standing and power, he
          could not think of much.
        </p>
        <p>"I can't think of anything worth it."</p>
        <p>
          As soon as the ghost heard it, he frantically shook his head as he
          said loudly, "Wait, I can give you information!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Information?" Oliver raised a brow upon hearing the ghost speak, he
          could already feel the rising panic inside the old ghost's voice. It
          was natural to feel that way when you were suddenly captured and
          surrounded by the corrupt Abyss energy from all sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not knowing when it might attack and eat away your existence. Even the
          demons would fear being tormented in such a way.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Information about the demon territories, the military strategies, and
          many other things. You humans must want these secrets, right? As long
          as you are willing to spare my life, I will tell you everything I
          know."
        </p>
        <p>
          The old ghost was panicking inside. He still had not gathered enough
          espera to launch a surprise attack and escape. He had to stall for
          time.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 112: What do you think? Elder's question!</h2>
        <p>
          The old ghost was panicking inside; he still had not gathered enough
          espera to launch a surprise attack and escape. He had to stall for
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          What he had just said meant he was turning traitor to the demon race.
          But to him, his life mattered the most; he was an intelligent life
          form.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only great and powerful demons had the privilege of gaining sentience
          and intellect. He was not willing to go down like this in such a
          filthy forest.
        </p>
        <p>So he had to stall for as much time as he possibly could.</p>
        <p>
          He knew that these human exorcists would be willing to pay any price
          to learn the tactics or attack patterns from the demon territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, they would definitely reward this young kid if he went
          to them with this information. Not only would this kid receive fame,
          but also fortune.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being human, such things were naturally desired by them since they
          were born. If he could just take even the slightest advantage of this,
          he would be able to escape from here.
        </p>
        <p>But Oliver's next words made his scalp go numb.</p>
        <p>"Information? I don't need it."</p>
        <p>
          "WHAT!? Are you not aware of how much the humans could benefit if you
          reveal such information to them? They will even reward you handsomely
          for this! You will receive fame like no one—"
        </p>
        <p>"Quiet."</p>
        <p>Oliver bellowed, instantly silencing the ghost.</p>
        <p>
          "Two reasons," he started as he went up to a tree, lightly scratching
          the flaky bark, feeling the rough texture. He said, "There are two
          reasons that I don't need it. I will tell you…"
        </p>
        <p>
          "The first: I don't like fame. I could become famous if I wanted to
          right now."
        </p>
        <p>"The second: I already know everything you want to tell."</p>

        <p>
          The old ghost could not help but feel a chill when he heard the second
          reason. For some reason, he felt that Oliver was not joking with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          No sane human would refuse an offer to obtain secret intel about the
          demon territory; he had seen many in his lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>But how was that even possible?</p>
        <p>He already knows what he was going to tell him? Was this a bluff?</p>
        <p>
          The ghost didn't have the time to think as he felt the corrupted
          energy rapidly covering him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The torture resumed as he experienced the worst pain of his life in
          hundreds of years; his eyes burned in agony.
        </p>
        <p>He was going to die!</p>
        <p>
          "DIE–AAGH!" the ghost cried out as he released a burst of espera
          intending to harm Oliver. It was the one he had been saving until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, something unexpected happened in front of his eyes. The
          corrupted energy didn't even let the espera flow out. It consumed
          everything; even the espera was not spared.
        </p>
        <p>
          The old ghost had never seen something this bizarre in his lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
          In his final moment, all he heard was Oliver's faint voice as he
          mocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did you think that I would not know about your little trick? Bold of
          you to think that you could launch a sneak attack while gathering
          espera inside my own body without my notice. Hahaha."
        </p>
        <p>
          The ghost was fully consumed by the Abyss energy, no trace of his
          existence left behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt a stir as the Abyss energy seemed more powerful from the
          currents flowing inside his body.
        </p>
        <p>Observing the body analysis panel, he saw the following changes:</p>
        <p>___________</p>

        <p>[Name: Oliver Mystic]</p>
        <p>[Race: Human]</p>
        <p>[Status: Rank-1]</p>
        <p>[Strength: Level 5]</p>
        <p>[Espera: Level 4]</p>
        <p>[Abyss Energy: Level 4]</p>
        <p>[Charisma: Level 3]</p>
        <p>[Luck: Level 4]</p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>His Abyss Energy had increased.</p>
        <p>
          He didn't think that there was actually a way to grow the Abyss
          energy, but it seemed that devouring ghosts had an effect on the
          increment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unexpectedly, that old ghost was indeed quite powerful, or else he
          would not have seen such an increase.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered if he was lucky that he found the old ghost in such an
          injured and sorry state that he was able to devour it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the storage bracelet in his hand for a while. He could
          see a dark inscription on its surface.
        </p>
        <p>The storage bracelet was secured by a barrier-category rune.</p>
        <p>
          He would need to find a runesmith or a forger to remove this
          restriction.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since this rune was clearly the technique of demons, he would need to
          be careful. He could not easily reveal that he got this storage
          bracelet from an old ghost.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he did that, this thing would be directly confiscated by the
          authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would have to be careful in finding a blacksmith who was willing to
          do that for him or better just learn the ropes himself.
        </p>
        <p>He didn't like to be dependent on others after all.</p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver shortly returned to the gathering. In the end, he did not get
          to relax at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          He cursed that dead ghost in his mind and these useless elders who
          could not sense a demonic ghost being present and hiding inside this
          big forest.
        </p>
        <p>He wondered if they had gone senile.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey, Oliver, where did you go?" Bella smiled and asked him politely;
          she had forgotten the previous incident after gaining his forgiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Umm…" he looked at her before replying, "Nothing, I was just taking a
          stroll…"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh! I just asked the elders, and it seems we could begin training
          soon! We could duel with each other as much as we want during that. I
          can't wait for it!"
        </p>
        <p>She chirped excitedly as Oliver let out a wry smile.</p>
        <p>
          She was barely 9 years old and was already showing traits of being a
          battle junkie.
        </p>
        <p>He saw Evelyn was also looking at him with an eager look.</p>
        <p>
          He could guess the reason as well. She had always looked up to Bella,
          so since her sister was so excited to spar with him—someone of the
          same age as her, she was naturally curious about his skills too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her thinking went along the lines of, "Since my sister defeated him, I
          must be able to at least get an upper hand over him," or so.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at Nadia, and she averted her gaze, giving him a cold
          shoulder.
        </p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>This girl…</p>
        <p>After that, they left one by one, back to their respective clans.</p>
        <p>While they were in the car, the elder driving suddenly asked him,</p>
        <p>
          "What do you think about the older twin from the Celestial Paradox
          Clan?"
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 113: Exorcist Web! Using features!</h2>
        <p>
          While they were in the car, the elder driving suddenly asked him,
          "What do you think about the twins from the Celestial Paradox Clan?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, who was about to doze off, heard him and frowned. Why was he
          being asked this?
        </p>
        <p>
          "They were both talented. The older one is quite powerful for her age,
          and the younger one… she seemed harmless, but the air around her said
          otherwise. I personally wouldn't underestimate her either."
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm…" The elder just hummed as he kept driving.</p>
        <p>
          "What are your opinions on the Celestial Paradox Clan, then? After
          fighting her, you should have some realizations."
        </p>
        <p>'Again? What does this old man intend?'</p>
        <p>
          He answered nonetheless. "The Clan is a mystery of its own. I would
          say they are quite enigmatic. The martial arts technique that she was
          using was really intricate and powerful. I really liked that."
        </p>
        <p>"So you liked it…"</p>
        <p>"Yes, are you going to get it for me?"</p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          The elder went silent after that and drove in silence until they
          reached the clan.
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>
          Upon reaching the clan, Oliver didn't do much except revise his
          self-training to train his special eyes and other weapon techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was interested in the joint-training program and how they were
          going to be trained. It should be challenging nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a limit to how much he could train himself without proper
          guidance from someone with a great deal of expertise about the field
          beforehand. It was both time-saving and more efficient.
        </p>
        <p>
          He grinned as he thrust a spear he had bought some time ago in front
          of him. Well, the maid had purchased it for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          While leaving the forest, the maid was curious about where he had gone
          off to but did not suspect anything since he returned shortly,
          perfectly presenting an excuse that he was just there for a stroll.
        </p>

        <p>Practicing daily had now become a routine for him.</p>
        <p>
          Since he had nothing to do for the time being, he took out the
          smartphone he had received from Jenna.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan didn't provide internet facilities to him. Well, in the first
          place, the connections were made using espera signals in this world.
          The process was not explained in the novel, but it just happened to be
          done that way. The connectivity and speed were exceptional.
        </p>
        <p>'Welcome to Exorcist Web!'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver raised a brow when he saw the interactive design and familiar
          message. The words shifted and changed into another after the
          introduction.
        </p>
        <p>'Please input a command for voice recognition.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver had set up voice recognition last time when he got the
          smartphone; it was necessary to make this more secure.
        </p>
        <p>"Open," he said in a calm tone.</p>
        <p>
          A black scanner suddenly lit on the screen before new words appeared.
        </p>
        <p>'Voice Recognition has been successful.'</p>
        <p>'User Oliver confirmed!'</p>
        <p>'Proceed with a username? Yes/No'</p>
        <p>
          He paused for a moment. Last time, he was in a hurry and just went in
          without a proper username, but now that he was free and could explore
          it properly, he decided to have a username.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes."</p>
        <p>A small keyboard appeared with an empty name box instantly.</p>
        <p>
          He thought for a moment and then went through all sorts of names
          circulating inside his mind.
        </p>
        <p>'Winter Dragon'</p>
        <p>
          He came up with this name as his alias. From the novel, he knew that
          the security of the network was very high and his identity would not
          be revealed at all under normal circumstances, even if he used his
          real name.
        </p>
        <p>But he still felt it was better to use a pseudonym.</p>

        <p>'The Username is available.'</p>
        <p>'The username has been selected!'</p>
        <p>
          'To change the username, it will cost 10 billion Neden for the first
          time. The price will increase exponentially with the number of tries.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at the text with a nonchalant expression. He felt that
          they were quite outrageous. After a certain number of tries, it would
          be impossible to change the username.
        </p>
        <p>[Profile:</p>
        <p>[Name: Oliver Mystic]</p>
        <p>[Age: 8 years]</p>
        <p>[Race: Human]</p>
        <p>[Affiliation(s): Black Codex Federation]</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes narrowed. The information was too precise. It seemed
          that Jenna had already filled in details on his behalf before she gave
          the smartphone to him. Or maybe it was something else entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this was not the end. The loading was still active before he
          noticed an alphabet appearing at the corner of his profile. It was the
          alphabet 'C'.
        </p>
        <p>He clicked on the alphabet as information popped up next to it.</p>
        <p>[C-Tier Exorcist Account]</p>
        <p>'A C-Tier account? Not bad.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded to himself. The accounts were divided into different
          grades, and each grade had different privileges associated with them
          that were better as the tiers went up.
        </p>
        <p>
          After closing the prompt, he looked at the various other options
          available to him now.
        </p>
        <p>[Profile]</p>
        <p>[Exorcist Web]</p>
        <p>[Black Codex Web]</p>

        <p>[Bank]</p>
        <p>[Data]</p>
        <p>
          'Whoa… just selecting a username enabled so many features compared to
          before.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He exclaimed in a pleasant tone when he noticed the options that were
          not there before when he accessed it last time. He suspected that it
          was related to the previous method of selecting a username that he had
          not done before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he started to select options to see what exactly they
          were and their purpose.
        </p>
        <p>[Bank]</p>
        <p>[Total Balance: 20 million Neden]</p>
        <p>
          'Did Jenna make this account on my behalf? Well, that's a perk of
          being related to an organization, I think.'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver mused as he looked at the 20,000,000 figure with interest.</p>
        <p>
          'It seems she added all the amount from before when I sold her the
          artifacts. Efficient.'
        </p>
        <p>He nodded and closed the function.</p>
        <p>
          Next, he went up to the exorcist web to search for stuff that would
          interest him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He searched up the 'Metals' category to see if the material he was
          looking for was available or not.
        </p>
        <p>"It's there!"</p>
        <p>
          He stood up as his eyes widened in shock. He didn't expect to find it
          so easily.
        </p>
        <p>[Non-flammable Geoloril]</p>
        <p>[Current Price: 4 million Neden]</p>
        <p>[Time left: 4 months 3 days]</p>
        <p>[Bid? Yes/No]</p>
        <p>
          "But it's on auction… and the time limit is quite a lot. Nonetheless,
          I must bid it here. If the amount increases more, then I should
          prepare more funds in advance."
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that the material was extremely rare and he might even have to
          go through a lot to obtain it in the future. If he could, he must buy
          it when it was available.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Bid placed! Thank you for participating. The notifications will be
          directly sent to your inbox.]
        </p>
        <p>
          He directly bid 5 million Neden. He didn't fear getting scammed since
          he was aware that the Exorcist Web was highly secure and maintained
          proper regulations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did the identity of its users remain private, but the
          transactions were really authentic.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 114: Heretics! The bracelet?</h2>
        <p>
          He didn't fear getting scammed since he was aware that the Exorcist
          Web was highly secure and maintained proper regulations. This was the
          exorcist web not his local market where scams were rampant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did the identity of its users remain private, but the
          transactions were strictly monitored. If the other party somehow
          managed to scam someone, there would be serious consequences, and all
          the money would be refunded to the victim.
        </p>
        <p>
          After placing the bid, he put the phone in his mindspace and went back
          to his courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, he wanted to explore more, but he was a little scared about
          his impulsiveness. He had already spent 5 million Neden in one go just
          because he saw something he wanted for the future. Who knew how many
          other things might be there that he could not resist spending money
          on?
        </p>
        <p>
          So, he didn't dare to explore further and paused until he had more
          money in the future.
        </p>
        <p>He soon reached his courtyard.</p>
        <p>"Yawn…"</p>
        <p>The first thing he saw upon entering was a white fat cat yawning.</p>
        <p>
          Ignoring the cat, he called the maid and asked her to prepare food and
          a bath.
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>

        <p>
          In a place far away from the Mystic Purge Clan, a group of shady
          individuals dressed in pitch-black robes with hoods covering their
          faces were gathered around a table as they conversed.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had an ominous dark aura surrounding them, and an eerie feeling
          filled the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them spoke in a hoarse tone, "I have received instructions from
          the higher-ups that one of the demonic ghosts entrusted to the border
          was surrounded by exorcists."
        </p>
        <p>
          The others listened silently, but there was a hint of tension in the
          air when they heard him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fortunately, the demonic ghost was an expert who managed to escape.
          However…" he paused as he cast a gaze at all the people present inside
          the room, "…it seems that he accidentally entered human territory due
          to the situation."
        </p>
        <p>"What!?"</p>
        <p>"Here of all places?"</p>
        <p>
          Shocked voices could be heard as the expressions of the individuals
          who had been silent so far turned grim.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them immediately questioned, "Is he alive or has he been
          exorcised already?"
        </p>
        <p>
          There were murmurs in the group as they wondered how the demonic ghost
          made such a careless move to enter the lion's den.
        </p>
        <p>
          The human territory was the worst place for any demons. There were
          powerful and dangerous exorcists active throughout the lands, roaming
          everywhere. One slight mishap would directly lead to a painful
          exorcism by one such exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The one who had started this all spoke again, "According to the
          information I received last time, he should still be alive, or maybe
          not, in the worst case."
        </p>

        <p>
          The others quieted down when the man spoke, waiting for him to explain
          the purpose of the meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the demonic ghost was not alive, then what was the point of calling
          this meeting today? They could not help but be confused.
        </p>
        <p>
          "However, what matters is not his life but the thing he has with him.
          The higher-ups left something very important with him due to some
          confidential reasons, and we have to get him back if he is still
          alive. If not, then… the item should be retrieved no matter what."
        </p>
        <p>It took a moment for his words to sink in before someone reacted.</p>
        <p>"What!? That's a literal suicide mission!"</p>
        <p>"That's right! We don't even know where he is at the moment…"</p>
        <p>
          "Not only that, but what if the exorcists have already exorcised him
          and seized his belongings? Do we have to jump in the middle of those
          crazy exorcists to get that thing back!?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's a tough one… but master, you must have some leads on it,
          right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          One of them asked in a hesitant tone to the person who had informed
          them of this suicidal mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man looked at his subordinates without saying anything. Feeling an
          invisible pressure in the air, all of them slowly went silent one
          after another, eagerly waiting for his word.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are correct, I have a way. It was given by the higher-ups. The
          storage bracelet the old demon ghost was carrying has a location
          tracking rune embedded inside it. As long as the rune is not
          discovered, we will be able to find him and retrieve the item."
        </p>
        <p>
          The others eased up a bit after hearing that. It was still a doable
          task. They only needed to follow the location and get it back safely.
        </p>

        <p>"Then, Master, where is it located right now—"</p>
        <p>"Mystic Purge Clan."</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          The other men present could not help but feel cold after hearing the
          location.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing the location now reverted the situation back; the mission once
          again turned suicidal.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mystic Purge Clan was infamously known as the righteous
          slaughterhouse. Both exorcists and demons avoided that place like the
          plague.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering that place alone was extremely difficult for them. No, it was
          close to impossible. Not to mention the crazy-minded people of that
          clan. If they even get a whiff of them, the torture that awaited them
          would be unimaginable.
        </p>
        <p>"Master… that's…"</p>
        <p>They could not help but ask hesitantly, looking at their leader.</p>
        <p>Even he should know about the danger of the Mystic Purge Clan.</p>
        <p>
          Although their faces were covered with hoods, all of their expressions
          were identical at that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          They heard him speak again, but this time they could hear a hint of
          solemness in his tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am aware of what you all are thinking. However, we cannot refuse
          the order from the higher-ups. They are our gods!"
        </p>
        <p>
          His tone turned maniacal in the end as he chanted his beliefs aloud.
          Yet no one in the room stopped but rather looked at him with reverent
          eyes.

          They were a group of demon heretics, as termed by the exorcist clans,
          and they worshipped demons religiously as their gods. They were the
          servants of demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demonic heretics often had a belief: they should have been born as
          demons but instead were born as humans. They hated being humans and
          aspired to become demons and be recognized as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this was a twisted belief and psychotic thinking, they were
          offered the chance to become the servants of demons and thus turned
          traitors to their own race.

        <h2>Chapter 115: Disaster beasts? Further plan?</h2>
        <p>
          The demonic heretics often had a belief: they should have been born as
          demons but instead were born as humans. They hated being humans and
          aspired to become demons and be recognized as such.
        </p>
        <p>
          To them, demons were more of a superior life-form than humans were.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this was a twisted belief and psychotic thinking, they were
          offered the chance to become the servants of demons and thus turned
          traitors to their own race.
        </p>
        <p>
          The humans who shunned them and isolated them did not deserve them
          according to them. They were loyal to their demonic masters and helped
          them annihilate humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a demon, infiltration into a human-populated area was quite
          difficult due to their differing features. However, these individuals
          were different; they were humans in the first place and thus served as
          spies when needed.
        </p>
        <p>They spread havoc when ordered and eliminated when told.</p>
        <p>
          In exchange for all this, they were rewarded with superior power
          resembling and exclusive to their demonic owners.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those who performed very well were even promised a chance to become a
          demon!
        </p>
        <p>No one was sure how the process worked, however.</p>
        <p>But their faith was unshakable.</p>
        <p>
          "Master, what is this item that the higher-ups are so desperate to
          retrieve no matter what?"
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a momentary silence in the room before the man finally
          answered.
        </p>
        <p>"It is an egg belonging to a special disaster beast."</p>

        <p>"A disaster beast!?"</p>
        <p>"WHAT!?"</p>
        <p>"Impossible! How did they find something like that!?"</p>
        <p>
          "NO, the more important question is why did they leave it with the
          demon ghost if he was going to the borders!?"
        </p>
        <p>They stood up in shock; the news was too astonishing after all.</p>
        <p>
          Disaster beasts were the rarest beasts to ever exist in this world,
          especially the special disaster breed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout history, these disaster beasts could be counted manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was said that there were fewer than 40 such disaster beasts in the
          whole of history that had ever been seen or discovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          These beasts had always been found or born in extremely harsh
          environments and were very hard to detect.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were born weak, extremely weak—but their growth rate was almost
          unbelievable.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a difference between these disaster beasts and normal
          beasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          While beasts were born out of an excess of espera and harsh
          environments, they were not hard to find. The beasts were basically a
          product of excess of espera and the harsh environment they grew up in
          slowly shaping their existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Humans and demons both had them and usually formed contracts with such
          beasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beasts were low in intelligence until contracted most of the time.
          After forming a familiar contract, these beasts would become loyal
          familiars to their contractors.
        </p>
        <p>
          The large demonic beast that the elder used to transport children for
          the demon hunt event was an example for such beasts.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>
          There were many uses for beasts, such as for labor, transport, wars
          and whatnot.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, disaster beasts were a completely different breed of such
          beasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were ancient and extremely rare. They were named "disaster" for a
          reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could bring disaster to the world if they were properly
          cultivated and allowed to grow with their mystical abilities and
          powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the world was fair, and thus despite giving these disaster
          beasts unbelievable abilities, they were required to survive until
          adulthood. Born weak at birth, they were hunted by those around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was extremely rare for a disaster beast to grow up to adulthood.
          They were just like any ordinary beasts until they started to actually
          grow.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then that they would start to awaken their true abilities. And
          because of these reasons, finding just a single one was nigh
          impossible, not to mention controlling them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only way to establish control over them was when they were born
          just from their eggs, at the very first instance.
        </p>
        <p>It could be seen how much value this egg had for the demons.</p>
        <p>
          "Then we really have no option but to do it… but it's still suicide.
          How can we even enter the Mystic Purge Clan without getting detected?"
        </p>
        <p>One of them said in an agitated tone.</p>
        <p>
          "Calm down," the boss of the meeting said as he looked at them, "From
          the surveillance so far, I believe that it is in the hands of a casual
          exorcist from the clan. I don't know how or why, but it looks like
          that person has not shared the news with the clan. Perhaps greed? Or
          ignorance."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The tracker points to a remote and isolated corner of the clan, so I
          am sure of it. What we will be doing is simple. We will not be
          entering the clan; that is close to impossible. Rather, we will keep a
          watch on the clan and wait until the person leaves the clan. Then we
          will ambush and retrieve the storage bracelet."
        </p>
        <p>"What if he leaves the storage bracelet behind before leaving?"</p>

        <p>
          "I doubt the person will do that, given the precious contents inside.
          But if it comes to that, then we will have only one choice, which will
          be to infiltrate."
        </p>
        <p>"What of the demonic ghost? Is he alive or not?"</p>
        <p>
          "I am not sure about that. The rune only detects the location of the
          storage bracelet and not the owner itself. It could be possible that
          the ghost has already been exorcised or that he is still hiding, away
          from the bracelet."
        </p>
        <p>"Then what should we do about him?"</p>
        <p>
          "For now, nothing. Not until we are given specific orders from above.
          Our top priority at the moment is to get the storage bracelet back and
          the egg inside it at any cost."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was again a heavy silence in the room before one of them nodded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Master, if you don't mind me asking, do you happen to know which
          disaster beast is in the egg?"
        </p>
        <p>"No, I was not told about that."</p>
        <p>
          Actually, he knew, but he did not want to tell them. He did not trust
          them enough even with the binding marks; the disaster beast was a
          really big deal.
        </p>
        <p>If he told them what it actually was, they might become greedy.</p>
        <p>
          Even he could not resist himself when he heard whose egg it was
          suspected to be from the higher-ups, but thanks to his binding mark,
          he remained faithful to his gods.
        </p>
        <p>"I understand. I presume we get into action right away."</p>
        <p>
          The others also agreed; they had no options on this matter. It was a
          job that had to be completed one way or another.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed. You three will keep an eye on the clan. I will give you the
          detector to track the location at all times. The rest of you will be
          on standby and continue with the preparations for the ritual as we
          have been doing before."
        </p>
        <p>""Yes, Master!""</p>
        <p>
          The cloaked men bowed and left the room, leaving the man who was their
          boss alone.
        </p>
        <p>He fell into deep thought.</p>
        <p>
          'I can't shake off this ominous feeling that something bad is going to
          happen… No! I must obtain the storage artifact no matter what, or else
          I will die for sure.'
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes turned cold and an overbearing pressure descended into the
          room.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would personally make sure to oversee everything and retrieve that
          artifact no matter the cost.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 116: The elder's revenge!</h2>
        <p>
          It had been some days since then, and it was finally time for the
          joint-training program to commence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, they would be gathering again to meet Dennis Rivera, the one
          who had been chosen to be their instructor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was somewhat excited. Last time, he had missed the opportunity
          to bond with Evelyn due to the ghost incident, but this time, he would
          make sure to connect with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, there would be plenty of opportunities after all. They would be
          meeting frequently now that the program had been initiated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was picked up by the elder from before in that same luxurious
          car, along with Nadia and the maid.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed at the wealthy elder; the car was too impressive. He
          wondered if he would be allowed to drive it if he asked politely.
        </p>
        <p>'Maybe I would require a driver's license first, hahaha.'</p>
        <p>
          He curled his lips into a smirk as he imagined himself driving such a
          car in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia looked at him smiling to himself and felt he was as silly as
          ever.
        </p>
        <p>This time, they were taken somewhere else instead of the forest.</p>
        <p>He could see a huge mountain in the distance.</p>
        <p>
          It was on a mountain covered in mist. There was a fortress located at
          the top of the mountain, shrouded in that white mist.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was an ancient-looking fortress built atop a secluded mountain
          range surrounded by diverse landscapes such as forests, smaller hills,
          rugged areas, and plains.
        </p>
        <p>It was the perfect place for any type of training.</p>
        <p>
          As the sun set and the sky grew darker, the car arrived at the foot of
          the mountain and stopped in front of a dilapidated hall, which was
          most likely the entrance to the mountain and the fortress at the top.
        </p>
        <p>
          He watched as the elder parked the car and asked them to follow him.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as they entered the ancient-looking hall, Oliver smelled a
          strong scent of moist earth, plants, and damp rocks. It was a pleasant
          smell.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gazed at the insides of the hall carefully. The hall was a little
          desolate, with weeds growing in the corners.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was quite spacious, and there was a courtyard between the gate and
          the main hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the entrance of the hall was a statue of a figure in the middle
          whose face could not be seen clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were murals on both sides of the hall, but they seemed to be
          worn and falling off. There was a lot of burnt charcoal on the ground
          in front of the statue, probably left by passing travelers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder asked them to wait, and soon enough, Oliver saw all the
          familiar faces from before.
        </p>
        <p>They had come with their elders from the clan as well.</p>
        <p>
          He narrowed his eyes when one of the elders, the one from the Blue
          Crown Clan, took out a black elongated pen and started to draw some
          seals with the burnt charcoal present on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          He watched with interest. Amber, who saw this, went up to him and
          whispered.
        </p>

        <p>
          "The elder is drawing seals for exorcising evil spirits and setting up
          an early warning measure around this mountain hall. This is a
          necessary precaution when spending the night in the wild or unfamiliar
          places. Otherwise, those lonely ghosts and mountain beasts would come
          at night to hunt."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know of ghosts?" Oliver cocked an eyebrow at her, surprised that
          she had some knowledge about the subject.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What? Did you think I would not know about such a simple thing? Our
          clan is known for producing the best tool-based exorcists out there.
          With the variety of tools and artifacts I have grown up with, I am
          naturally familiar with these things."
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber frowned as she said this. She did not expect Oliver to have such
          a low opinion of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, you are right. It's my fault, haha," Oliver replied in a joking
          tone. He realized that his earlier wording might have been a little
          insulting to this noble girl, even though he had not intended it.
        </p>
        <p>Amber only nodded and stayed silent.</p>
        <p>
          She felt a little conflicted. Her mind wandered to the past event when
          she and Daniel had argued and then fought over it.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe that was the reason Oliver had a lower opinion of her…</p>
        <p>
          She went into her own world of troubled thoughts as Oliver approached
          the elder and stared at the runes with some interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would very much love to learn them, but he knew there would
          eventually come a time for this too.
        </p>
        <p>
          He went back and stood beside Bella. Tapping her shoulder, he asked,
          "Why is the elder forming seals to ward off ghosts or beasts? Aren't
          they powerful enough to just deter them with their presence?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella paused and glanced at Oliver with some confusion in her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you not aware?" she asked, her tone slightly unsure.</p>

        <p>Oliver blinked. What was it?</p>
        <p>Was there something special that he should have known?</p>
        <p>
          Seeing his blank expression, Bella chuckled slightly, guessing he did
          not know.
        </p>
        <p>"The elders will be leaving from here soon."</p>
        <p>"What?" Oliver thought he had heard it wrong.</p>
        <p>
          "The elders will be leaving us alone under the care of our new teacher
          for a few months."
        </p>
        <p>
          She said it calmly. It was the first time she was staying so far away
          from her clan and could not help but feel a little nostalgic and
          experience some strong emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The elders will be leaving us alone? For a few months? When did this
          happen?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but blurt out as he looked at her with confusion and
          shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Didn't the elder from your clan inform you of this? I think everyone
          knows about it," Bella replied and looked at the others, who seemed to
          be prepared as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver groaned in his heart; he really had no clue this was happening.
        </p>
        <p>
          No wonder, just the travel here consumed a few good hours to even
          reach the mountain's foot.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glared at the useless elder from the Mystic Purge Clan, his clan.
          Had the old coot finally gone senile? Or was his age taking effect on
          him that he forgot to inform such an important piece of information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder, seemingly feeling a strong gaze boring a hole in his back,
          looked back and met Oliver's angry eyes.
        </p>
        <p>He was confused for a moment before realization dawned upon him.</p>
        <p>He gave him a knowing smile and showed him the middle finger.</p>
        <p>'Fuck!'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver cursed as his eyes almost bulged out. The elder seemed to have
          intentionally hidden this information from him.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 117: Tall mountain! Who is at the top?</h2>
        <p>
          'Fuck!' Oliver cursed as his eyes almost bulged out. The elder seemed
          to have intentionally hidden this information from him. It was clear
          that he was exacting revenge for last time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver took a deep breath and calmed himself. There was surging
          hostility in his chest. He really wanted to beat this old bastard at
          the moment. But looking at the glowing espera of the other party, he
          decided not to.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I have some junk food stored inside, so it shouldn't be a problem for
          a few days. It's not like the new teacher would not give us food. As
          for clothes, I always keep a few sets of them prepared with me all the
          time. As for elixirs, fortunately, I had recently purchased a stock
          using the clan's money, so it's not going to run out anytime soon. I
          also have a batch of weapons with me as well.'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver sighed in relief as he rubbed his forehead.</p>
        <p>
          'Looking at it from an outer perspective, I am fully equipped and
          ready to survive in the wilderness, and this is not even the
          wilderness. So I should not suffer too much. It was just… more of a
          surprise element to say.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He calmed down and quickly got into his character again. He was thrown
          off-guard just now due to the dirty tricks of an old senile bastard,
          but he was still good thanks to the mindspace.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but be grateful for the mindspace he had obtained.
          He could always be prepared for unforeseen incidents such as this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          His storage ring was almost empty, after all, since he had developed
          the habit of storing stuff in the mindspace rather than the storage
          ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he made a quick note to himself to later exact revenge on
          this elder for sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elders bickered for a moment, exchanging some insights related to
          their espera and progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just as the children were waiting eagerly for the elders to finish up
          their business, a voice interrupted their chatter in the huge hall.
        </p>
        <p>"Hello there, are all of you gathered?"</p>
        <p>
          The elders paused and looked at the owner of the voice. It was an old
          man with a hunched back and short height. His face was seriously
          wrinkled, and he was using a cane to support himself as he walked.
        </p>
        <p>"These are all of them," one of the elders pointed at the kids.</p>
        <p>
          The hunched old man looked at them and let out a crooked smile as he
          introduced himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Welcome, children. You all can call me Sigfor, and I will be the one
          looking after your needs while you stay here."
        </p>
        <p>
          His tone was raspy when he spoke, as if he had not cleared his throat
          in decades.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt particularly irritating in Oliver's ears; he had great senses,
          so the voice was quite clear and loud.
        </p>
        <p>He unconsciously clenched his fists.</p>
        <p>
          The elders nodded. "This here is Sigfor. He was once an important
          comrade and is also the attendant of your soon-to-be teacher. Make
          sure to respect him."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, elder!"</p>
        <p>
          "Greetings, Sir Sigfor. I am Bella. My sister Evelyn and I belong to
          the Celestial Paradox Clan. We will be in your care."
        </p>

        <p>
          Bella came forward and politely bowed to the hunched man in white
          robes. She was the first to step forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What a sensible girl!" the old man laughed heartily as he patted her
          head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon, she was followed by others as well. Oliver also went up to say
          his greetings to the old man and helped Nadia with her introduction as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it was his imagination, but he felt the old man seemed to be
          colder to him as compared to others.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well then, say our greetings to their 'teacher.' We will be leaving."
        </p>
        <p>
          For some reason, the elder sounded funny, and the way he emphasized
          the word "teacher" was awfully suspicious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could see Sigfor frowning as well. It seemed that he also
          suspected something; however, he shifted his focus to the children
          soon.
        </p>
        <p>The elders left one by one, and soon it was only them and Sigfor.</p>
        <p>"Hmm… never mind them. Children, follow me."</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor motioned for the children to follow him as he left the main
          hall, taking them to the back exit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like that, they reached the base of the mountain. Oliver could
          see a roughly made path leading toward the top.
        </p>

        <p>
          His heart suddenly started to beat faster as he began to feel what the
          old man was about to say.
        </p>
        <p>And he was right when the old man started speaking.</p>
        <p>
          "I will introduce you to your first task. Your training will begin
          from now on. Every moment you spend in this place will be counted as
          your training. For the very first task, you all need to climb this
          mountain and reach the top. That is where you will meet my master and
          your teacher."
        </p>
        <p>"WHAT!?"</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso's eyes bulged out as he stared at the hunched old man and
          then at the towering mountain. His body could not help but tremble at
          the sight of the terrifyingly tall mountain.
        </p>
        <p>How did he expect children like them to even climb this thing!?</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's face also darkened as he looked at the fog-covered mountain
          top. He could not tell how tall it was actually. Did they really have
          to climb this? He was strong and had a good amount of stamina, but
          even that was not enough to give him the confidence to climb the
          mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes shone for a moment in an amethyst glint as he stared past the
          clouds of fog at the mountain top.
        </p>
        <p>He could roughly see the mountain top and calculate the height.</p>
        <p>
          It was around ten thousand feet (around 3,000 meters tall), as tall as
          any average mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be given a more realistic measurement, it was about 2 million times
          as wide as a strand of Spaghetti!
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver thought about how long it would even take them to complete half
          the distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sucked in a deep breath, not because of the height of the
          mountain but because, from the [Cosmic Void Gaze], he was able to see
          a figure standing on the very top of the mountain, at the very edge.
        </p>
        <p>And that figure was currently staring directly at them.</p>
        <p>
          From the blurry features, he was not able to clearly see their face,
          but the figure had long hair, so he assumed it was a woman.
        </p>
        <p>What was that figure doing there?</p>
        <p>And who was it?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 118: Sigfor's shift! Impossible task?</h2>
        <p>
          From the indistinct features, he was not able to correctly see their
          face, but the figure had long hair, so he assumed it was a woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as he could remember, the teacher they were supposed to meet,
          Dennis Rivera, was a male. So who was she?
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, he even felt the woman staring directly into his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their eyes met for a moment, and Oliver could feel an unseen pressure
          covering him for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's no way she can exert her pressure or espera from that height.
          Am I being overly sensitive?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had a serious look as he kept watching the woman before she
          averted her gaze and disappeared into the dense fog.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also stopped looking at the fog and focused on the situation at
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you kidding me? You expect mere children to climb thousands of
          meters? Not to mention how impossible this is, but it's a waste of our
          time! How long would it take for us to climb that giant?"
        </p>
        <p>Sigfor was calm as he observed their dramatic reaction.</p>
        <p>
          He huffed, "What brats! At your age, I could climb this mountain twice
          and still fight!"
        </p>
        <p>He spat near Daniel's foot.</p>

        <p>
          "You!" Daniel was infuriated at how quickly this old man was turning
          around his attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          He backed away from the area where the old man had spat, really
          disgusted by this sort of behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso was even more so. He almost had the urge to puke at this
          behavior. He had always been a gentleman and behaved properly in the
          clan. All the people he had ever met were high-class and
          sophisticated, so seeing such crude behavior gave him shivers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver observed this and felt it was going nowhere. The old man was
          grumpy and difficult, which he could attribute to old age, and the
          other party was not any better; they were spoiled children from high
          and mighty clans.
        </p>
        <p>He had to ask on their behalf.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver intervened, "Sir Sigfor, there must be a catch, if I am not
          wrong? You are a wise man, and I feel that you are aware of our
          capabilities better than we are ourselves. With your keen insight and
          decades of experience, you should have already made a plan for us,
          isn't that right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He slowly started to coax the old man, he was familiar with such
          people with inflated ego and pride, who used to think that their
          younger generation could never be right or never trusted their young
          ones in matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          While such people were annoying, they were easy to control and
          manipulate.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Humph! You are one clever brat!" Sigfor sneered as he looked at the
          silver-haired boy. For some unknown reason that he could not pinpoint,
          this kid had been giving him a strange feeling ever since he entered
          the mountain. It was as if ants were crawling on his back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he told them in a calm tone, "He is right. This mountain
          is special. The master has covered the entire mountain in a special
          array. The higher you climb, the more difficult it becomes to
          progress."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Given how weak you pathetic little brats are, I will be kind and
          generous. You only have to keep climbing the mountain until your being
          gives out. The place where you give out will determine the best course
          of training for you."
        </p>
        <p>
          "So it's like this." Oliver wiped imaginary sweat as he understood the
          task.
        </p>

        <p>
          "That's right. It's just that. You brats are just exaggerating these
          little things," the old man snorted.
        </p>
        <p>
          Isn't that because you didn't make yourself clear from the beginning!?
        </p>
        <p>
          Both Alphonso and Daniel wanted to argue but didn't say anything in
          the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          "However, one thing you must note is that the higher you climb, the
          more benefits you will have during the entire training period. This
          involves but is not limited to food, clothing, shelter, and other
          things."
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber frowned when she heard this. She was not too confident in her
          physical strength. So she asked, "Can we use tools or artifacts?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man spared her a glance and said, "You can, however, you
          better not. This is a test to determine your proper level. Using tools
          or artifacts is a necessary part of an exorcist's life. If you are
          confident in being able to do better with them, then be my guest."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I agree." Bella nodded and secretly gave Oliver a thumbs up. He had
          handled the situation well.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm." Amber had no intention to listen to them. She was a tool
          exorcist; her specialization was that if there were no tools, then
          there was no her.
        </p>
        <p>"What are you looking at me for? Start moving!"</p>
        <p>
          The old man Sigfor yelled at the bunch, making them jerk and start
          running up the mountain while secretly cursing this old man internally
          who yelled at them.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all of them had left, his expression softened. He slowly said to
          himself,
        </p>
        <p>
          "They are talented, too talented. I have never seen a bunch as bright
          as them before. Master will really be happy to see the future
          generation. I am sure all of you can exceed her expectations and fill
          that empty hole in master's heart."
        </p>

        <p>
          The old man looked sad for a moment as he reminisced about the past.
          The memories he had were not all pleasant, and there was darkness in
          the distance.
        </p>
        <p>He later shook his head to rid himself of such thoughts.</p>
        <p>
          "Especially those two kids. That boy is too strange, and that girl is
          like a hidden dragon waiting to be unleashed upon the world. Master
          should tune them into shape, sharpen their talents."
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but remember but that boy's deep eyes, he was not
          able to see past them. He felt a sense of threat from that little kid
          who had not even grow into adulthood.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The Mystic Purge Clan had really birthed something extraordinary this
          generation, he was sure of this thing. That boy was too strange, he
          was able to sense that golden-haired girl's immense talent at a
          glance.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when he tried probing that boy, he felt himself looking at a blank
          page. He was not able to sense through him at all.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it was an artifact that he had or something else entirely... he
          did not know but he was sure that his master would cultivate these
          bunch of kids into something far better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor glanced one last time at the mountain top and returned to the
          hall where they had gathered initially to do his own work.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had high hopes for the children to climb high both on this mountain
          and in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but place his hopes on them to end this long,
          never-ending war with demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then… why did those old men act so funny when they dropped by
          here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor frowned upon remembering their expressions earlier. He had
          known them since he was young and could tell they were up to
          something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after becoming elders of such reputed clans, they still dared to
          act and play tricks.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly inspected the runes they inscribed to find something out of
          the ordinary, but they seemed to be normal.
        </p>
        <p>Did they tell the children something I am not aware of?</p>
        <p>
          He looked back, but all of them were already gone, climbing toward the
          mountain top.
        </p>
        <p>He only hoped that they wouldn't offend his master or else…</p>

        <h2>Chapter 119: Daniel's struggle</h2>
        <p>"Pant… Pant… Damn it! How much have I covered so far!?"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel groaned as he looked down, only to see fog clouding his vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          He couldn't help but feel frustrated. He had been climbing for a while
          now but still couldn't see the mountain top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, the view below had also become obscured, making him
          feel chilly.
        </p>
        <p>One wrong step and it would be all over for him.</p>
        <p>
          His heart pounded in his chest as he contemplated the situation he was
          currently facing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shivered as he imagined his body turning into a bloody pudding.
        </p>
        <p>
          A gust of wind whipped around him, threatening to throw him off
          balance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That old man… he is a snake!" he could not help but curse that man
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was really resentful of the old man who was responsible for their
          current predicament. While this was said to be part of training to
          determine their standing and base, he still felt there must be better
          ways to measure these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why did it always have to be the hard way? Was there no other path to
          greatness?
        </p>
        <p>
          He was also skeptical when the old man said he could climb two such
          mountains in a row at their age.
        </p>
        <p>Surely, that was impossible?</p>
        <p>He clenched his fists, determination battling with doubt.</p>
        <p>That's what he had been telling himself.</p>
        <p>
          He looked up and frowned. Despite being fast and strong, he was still
          almost at the end.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each step felt heavier than the last, the weight of failure pressing
          down on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be specific, he was the second last in line among the other
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked above with narrowed eyes. Just above him was Amber; after
          her was Evelyn, then Oliver, and finally Nadia and Bella, who had been
          climbing non-stop.
        </p>
        <p>'Am I this weak?'</p>
        <p>
          His face darkened. He had been conserving his energy while climbing
          but still did not expect to be at the end of the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had initially thought that being someone from the Sacred Swords
          clan, specializing in producing the best physical exorcists, he would
          be stronger than all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But reality said otherwise. Even Amber, who had tied with him, was
          above him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could overtake them, but then he would be using a lot of stamina
          and energy. Using espera was also becoming difficult as he felt an
          invisible pressure slowly pressing him down as he climbed further up.
        </p>
        <p>His muscles burned with the effort, sweat pouring down his face.</p>
        <p>
          And while it was not a big deal to use espera to strengthen the body,
          using espera while others were not would be a strike to his dignity,
          so he did not use it.
        </p>
        <p>He was sure he could climb on his own.</p>
        <p>
          This thought made him more confident. Looking up at Amber, he was sure
          she was using some sort of tool or artifact to aid herself; otherwise,
          they would have been at the same level of climbing.
        </p>
        <p>He smirked to himself, feeling a small surge of confidence.</p>
        <p>
          And looking below him at some distance, he spotted Alphonso as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          It gave him some relief that he was not the last in line, at least.
        </p>
        <p>He still had some pride.</p>
        <p>But… looking at the figures of Nadia and Bella, he felt bitter.</p>

        <p>Why did they make it look so easy? Was he really that far behind?</p>
        <p>
          Those two girls were extremely strong—stronger than him, at least. He
          could tell by their speed and power.
        </p>
        <p>
          What surprised him the most was Evelyn. Clearly, she was the same age
          as them and not older like Bella, but she was also above him.
        </p>
        <p>
          A flicker of envy sparked in his chest, quickly replaced by resolve.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had not seen her fight during their last meeting, so it was
          surprising to see her climbing way above him.
        </p>
        <p>Did that not mean that even she was stronger than he was?</p>
        <p>He could not help but feel more annoyed.</p>
        <p>She was almost on the same level as that guy called Oliver.</p>
        <p>Of course, he could not forget about Oliver.</p>
        <p>That guy Oliver… was strong.</p>
        <p>
          He had witnessed his fight earlier with Bella, and he fought
          toe-to-toe with such an opponent. He was undoubtedly worthy as his
          rival.
        </p>
        <p>If Oliver could climb faster, then so should he.</p>
        <p>He gritted his teeth, pushing his body to its limits.</p>
        <p>
          A burst of energy filled him as his eyes turned more focused and his
          speed increased slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made a small note to reach up to Oliver first and then aim for
          Bella and Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>____________</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso, who was panting, looked at Daniel, who was above him,
          increasing his speed and cursed inwardly. Of course, he did not use a
          vulgar term, being the gentleman he was.
        </p>

        <p>
          He had been disheartened ever since he started to climb. He was given
          a big reality check.
        </p>
        <p>It turned out he was the weakest in the entire group of children.</p>
        <p>
          Being the last in line of all the other heirs while climbing towards
          the mountain top and not being able to match up to any of them, he
          felt truly pathetic. He was far from even the second last person in
          the line, Daniel too.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this moment, he wanted to scoff at his previous self during the
          meeting.
        </p>
        <p>
          How bold he was at that time, thinking about balancing the team and
          eliminating the weaklings who would be nothing more than weeds among
          the cream of the crop.
        </p>
        <p>Now, he felt the sting of his own arrogance.</p>
        <p>
          How audacious he was when he declared Oliver to be the weakest and
          most useless one of all…
        </p>
        <p>
          The memory of Oliver's distant figure way up seared in his mind, he
          was printing that sight into his memory, to prevent him from
          underestimating others again.
        </p>
        <p>
          How shameful it was for him to even think of removing Oliver from the
          picture just because he was weak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the situation was in front of him, he was in the last spot.
          Did that not mean he was the weed in the field?
        </p>
        <p>Did that not mean he should be eliminated from the group?</p>
        <p>
          It was obvious. If he followed his own logic and thinking, he was a
          burden to the team.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the future, he might drag others down with him, given his lack of
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>He was truly repentant for harboring such thoughts now.</p>
        <p>Once this was all over, he vowed to train harder than before.</p>
        <p>
          He had always been the best talent in his clan. He had always been
          respected by others and praised for being so talented.
        </p>
        <p>
          But those praises felt hollow now, echoes of a time when he thought he
          was invincible.
        </p>
        <p>He realized that he was just a big fish in a small pond.</p>
        <p>
          And now that he was exposed to the ocean, he realized he was nothing
          more than a small fish in a vast ocean.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were people out there way more powerful and talented than him
          despite being the same age.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to catch up to them in the future if he really intended to keep
          up with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The road ahead was long and arduous, but he would not falter. If he
          did then he would not be a gentleman.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 120: It should have been an easy victory</h2>
        <p>Oliver looked at the dense fog and felt dumbfounded.</p>
        <p>
          A normal person would not be able to see anything in front of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to his special abilities, he was able to navigate these roughly
          made stairs of rocks.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could feel a pressure bearing down on him. As he climbed higher,
          the pressure slowly increased.
        </p>
        <p>Was this some sort of tempering of the body or mind?</p>
        <p>
          He thought deeply; he had read about such things but never thought he
          would experience one in his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt like the gravitational pull was increasing with each step he
          took upward.
        </p>
        <p>
          He deliberately allowed Bella and Nadia to overtake him and followed
          behind, just next to Evelyn.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, they had to reach the top ideally. But naturally, it looked
          almost impossible to achieve, considering they were not even halfway
          up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is long…" he muttered as he racked his brain to think of a way
          out but couldn't find anything useful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like that, he sped up behind the two girls, trying to catch up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to his level 5 strength, he had not felt exhausted or sore even
          under the pressure so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew, however, that mental fortitude would be as crucial as
          physical strength in the journey ahead
        </p>
        <p>_____________</p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, Evelyn, who was also climbing the mountain just
          behind Oliver, could not help but stare at his moving back intensely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes were deep as she remembered her experiences so far and how
          she got to this stage.
        </p>
        <p>She could not help but reflect on how she had reached here…</p>

        <p>
          The memories of her rigorous training sessions flashed before her
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>She had been working hard since the time she could remember.</p>
        <p>
          Her goal was to become a strong exorcist to help those in need,
          providing a place where everyone could live comfortably without
          worrying about their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had heard of the terror demons always spread—killing children,
          committing all sorts of taboos one could think of. They were the worst
          beings alive.
        </p>
        <p>She disliked them and wanted them to disappear.</p>
        <p>
          She wanted every child to live in comfort without worrying about
          demons, to never live in fear of their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had always wished to see a future where they could live in peace
          without any wars or bloodshed.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, she knew such a thing was impossible as of now.</p>
        <p>
          Her parents had taught her from their experiences that being an
          exorcist was not easy. She didn't believe everything could change on
          its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exorcists are people who live on the boundary between life and death
          every day.
        </p>
        <p>They have hearts of steel and wills of stone.</p>
        <p>
          It was only through the great efforts of ancient exorcists that
          humanity had the peace they were enjoying now…
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, the lands would have long been consumed and destroyed by
          demons, and humans would have gone extinct.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to be strong and achieve a stage where she could make
          changes that would bring peace to every part of this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          If people in ancient times could do it, then what was stopping her?
        </p>
        <p>Talent? She had it all.</p>
        <p>Resources? She had them all.</p>
        <p>Encouragement? She had it.</p>
        <p>
          There was nothing she lacked, and thus she devoted herself to
          following the footsteps of her parents. Her mother was her greatest
          motivation.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the future she dreamed of, she wanted to be on a level where she
          could work together with her mother, restoring the peace everyone
          longed for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next to her mother was her older sister, whom she admired the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was strong, talented, extroverted, and smart—everything a role
          model could be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella was the role model for her. The first step to rising above was
          to catch up to her sister.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she could not even do that, then how could she dream of helping her
          clan?
        </p>
        <p>
          She worked harder than anyone, learning from her sister and following
          her everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Bella was training, so was she. As Bella grew stronger, the
          difference always persisted.
        </p>
        <p>She often wondered if she would ever be able to close that gap.</p>
        <p>She could never defeat her sister in a proper duel or basic spar.</p>
        <p>
          Her sister always thought two steps ahead of her. It was always a
          surprise when she learned something from her sister's actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a calmness Bella always maintained no matter the situation
          or the pressure she faced.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had never seen her sister being impulsive despite her craze for
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella was not a muscle-headed maniac. People often misunderstood her
          as such, but she knew better, observing her daily and practicing with
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was someone who maintained an equilibrium that seemed almost
          unattainable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella was definitely her role model as well as her rival… she didn't
          think anyone among her peers could match her sister…
        </p>
        <p>
          That was until they were invited to meet the heirs of the other five
          major clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Honestly, she was not expecting much other than some formal
          pleasantries that she was used to when she got to the location.
        </p>
        <p>
          And things were going as she had expected. No one spoke much and just
          observed the others. There was an eerie atmosphere around the table.
        </p>

        <p>Then came the people from the infamous Mystic Purge Clan.</p>
        <p>
          She was secretly expecting the heirs to be cold and sharp,
          representing the nature of their clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, she was once again taken off guard when she saw the laid-back
          guy in front of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not look like someone from the deadly Mystic Purge Clan. He
          seemed quite relaxed and… normal?
        </p>
        <p>
          His casual demeanor was disarming, a stark contrast to the crazed
          reputation that followed his clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched as he quickly started the conversation and easily
          assimilated with others.
        </p>
        <p>To some extent, he felt like her sister—extroverted and cheerful.</p>
        <p>
          He felt mature for his age to her—the way he talked, the way he
          carried himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, when she observed his features, his face, the one thing
          that stood out the most to her was his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were charming, intimidating and mysterious… she could not point
          it out, but they were captivating. She liked them.
        </p>
        <p>She felt depth in those eyes.</p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, his twin sister was a more accurate description of
          someone from the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>A word she could describe her with was…</p>
        <p>Cold.</p>
        <p>However, she did not speak to her much.</p>
        <p>
          Afterward, things went from a peaceful meeting to slightly aggressive,
          where they decided to have a duel to familiarize themselves with each
          other.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she was left behind since the participants were an odd number, so
          she just observed others. A bit disappointed, but nothing much.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would see how others would do, being the heirs of major clans in
          the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          She observed each match intently, analyzing strengths and weaknesses,
          storing away knowledge for future encounters in case it was required.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia won one-sidedly. She was strong.</p>
        <p>But what truly interested her was her sister's match.</p>
        <p>It was against that silver-haired guy, Oliver.</p>
        <p>
          Bella was the oldest among the bunch by age, so it was understandable
          for her to be the strongest given her talent.
        </p>
        <p>It should have been an easy win…</p>
