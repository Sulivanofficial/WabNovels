        <h2>Chapter 161 &nbsp;Spirit Summoning Array!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 161</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes narrowed at that, memories of their arrival flooding
          back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Isn't that the same array that the elder from the clans had drawn
          before leaving us here?" he muttered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are right," Sigfor commented as he continued tracing his finger
          down the boundaries of the array.
        </p>
        <p>
          One could clearly see that the moment or portion where Sigfor's finger
          passed by was lighting up in a strange dim color. The glow pulsed
          softly, casting an eerie yet comforting light on the surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>A mellow orange color soon covered the whole array.</p>
        <p>
          "Elder, what is this?" Oliver could not help but be curious. He was
          very interested when the elder first drew these arrays. However, at
          that time, he was forced to forget about it due to the nonsensical
          stunts that his clan elder had pulled on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          And afterward, with all that mountain climbing and training elements,
          he had completely forgotten about these arrays. But now that Sigfor
          was using them, he could not help but be curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is a spirit summoning array," he answered. "The array is used for
          those who cannot connect to the spirit realm on their own."
        </p>
        <p>"Then that means…" Oliver paused.</p>
        <p>
          "That's right, it's for you kids to be able to summon spirits
          temporarily and borrow their powers for some time. You all can't
          connect to the spirit realm as you are now."
        </p>

        <p>"…Ah, did the elders already know about it?" he further asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm, that's obvious, how could they not know?" Sigfor said in a
          straight tone.
        </p>
        <p>It now made sense for them to draw these arrays beforehand.</p>
        <p>
          He turned towards Amber and asked, "Did you also know about these
          arrays?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She shook her head. "I did not know either; I only recognized the
          ghost repelling array over there."
        </p>
        <p>
          Her finger pointed to a barely visible set of symbols etched into the
          ground, glowing faintly in the corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pointed to an array in the corner and said, "But now it's making
          sense. I was initially confused why they were preparing a ghost
          repelling array in this place when a veteran exorcist like Elder
          Sigfor was here. But since there's a spirit array nearby, it could
          attract ghosts from far away as well—disturbing the summoning."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver agreed with her hypothesis; it all fit into place now. He
          nodded, piecing together the logic behind their preparations.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ghost repelling array completely blocked off any demonic ghosts
          with ill intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the spirit summoning array worked in a way that connected the
          individual to the realm of spirits. It was a metaphysical place, after
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air around them seemed to whiz with energy, anticipation building
          among the group.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Once you are connected to the realm of spirits, you will try to
          attract the spirits of your elements by releasing your espera
          outwards. It should work fine. Remember not to get lost and try
          attracting other elemental spirits; you can't handle two elements
          right now."
        </p>
        <p>Sigfor issued the instructions in a serious voice.</p>

        <p>
          "Especially you, noisy brat," he looked towards Daniel and said,
          making him jerk his head.
        </p>
        <p>Daniel's cheeks flushed as the group chuckled softly.</p>
        <p>
          "W-What!? I am not noisy!" he quickly denied the false allegations
          with a flushed face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Also, why are you only saying this to me!?" he pointed at others and
          asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing his words, Sigfor sighed, "Listen, brat, if you continue to be
          like this, then I will exclude you from summoning spirits."
        </p>
        <p>
          At that, Daniel had no choice but to shut up. He mumbled under his
          breath, but the glint of excitement in his eyes didn't fade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor then looked at the others. Amber suppressed a laugh. He said,
          "This applies to all of you. Don't be overconfident and try to attract
          more than what you can handle. Understand?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, elder!" they nodded and replied in unison. Their voices rang out
          strong and clear, determination evident on their faces.
        </p>
        <p>"Better. Now come one by one; I will help you," he said.</p>
        <p>
          Daniel, being the guy he was, strode first. He looked fearless and
          excited. His steps were almost a skip as he moved forward, his
          eagerness quite evident.
        </p>
        <p>"I am here!"</p>
        <p>"You are the first?" Sigfor gave him a look.</p>

        <p>"W-What's with that look, elder?" Daniel frowned and asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Hurry up and get inside." Sigfor waved his hand, and Daniel's body
          was pulled into the array on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          The force was gentle yet insistent, like an invisible hand guiding him
          into place.
        </p>
        <p>"Now close your eyes and focus. Don't think about other things."</p>
        <p>
          Once he was properly positioned, Sigfor told him to close his eyes as
          he channeled espera into the array, thus activating it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A low hum filled the air, the energy of the array responding to
          Sigfor's command.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          A smooth sound was heard as Daniel was soon enveloped in a light as he
          concentrated.
        </p>
        <p>The light shimmered around him, creating a cocoon of energy.</p>
        <p>
          Time ticked by as everyone waited for Daniel, watching him from time
          to time. No one talked much for fear of distracting him and ruining
          his summoning, although that was unnecessary since, according to the
          elder, he was already in the spirit realm trying to attract a spirit.
        </p>
        <p>Fwoosh!</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, the array reacted as the orange light grew brighter and
          brighter with each passing second.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haah…" Daniel exhaled as he slowly opened his eyes. His eyes held a
          hint of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          A faint smile tugged at his lips, the light in his eyes reflecting the
          power he now held.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the next instant, a strong crackling sound was heard just beside
          him as a streak of lightning buzzed. It was a blue streak that was
          barely visible due to its speed. It was continuously circling his
          body, making it look as if Daniel was crackling with thunder.
        </p>
        <p>
          The energy danced around him, vibrant and alive, filling the air with
          a sharp, electric scent.
        </p>
        <p>He got up, looking at the others, and grinned broadly.</p>
        <p>"I managed to summon a spirit!"n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om</p>

        <h2>Chapter 162 &nbsp;Evelyn's turn</h2>
        <p>Chapter 162</p>
        <p>
          He took out his sword, and the roaming thunder streak merged with the
          blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sword seemed to vibrate with strong power, glowing with a fierce,
          electric blue.
        </p>
        <p>
          He swung the sword, and a wave of lightning thunder traveled from it,
          directly blasting apart the wooden chair he aimed for.
        </p>
        <p>"This is power! Hahaha!"</p>
        <p>
          He laughed as he swung his sword a few more times, properly adapting
          to the power of the spirit. Each swing felt more natural, the sword
          becoming an extension of his own arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each swing sent arcs of lightning through the air, his laughter
          mingling with the crackle of electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright, brat, get back. Next one, come forward." Sigfor nodded and
          called for the next person to step up.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was internally satisfied that Daniel managed to summon a thunder
          spirit, matching his attribute. While it was an unranked spirit, it
          was still impressive for his age.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this world, except for children born with a contracted spirit, very
          few could summon one before the age of ten.
        </p>
        <p>
          And while Daniel was swinging his sword, Sigfor managed to glimpse
          something more from his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          A faint glow pulsed around Daniel, indicating a deeper connection to
          the thunder element than he had initially thought.
        </p>

        <p>
          If his guess was correct, Daniel was most probably born with a special
          constitution. It was likely related to the thunder element itself,
          given how effectively he could conduct the spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber went next. The same thing happened, and in the end, she managed
          to summon an Earth spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small, glowing figure of rock and soil danced around her fingers,
          responding to her every command.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tiny pebbles floated around her hand, creating a delicate and
          intricate orbit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next was Alphonso, who, after some difficulty, managed to summon a
          Wind Spirit. He took almost five whole hours to summon the spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air around him swirled gently, lifting his hair as a faint whisper
          of wind echoed in the hall. Each breath he took seemed lighter, as if
          he was in sync with the very air itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          After he was done, Nadia went forward, and within minutes, a chilling
          ice spirit was at the tips of her fingers. It was still and
          controlled—fully obedient to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tiny figure of frosty light clung to her hand, the air around her
          cooling noticeably. A thin layer of frost spread from her fingertips,
          glistening like morning dew.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor praised her; she was definitely extremely talented to be able
          to summon a spirit so quickly.
        </p>
        <p>"Next."</p>
        <p>It was the protagonist's turn!</p>
        <p>
          It was Evelyn that went up next. The moment she stepped in, the array
          began to work on its own without any input from Sigfor, making him
          surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          'She can already connect to the spirit realm at her age!? Impossible!'
        </p>

        <p>
          His eyes went wide when he saw her effectively activate the array
          without doing anything. His body shook slightly; he had never seen
          such a genius before.
        </p>
        <p>
          'This girl is a true monster!' he deduced instantly, his heart racing
          wildly as he imagined the boundless potential of the girl.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The Celestial Paradox Clan has produced a true monster this
          generation!'
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn was already plenty talented. With her light element, Sigfor
          knew that there would be few who could stand against her in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not even a minute had passed before a blinding white light covered the
          entire array. It was so bright that people felt it was akin to staring
          at the sun!
        </p>
        <p>
          The light radiated warmth, filling the room with a serene, comforting
          glow.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the light slowly started to dull, they all saw Evelyn standing, and
          in front of her was a floating ball of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          "T-This is an intelligent spirit!?" Sigfor muttered in absolute shock
          as he immediately went forward, standing next to her, observing the
          ball of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elder, can you explain what you meant?" Oliver asked from behind,
          making him come out of his trance.
        </p>
        <p>He coughed twice as he cleared his throat.</p>
        <p>
          "While this should not be of use to you, now that the situation
          demands it, I will tell you, spirits are classified into ranks
          depending on their rarity, power, and abilities."
        </p>
        <p>"What rank?" Amber wondered.</p>
        <p>
          "Spirits are classified by the exorcists' union from D-rank to S-rank.
          The higher the rank a spirit is classified into, the stronger it is.
          S-rank being the strongest and D-rank being the weakest."
        </p>

        <p>"Woah! What rank is my spirit, elder?" Daniel asked.</p>
        <p>
          "Your spirit has no rank; it's not a true spirit in the first place
          but just a fragment of a true spirit without any intellect."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What…?" Disappointment flickered across Daniel's face, but he quickly
          masked it with a determined expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But this is not something to be disappointed about. Just managing to
          summon a partial spirit alone is very hard for children like you. Only
          true geniuses with great affinity to their elements ever manage to
          summon spirits at such an age."
        </p>
        <p>Hearing Sigfor's words lifted his spirits a little.</p>
        <p>Oliver asked, "Then what about her spirit?"</p>
        <p>He pointed at the floating light ball.</p>
        <p>
          "It's a spirit close to the peak of D-rank." n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's words sent the kids into an uproar as they quickly surrounded
          Evelyn, or more likely the light spirit floating aloof. The light
          spirit seemed to shimmer with pride, basking in their admiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling the gazes of so many children, Oliver felt the spirit puff up
          slightly, turning into a slightly bigger ball.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Amazing…' His eyes were fixed on the spirit. The next moment, his
          eyes shone with a certain purple glint as he used [Cosmic Void Gaze].
        </p>
        <p>
          The spirit was radiating a potent and pure light-attributed esper—a
          very dense one at that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he could feel a warm and fuzzy feeling just being near
          the spirit.
        </p>
        <p>It was truly a spirit of light.</p>
        <p>
          "Well done, Evelyn," Sigfor patted her shoulder as he congratulated
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, elder," she bowed and thanked him. Turning around, she
          smiled and looked at Oliver, "It's your turn now."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver smiled as well. He did not know what he was going to summon.
        </p>
        <p>
          'It might become quite interesting…' he smirked as he slowly stepped
          inside the array. He was eager to see what he could summon.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 163 &nbsp;No spirits! Summon from Abyss?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 163</p>
        <p>"Now close your eyes and focus."</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor's voice came out as Oliver closed his eyes and started to
          concentrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air around him seemed to hum with energy as his surroundings
          blurred and transformed. A sensation of weightlessness enveloped him,
          and he knew he had entered the spirit realm.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment Oliver closed his eyes, his surroundings changed. He was
          instantly connected to the spirit realm—matching the speed Evelyn had
          displayed earlier, maybe a bit faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          A faint hum resonated in his ears, the energy of the spirit realm
          enveloping him.
        </p>
        <p>"Is this the spirit realm?" he opened his eyes and thought.</p>
        <p>
          Opening his eyes, he was met with a mesmerizing sight. Countless
          colorful lights floated in the hazy expanse, each one pulsating with a
          life of its own. 'Are they spirits?' he wondered, feeling a mix of awe
          and trepidation.
        </p>
        <p>He wondered.</p>
        <p>'Should I reach out to them?'</p>
        <p>
          Hesitation gripped him for a moment, but curiosity and determination
          pushed it aside.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the countless lights, he was not sure how to attract them
          towards him, the elder said to do what he felt was right.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stretched his hand towards the brilliant lights and he paused as a
          huge blue colored ball was speeding towards him.
        </p>

        <p>No… not one but… n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om</p>
        <p>
          But a tsunami of blue colored balls of light were speeding towards
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          A massive blue orb hurtled towards him, followed by a wave of similar
          orbs.
        </p>
        <p>His eyes widened as he subconsciously took a step back.</p>
        <p>Was this the normal setting?</p>
        <p>Wait, was it even safe in the first place.</p>
        <p>
          As he felt the countless balls of blue lights approaching him, he
          weighted his choices to whether run away from them or stay still and
          let them approach him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, he stood rooted on the spot and let the spirits approach
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, something unexpected happened as soon as they came in one
          meter radius of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          To his surprise, the blue lights halted just before reaching him, then
          scattered as if repelled.
        </p>
        <p>"???"</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the scene confusedly, wondering what was wrong with these
          spirits?
        </p>
        <p>
          Weren't they quite excited to approach him a second ago, so why were
          they running away now as if they had seen a ghost?
        </p>
        <p>He looked around but there seemed to be nothing around.</p>

        <p>
          'What's going on?' he thought as he walked up to the nearest cluster
          of colorful brilliant lights.
        </p>
        <p>
          He observed closely as he walked towards the cluster of lights, he
          could see it shifting away—backing out from him as soon as he was
          close to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What…?" he let out a small voice as he reached up to more clusters
          but the result remained the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tried approaching spirits of ice element, but still the same
          result.
        </p>
        <p>
          He even tried reaching out to the other elemental spirits but the end
          output remained similar—all of them backed away as soon as he neared
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A vein popped on his forehead as took in the disrespect from these
          balls of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confusion clouded his mind. 'Why are they avoiding me?' he thought,
          approaching another cluster, only to watch them retreat as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this continued, wouldn't he have to return without summoning a
          spirit?
        </p>
        <p>No, he can't have that.</p>
        <p>If they won't come to him then he would go to them.</p>
        <p>
          If they won't follow him obediently then he could only resort to
          force.
        </p>
        <p>"So be it…!"</p>
        <p>
          He said as he sped up towards a nearby cluster, the cluster of balls
          seemingly afraid of something tried to run away too however it was too
          late, Oliver had already reached up to them using his enhanced speed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He instantly stretched out his hand up to the spirits, grasping them
          within his palms.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the spirits simply slipped through his fingers like water
          taking him off guard.
        </p>
        <p>
          'How do I catch them!?' he groaned and thought, frustration was
          welling up inside him.
        </p>
        <p>His eyes narrowed; it looked like he should use 'that.'</p>
        <p>
          A dark thought crossed his mind. 'If I can't summon them, I'll force
          them.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He grabbed onto another fleeting energy as a reddish-black aura began
          to ooze from his hand. Instantly, all the spirits in proximity
          trembled as the abyssal energy was released.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air around him grew colder, the very essence of darkness seeping
          into the atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt the spirit in his grasp struggle frantically, trying to
          escape, but the abyssal energy held it firmly. It struggled in vain,
          and soon it was completely devoured by the darkness. A faint, echoing
          scream was swallowed by the abyss, leaving only silence in its wake.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he wondered what might change, something happened when he finished
          devouring the spirit. It was as if the spirit was a trigger…
        </p>
        <p>
          An influx of unknown knowledge that he could not decode revealed
          itself, displaying a torrent of information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Symbols and ancient runes flashed before his eyes, each one burning
          into his mind with searing clarity.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stood motionless, eyes fixed on the ceiling, as he processed the
          new insights. Time seemed to stretch endlessly until, finally, he
          tilted his head back and looked down at his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reddish-black aura still lingered, pulsing gently like a
          heartbeat.
        </p>
        <p>"So it's like this," he muttered.</p>
        <p>
          According to the information he had received, he would not be able to
          summon a spirit ever due to being the circuit of Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>Spirits were nothing but nourishment for him at this point.</p>
        <p>
          But something else had also unlocked for him in exchange for not being
          able to summon spirits.
        </p>
        <p>Anti-spirits!</p>
        <p>
          Anti-spirits are entities born from the Abyss, designed to counter and
          destroy regular spirits. They are manifestations of dark energy—a
          representation of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their forms were shadows, flickering and shifting, filled with a cold,
          consuming hunger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike regular spirits, anti-spirits are tethered to his will, making
          them extensions of his power.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 164 &nbsp;Devouring Spirits! Nourishing Abyss energy!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 164</p>
        <p>
          Unlike regular spirits, anti-spirits are tethered to his will, making
          them extensions of his power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which basically means that unlike regular spirits, which might have
          their own consciousness or require a contract, anti-spirits are
          extensions of the summoner's power and obey his commands without
          question. They are bound to his will and cannot act independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          This connection ensured that the summoner has complete control over
          their actions and abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as there is matter in the universe, with its opposing force being
          anti-matter, there are spirits, ethereal beings of light and energy,
          countered by anti-spirits, dark entities born from the Abyss. While
          spirits embody harmony and life, anti-spirits are manifestations of
          chaos and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          They are the shadows cast by the light, existing to counterbalance and
          consume the energies of their brighter counterparts. Where spirits
          thrive on purity and connection, anti-spirits draw power from the
          void, tethered to the summoner's will and feeding on the essence of
          the spirits they devour.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could feel the dark energy thrumming through his veins, a part of
          him now more than ever.
        </p>
        <p>
          If spirits were affiliated with the heavens, then anti-spirits were
          associated with the Abyss. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          The more spirits he consumes, the stronger his anti-spirits become.
          This creates a continuous cycle of power, as each defeated spirit
          enhances his abyssal spirit's abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, summoning them comes at a cost. Prolonged use can strain the
          summoner's body and mind, leading to physical and mental fatigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          His head throbbed slightly, a reminder of the toll this power could
          take.
        </p>

        <p>
          In a fight, he would have to be cautious not to harm himself
          unintentionally instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "However, now that I am here…" he paused, glancing around at the
          countless clusters of light, "Why don't I make use of it?" His voice
          was calm, but his eyes gleamed with a dark determination.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes turned cold as a storm of Abyss energy started to brew behind
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The space trembled, trying to hold onto the manifestation of the
          abyss. A low, ominous rumble echoed through the realm, the very fabric
          of reality seeming to stretch and twist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The spirit clusters burst, scattering in a direction as far as
          possible from him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Panic rippled through the spirits, their once serene forms now
          flickering with fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not stand by and followed after as many spirits as he saw. His
          movements were swift, precise, the abyssal energy trailing behind him
          like a shadow.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          What transpired next was a mass of reddish-black energy devouring
          countless colorful balls of light. Each spirit he consumed added to
          the growing storm of power around him, the reddish darkness becoming
          more intense with every passing moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time flowed by, and he lost track of time as he hunted down any
          spirits he saw. It was a pity that this place only held the partial
          spirits; he would have loved to try against a true spirit.
        </p>
        <p>However, the abundance of the partial spirits made up for that.</p>
        <p>
          Just like that, more and more time passed, and in the end, he finally
          stopped. His breath came in ragged gasps, the exertion of his power
          taking its toll.
        </p>

        <p>"Hmm…"</p>
        <p>
          As far as he could see, all he could see now was pitch-black darkness.
          The earlier space, which was filled with countless bright lights, was
          now a black realm devoid of light.
        </p>
        <p>
          The oppressive silence now heavy on his shoulders, the once vibrant
          realm now eerily still.
        </p>
        <p>"I can't go on anymore like this."</p>
        <p>
          He frowned and muttered to himself. This was as far as he could go;
          all the spirits in this space had mostly been devoured by him, while
          some of them escaped far away, so he did not chase them too far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, he felt a restriction on him when he reached a certain point. No
          matter what, it seemed that he was unable to cross a specific point.
        </p>
        <p>
          An invisible barrier pulsed at the edge of his consciousness, warning
          him of the limits of his current power.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if the place, the realm, was able to recognize his abilities
          and stopped him from going any further.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not push it either; he was not overconfident in his abilities.
          He had only devoured the partial spirits, after all. He could feel the
          growth in his Abyss energy too.
        </p>
        <p>
          What Oliver did not know was that these partial spirits were quite
          powerful, and no normal kid would be able to hunt them down as he was
          doing. In fact, even proper exorcists would find it difficult to
          capture spirits.
        </p>
        <p>
          After making sure there was nothing else to do anymore, he simply
          focused inside himself and started to leave the spirit realm.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not summon an Abyssal creature into this world; not only
          would it be extremely dangerous, but it could also get him into a lot
          of trouble with his body and others.
        </p>

        <p>
          The thought of the chaos and destruction such a creature could cause
          made him shudder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon, his body disappeared, and he opened his eyes back in the
          mountain hall. But something was strange; except for the elder, there
          was no one else present.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hall was eerily quiet, the faint light casting long shadows of the
          pillars across the room.
        </p>
        <p>"Damn brat, finally finished?"</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor said in a heavy voice. Oliver looked at him confusedly, "Elder,
          what do you mean? Where's everyone?"
        </p>
        <p>"I dismissed them since you were taking so long."</p>
        <p>"Long? Wait, what does that even mean?"</p>
        <p>
          "How long do you think you have been in the spirit realm?" Sigfor
          questioned him instead of answering.
        </p>
        <p>The elder's eyes were tired, a hint of impatience in his tone.</p>
        <p>"Well, maybe two hours?"</p>
        <p>
          "Haah? Two hours, seriously?" Sigfor pinched his brows in frustration.
        </p>
        <p>"It's been over five days."</p>
        <p>
          "What!? HOW?" Oliver lost his composure and asked wide-eyed. He could
          not believe that he had spent five whole days in that place!
        </p>
        <p>His mind reeled, trying to grasp the enormity of lost time.</p>
        <p>What's going on?</p>
        <p>"H-How can it be five days…?"</p>
        <p>
          He could not believe that hunting spirits would take so much time. In
          that dark realm, he really lost the sense of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How would I know?" Sigfor snorted and then asked, "Did you manage to
          get a spirit?"
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 165 &nbsp;Sparring with each other!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 165</p>
        <p>"Did you manage to get a spirit?"</p>
        <p>
          He looked seriously annoyed; after all, he had not moved from his
          position in the past five days, carefully watching over him so as to
          ensure that nothing dangerous would happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well… I did not." Oliver scratched the back of his head and said, a
          little embarrassed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor shook his head and sighed, "I expected as much. It does not
          take such a long time for anyone to summon a partial spirit."
        </p>
        <p>"Forget it, looks like even geniuses have their limits."</p>
        <p>"Haha…" Oliver laughed dryly.</p>
        <p>
          "I will leave then. You rest and join the others for training
          afterward. They have been training all this time, so make sure to
          catch up to them."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you elder for your patience." Oliver bowed and thanked Sigfor,
          no matter how grumpy the old elder was, he still waited and watched
          over for him patiently for five whole days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor waved his hand and left the room. He was tired too from
          continuously being on guard for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Damn, that's a lot of time. I should be more careful of spirit realms
          next time. The perception of time and distortion is not proportional
          to this," he mumbled to himself as he stared at his hand. The faint
          traces of abyssal energy still lingered, a reminder of the power and
          the cost.
        </p>

        <p>'Hmm…'</p>
        <p>
          For some reason, a sudden ominous feeling filled his heart. It was as
          if something bad was about to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly got out of the array and looked at the entrance of the
          mountain hall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The heavy doors loomed before him, casting long shadows in the dim
          light.
        </p>
        <p>His heart could not help but suddenly beat faster.</p>
        <p>'What is this bad feeling?'</p>
        <p>
          He frowned. The hall was wide open, with grass yards around on all
          three sides except the back, which led to another deeper space.
        </p>
        <p>
          This hall was basically the entrance to the mountain base.
          n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          But they were in the middle of nowhere at the moment, so why was he
          feeling this sinking feeling?
        </p>
        <p>He took a deep breath. The surroundings were eerily quiet.</p>
        <p>
          Even the usual chirping of birds and rustling of leaves seemed absent,
          adding to the sense of unease.
        </p>
        <p>
          He waited. A few minutes passed, but nothing happened. However, the
          feeling never left his chest. He went forward, nearing the entrance of
          the hall, which led to the outside.
        </p>

        <p>
          Stepping outside, he saw the familiar stone statues and a huge iron
          gate. Beyond that was vast and empty land covered in fog.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fog swirled lazily, obscuring the path and giving the area an
          otherworldly appearance.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is this feeling my imagination or what?' he pondered as he surveyed
          the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon finding nothing for the next few minutes, he exhaled and went
          back inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tension in his shoulders eased slightly, but the unease still
          lingered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever it was that he was feeling, they were safe inside this hall
          as long as Sigfor was with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although Alison was not present at the moment, Sigfor was a veteran
          exorcist himself, so he should be able to keep them safe in case they
          were in danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, how could someone be in this place? This place had an
          array of illusions surrounding it, and unless someone knew the direct
          route to the mountain, they would not be able to come to this place at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Most likely a stray beast or maybe a stray ghost.' Oliver thought
          about how it might be that.
        </p>
        <p>He shook his head, trying to dispel the lingering sense of dread.</p>
        <p>
          They could end up near this place by chance; it would not be
          surprising.
        </p>
        <p>For the time being, he returned to the dorm to rest.</p>

        <p>_____________</p>
        <p>In the upcoming few weeks, they trained harder than ever.</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor would have them spar with each other continuously, and
          sometimes he would take them all on himself at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Oliver might not have the advantage of a spirit, he was still
          capable of being their equal with his monstrous strength. This
          revelation hit some of them quite hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso, who had been thinking that he might finally get an edge over
          Oliver, was extremely disheartened when Oliver was able to maintain an
          upper hand throughout their spar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention hitting him once, Alphonso was not even able to touch
          him despite having his speed increased by the wind element and spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber was also not faring well. She could clearly feel the vast gap
          she had to cross if she desired to be at his level and make herself
          more recognizable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her frustration was evident, but it also fueled her determination to
          improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          She also got serious in her training. Slowly but surely, her thinking
          was also changing. Instead of relying on her tools, she was starting
          to be independent with her own power, using various weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          From gauntlets to great swords, she continued switching weapons,
          alternating between the two as she liked them the most so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her defense was pretty high compared to others, thanks to the earth
          element and her summoned spirit.
        </p>
        <p>Even Oliver had a hard time breaching her defenses.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia and Oliver were pretty much on equal terms now. While Oliver had
          a great advantage in strength, stamina, and speed, Nadia effectively
          used the ice element to counter his inhuman body powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          His water elemental attacks would instantly turn into ice the moment
          they reached her surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground around her would often be covered in a thin layer of frost,
          a signal to her growing control over her element.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most growth someone showed was none other than Evelyn. She was
          literally besting everyone else with her light attribute and spirit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was also starting to take her seriously. Both of them used
          katanas, but her skills with the katana were far better than his. Her
          strikes were fluid and precise, each one carrying the force of her
          intense training.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was also avoiding depending on his espera, all he was doing was
          using his strength only.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 166 &nbsp;Oliver vs. Daniel!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 166</p>
        <p>
          He had yet to get any rewards related to katanas or similar weapons,
          so he was using it as much as he knew about a rapier.
        </p>
        <p>He and she were fighting toe-to-toe.</p>
        <p>
          Next was Daniel, and Oliver had to admit that he was the best and most
          skilled with weapons. Despite not being on their level, he was able to
          contend with all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And with his thunder spirit, his speed and power were unparalleled
          now, even more so than Alphonso with his wind spirit!
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>Oliver blocked an incoming sword strike towards his chest.</p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          He pressed forward, pushing the sword away from him and attacking the
          opponent. His movements were swift and calculated, each strike
          delivered with precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was Daniel whom he was sparring with. The usual mischief on his
          face was replaced by a certain seriousness as he swung his weapon. The
          intensity in his eyes was unmistakable, a fierce determination driving
          his every move.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver could not help but secretly exclaim at the change on this guy's
          face. He rarely saw such an expression on his face.
        </p>
        <p>"You're wide open!"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel said as he swung the hilt of his sword at Oliver's blind spot,
          near his hip.
        </p>
        <p>"Ugh-!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver retreated. So far, only Daniel had ever managed to hit him,
          other than Bella and Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled, "You're indeed interesting. I rarely ever see you with such
          seriousness."
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel's expression did not falter as he readied his sword once again.
          He said, "Focus on the spar. I know you are holding back, and it is
          making me angry."
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes glinted fiercely, the grip on the sword in his hands
          tightening. The air around them seemed to vibrate with the intensity
          of their confrontation, each poised for the next move.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Give me your all. I don't care what happens next, I want it! I want
          to experience the strength of someone way above me in talent despite
          being my peer."
        </p>
        <p>
          He lunged forward, again aiming for Oliver's blind spot. However, this
          time, Oliver twisted his hand and parried the strike without even
          moving from his spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled wryly as he looked at Daniel's angry look. Daniel wanted him
          to give his all. How should he tell him that if he really went all
          out, he might not survive for even a second?
        </p>
        <p>
          That would truly break his spirit if he said that. He had been
          refraining from using espera or any artifact; all he was relying on
          was his brute strength.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Don't insult me!" Daniel roared as he saw him smiling wryly. He
          wildly swung his sword, wanting Oliver to be more serious with him.
          However, he was unable to hit him even once.
        </p>
        <p>
          It almost looked like the earlier hit he had given him was through a
          stroke of luck or Oliver's deliberate approach to get hit once.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes were slowly turning bloodshot. He really hated it when others
          underestimated him. It felt disrespectful to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gritting his teeth, his sword moved like a python, flexible and agile,
          wanting to strike the target, but the latter was just like a wall. No
          matter how or where he was hit, there was no effect!
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber, who was watching this duel from the side, could not help but
          clench the bottle of water in her hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's doing this again..." she whispered to herself in a strained
          voice.
        </p>
        <p>She could barely keep up with their movements using her eyes.</p>
        <p>
          But seeing Daniel's struggling expression, his bloodshot eyes, and his
          remarks, she felt a resonance with him.
        </p>
        <p>Was he feeling the same way as her?</p>
        <p>Was Oliver like this to others too?</p>
        <p>
          While he spoke to them normally and praised their abilities, his eyes
          never held even a flicker of interest or curiosity towards them and
          their abilities. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          She could see it, his lack of interest, that boredom whenever he
          sparred with them. He did not feel the same way as them.
        </p>

        <p>
          She considered herself a good judge of others' intentions. She knew
          she was just a kid and was getting ahead of herself by claiming to be
          experienced in such things, but she really was.
        </p>
        <p>
          At least she considered herself to be. However immature she may be to
          others, but to herself, she was someone who could tell how the other
          person was feeling towards her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if she was wrong, continuous interactions with Oliver and her
          keen observation of him and his eyes made her more sure about her
          conclusions.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had sparred with others too, but never once had she seen them make
          such an expression.
        </p>
        <p>She loathed this side of Oliver.</p>
        <p>"OLIVER!!"</p>
        <p>A voice yelled.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver paused as he looked ahead. Daniel was sweating profusely, his
          eyes were red, cheeks flushed as he panted.
        </p>
        <p>"GIVE ME YOUR BEST FOR ONCE!" he roared again.</p>
        <p>
          "If you are my friend, from this moment forth, you will give your
          all." Daniel gave the ultimatum, his tone was heavy as he poured out
          his emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He no longer cared. He considered Oliver his close pal; they had gone
          through a lot together. He wanted to be serious with him no matter
          what.
        </p>
        <p>
          He brought his sword close to his chest as he aligned the sword in a
          vertical pose. It looked as if he was going to use a sword art.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will now be using a sword technique I cherish. If you really
          consider me your friend, reply to me with your sword."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at this scene and sighed. He knew Daniel was not the
          type to care about anything. He only cared about swords, duels, and
          power. He was a simple-minded individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fine..." Oliver lowered his katana, his eyes turned serious, "Come at
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel, who saw this, could not help but smile. His grip on the sword
          turned stronger.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Finally.' His eyes focused as he recited the movements of the sword
          art he cherished
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 167 &nbsp;Using the most basic footwork!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 167</p>
        <p>He took a deep breath and exhaled.</p>
        <p>
          In the next instant, he moved, slowly at first, to his right but then
          back to his left.
        </p>
        <p>His movements were slow and easy to see.</p>
        <p>
          'A footwork?' Oliver narrowed his eyes as he saw Daniel moving in an
          unrecognizable pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver tightened his grip on his katana, readying himself for the next
          attack. The air between them grew thick with tension.
        </p>
        <p>
          He observed how his speed started to increase as he kept moving from
          one position to another.
        </p>
        <p>'Interesting…'</p>
        <p>
          Even with his enhanced senses, he was starting to get confused by
          Daniel's movements as Daniel sped up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he was not using his special eyes at the moment but normal
          vision.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon, it started to become harder and harder to keep up with his
          movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This technique is called [A Thousand Provisions]; it gives the
          opponent a taste of a thousand sword moves all instilled in a single
          strike," Daniel's voice came out as he moved faster and faster.
        </p>
        <p>"Get ready to have a taste of my favorite sword art."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes wavered slightly. The name of the technique sent a
          shiver of excite down his spine, but he remained focused, every muscle
          in his body taut with anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel circled around Oliver, who was watching closer than ever. His
          steps were unordered and weird as he ran in circles around him.
        </p>
        <p>'No… can't find the pattern at all.'</p>

        <p>
          Oliver had a thoughtful look on his face as he could not find a
          specific pattern in Daniel's movement to exploit an opening.
        </p>
        <p>'It won't work like that.'</p>
        <p>
          He calmed down, relaxing his posture. He straightened his slightly
          hunched back.
        </p>
        <p>
          A faint smile tugged at the corner of Oliver's lips, a rare show of
          confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel, who was waiting to find a spot to attack, narrowed his eyes as
          he saw the sudden relaxed posture Oliver had taken. He was a bit
          confused about what the latter was doing in such a critical moment.
        </p>
        <p>It was then he heard Oliver say something.</p>
        <p>"Do you know? I happen to have a footwork technique as well."</p>
        <p>Daniel's brows furrowed when he heard that.</p>
        <p>
          'So this guy had been hiding a footwork technique too. Just how much
          is he holding back!?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, on the other hand, looked at the running figure in circles as
          he took a stance as well.
        </p>
        <p>He was going to use a technique he had mastered a long time ago.</p>
        <p>
          While incomplete, he had enough mastery over it to make up for it at
          the moment—at least for this duel.
        </p>
        <p>
          The memories of countless hours of training flashed through Oliver's
          mind, grounding him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel's frown deepened when he saw Oliver moving in a familiar foot
          pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          '[Six Thoughtful Steps of the Spirits],' he was instantly able to
          recognize the familiar footwork given the number of techniques he had
          learned since he was able to walk.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why is he using that basic foot technique right now? Does he think he
          can best me with such a basic technique?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel observed deeply while maintaining his own movements and speed.
        </p>

        <p>
          'My technique is clearly superior, so why… why is his figure turning
          distant?' Daniel pondered as his heart raced.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world seemed to blur around Daniel as he struggled to keep his
          focus solely on Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          With every moment passing by, Oliver's figure turned into a blur until
          it finally vanished from the spot.
        </p>
        <p>'What!? Where did he go!?'</p>
        <p>
          He panicked, and his eyes darted around, trying to immediately search
          for him.
        </p>
        <p>'Where is he?'</p>
        <p>
          The moment he thought that, a familiar voice echoed in his ears from
          behind.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you looking for me?"</p>
        <p>Clang!!</p>
        <p>
          Daniel heard the voice and did not hesitate; he swung his sword down,
          a tremendous force behind that strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          He utilized all his power to execute the [Thousand Provisions]
          technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, contrary to his high expectations, what happened next shook
          him to the core.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver did not dodge it but blocked his strike with his katana.</p>
        <p>
          The impact reverberated through the air, the sheer force of it making
          the ground beneath them tremble, spewing dust cloud all over.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Crazy…" His voice leaked out subconsciously, impressed by what he
          saw.
        </p>
        <p>
          The force behind that strike was extraordinary. It specifically
          brought out his body's inner strength in that move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had to be at least thrice as strong as him physically to even
          dare to block that attack.
        </p>

        <p>'Just how strong are you…?'</p>
        <p>He looked into Oliver's calm eyes and felt his own eyes tremble.</p>
        <p>
          They were as calm as water and as deep as an ocean. At this moment,
          Oliver truly felt like a mountain stretching towards the heavens.
        </p>
        <p>'I have to surpass him.'</p>
        <p>
          However, even in the face of that realization, Daniel's resolve stood
          unshaken. He was going to do whatever it required to surpass that
          mountain reaching the heavens!
        </p>
        <p>
          "Arrrgh-!" Daniel groaned and forced himself as he swung down the
          sword again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time Oliver did not delay any longer but instead directly punched
          Daniel in the stomach.
        </p>
        <p>"Kuh-!"</p>
        <p>Daniel coughed hard as he was sent flying back.</p>
        <p>Bam!</p>
        <p>
          He crashed straight into the stone wall behind them before he fell
          down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had won. However, at this moment, he was looking down at his
          wrist; it was trembling hard.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze trailed up to the fallen boy who had caused this, and a smile
          appeared on his face.
        </p>
        <p>'Not bad.'</p>
        <p>
          He had never felt like this. At that moment, his heart felt excited as
          he took Daniel's sword attack.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a feeling he had not felt since he had fought with the pair of
          siblings back then.
        </p>
        <p>'He has a lot of potential.'</p>
        <p>Oliver made a note.</p>
        <p>
          'If he is allowed to grow stronger, he could become quite useful in
          fighting against demons in the future. Perhaps Evelyn might not have
          to suffer as much as she did alone?'
        </p>
        <p>
          An array of possibilities opened up in his mind as he imagined such a
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          But for that to happen, they would need to survive the perpetual
          plane. Only then would they have a chance.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 168 &nbsp;Daniel's enlightenment!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 168</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and went up to the guy fallen on the ground,
          breathing heavily.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was a great match," said Oliver as he extended his hand forward.
          "Here, take it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel chuckled painfully, "Fuck yes. It was the most awesome match I
          ever had."
        </p>
        <p>He took Oliver's hand as he got up with some difficulty.</p>
        <p>
          "You are crazy, dude." Daniel said as his smile broadened. "Never ever
          have I seen someone directly receive the strike from [Thousand
          Provisions] head on."
        </p>
        <p>"Is that so?" Oliver nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "You don't think? My father, who has mastered this technique, slayed
          ten thousand demons with one move of his using this same technique."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver shivered slightly as he imagined the full power of such a
          terrifying strike.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was really tempted to bind with Daniel however the system did not
          recognize him as a suitable target.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was highly likely due to the fact that Daniel had originally died
          in the perpetual plane.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe changing that future might change this situation too?</p>

        <p>
          If possible, he would really like to have a strong weapon technique
          from the Sacred Swords Clan, the master of weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, they had some of the best weapon techniques in the whole
          world.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver helped Daniel back to the chairs to rest.</p>
        <p>
          He could feel the others looking at him dazedly, he could only shake
          his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oliver, was that [Six Thoughtful Steps of Spirit]?" n/o/vel/b//in dot
          c//om
        </p>
        <p>Evelyn came to him and asked, she was curious.</p>
        <p>
          "I am curious about it too!" Daniel could not help but add, he was
          amazed how proficient Oliver
        </p>
        <p>"That footwork? That's right, it was that." he replied simply.</p>
        <p>
          "What!? How is that possible!? I also have learned that footwork, it's
          just a common and basic footwork, how can it be so powerful to match
          up with [Thousand Provisions] technique?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel almost would have stood up if he could but his body barely
          responded at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing his surprised face, Oliver pondered whether he should tell him
          how wrong he was about the footwork or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Six Thoughtful Steps of Spirit] was an incomplete footwork
          technique, the original footwork was extremely power, literally giving
          insane speeds to the individual.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, it was not a trash technique at all. But he still had to
          say something.
        </p>
        <p>He looked towards the eager Daniel and said in a serious tone.</p>

        <p>
          "Daniel," he started, "No technique in this world is weak, it's the
          user who is weak due to which the technique can not realize its full
          potential."
        </p>
        <p>
          "T-That's what my father said too!" Daniel stuttered as his eyes
          widened in disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>"So from now on, I am your dad."</p>
        <p>
          "Huh, what!?" Daniel asked as he could not just comprehend what was
          said.
        </p>
        <p>"Nothing." Oliver laughed and dismissed it.</p>
        <p>
          "But still, thanks to you, I have now realized my mistakes. Thank you
          very much, Oliver!" Daniel bowed deeply as he gave a heartfelt thanks.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm? What did you understand?" Oliver asked, curious that if Daniel
          had enlightenment, he might hear it as well, it might come in handy at
          some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No technique is inherently weak; it is we, the practitioner where the
          true fault actually lies within. I heard the same thing from my
          father, but I had forgotten about it, however, after hearing from you,
          I have now realized how important this was."
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel looked at his longsword as he said this while seemingly lost in
          deep thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As practitioners, it is our responsibility to master the technique to
          its full potential. If the technique seems weak, then it simply means
          that we are not looking at it correctly."
        </p>
        <p>
          'Umm? That's not what it should mean…" Oliver looked at him,
          speechless at how he had concluded this from his words.
        </p>
        <p>However, Daniel wasn't finished yet.</p>
        <p>
          "If we aren't able to bring out the technique's true potential, we
          simply need to improve the technique itself!" Daniel concluded in a
          resolute tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, that does sound like a great point, Daniel." Evelyn nodded in
          understanding.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I know, right? From now on, I will never forget any advice I hear
          from my father!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What a filial son!" Oliver patted his friend's shoulder and nodded.
        </p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          "Anyways, I'll go rest now. Alphonso, mind escorting him back to his
          room? I don't think he has any energy left to walk his way out,"
          Oliver turned to look at Alphonso, who was reading a thin booklet
          about runes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apparently, it was something he had been rewarded by Sigfor back then.
        </p>
        <p>"Sure, leave it to me."</p>
        <p>"Thanks, dude," Daniel thanked him from afar.</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso closed the book and stored it back into his storage ring and
          gave Daniel his shoulder, leaving the room with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey Nadia, how about we spar again? I really like your techniques and
          tactics!" Evelyn approached Nadia, who was sitting alone in a corner
          with an emotionless expression on her face.
        </p>
        <p>"…" Nadia glanced at her, contemplating.</p>
        <p>
          "Nadia, you should! Your control over the ice element is beautiful! I
          want to observe it again too," Amber joined them from behind,
          encouraging her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fine," Nadia said just one word before getting up and walking towards
          the stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sighed. Over the few days, he had tried his best to let other
          girls approach Nadia and become familiar with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She really deserved friends, and despite her cold demeanor, he
          believed that with the help of gradual interactions with others, she
          might change slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be honest, he could already see some changes. Earlier, she wouldn't
          talk with others for even a moment, but now she would at least reply
          to them and engage with them for a few moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it wasn't too big of an improvement, it was still better.
          Part of him also wanted to show his previous display of strength to
          motivate Nadia to work harder.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they were instructed by the clan elder, Nadia needed to establish
          her dominance over the other clan heirs, but her indifferent attitude
          made that naturally impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it was far better for her to make friends rather than make
          subordinates.
        </p>
        <p>
          He feared that if she was left alone, Nadia's mental state might turn
          into something worse.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 169 &nbsp;The Calm before Storm!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 169</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was worried that if she was left alone, Nadia's mental state
          might turn into something worse.
        </p>
        <p>Just the image of his mother, Ophelia, was enough to shake him.</p>
        <p>
          Ophelia had long abandoned her human psyche and had adopted an inhume
          mentality, as far as he knew.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not let a little girl like Nadia become something like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, preventing that from happening was still a far-fetched
          idea. He knew he wasn't capable enough to stop Ophelia from tampering
          with Nadia right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          But planting some seeds of humanity in her mind was still better than
          nothing. The future was unpredictable, after all.
        </p>
        <p>It changed continuously.</p>
        <p>__________</p>
        <p>
          He soon returned to his room and took out the potions he had stored in
          his mind space.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then started drinking them one by one to temper his espera and
          refine it further.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am almost out of potions now. Apart from a few healing potions, I
          don't have anything left," he thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had been continuously stocking his supplies by exchanging pills
          and potions with others in exchange for food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, his rations had long run out of stock, but thanks to
          Sigfor, he could sustain.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sigfor had told them to cook for themselves if they wanted to eat
          something, but since the old man didn't know how to cook despite being
          as old as a tree, he would eat with Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention the fact that he rarely felt hungry and didn't mind
          living without food, unlike them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had a functioning kitchen in his area along with the fresh
          ingredients Sigfor had brought to use or eat raw to be specific.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, Sigfor intended for them to consume raw fruits and
          vegetables to sate their hunger, however, how could the posh clan
          heirs be able to live such a life?
        </p>
        <p>
          They were used to delicate, full-course meals every day. There was no
          way that they could sustain a raw diet every day.
        </p>
        <p>
          But everyone knew that Oliver could cook, so no matter how it was, all
          the chores automatically fell to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus, he took on the role of being the group's cook—their personal
          chef.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, since he couldn't do it for free, he would charge them
          something in return for meals every day since they ate the food he
          would make.
        </p>
        <p>
          It worked well for some months, but now they were also running out of
          potions and pills to trade. After all, even if they might have stocked
          for themselves, who would have expected that it would be shared with
          Oliver in the end?
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything else that remained in their storage artifacts was too
          precious to be traded for mere food.
        </p>
        <p>
          So even Oliver was helpless and just cooked for them occasionally
          without asking anything in return. No matter how mature they thought
          and acted, in the end, they were still kids.
        </p>
        <p>Also, they were his friends, right?</p>
        <p>Right…?</p>
        <p>
          "Do I really consider them as my friends?" Oliver thought as he lay on
          his bed, staring at the wooden ceiling, lost in thought.
        </p>
        <p>
          He never really considered them as friends if he had to say it
          honestly, at most, he considered them as useful human resources that
          could help out humanity in the future war against demons.
        </p>

        <p>
          He helped Nadia in order for her to become stronger than she could as
          she was in the novel.
        </p>
        <p>So, was it right for him to call them his friends.</p>
        <p>"Haah… it's too complex, I will think about it later."</p>
        <p>
          He yawned and closed his eyes, he was going to sleep for some time.
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>
        <p>"We are ready, leader."</p>
        <p>"Have you located the barrier's weak spot?"</p>
        <p>"Yes, we have found it, and it should now be easy to infiltrate."</p>
        <p>"Well done."</p>
        <p>
          Outside, far from the mountain hall, stood a man dressed in
          pitch-black robes. He was standing idle, talking to his subordinates.
          He was none other than the leader of the heretic group who had come to
          retrieve the egg of the disaster beast.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was behind the group, preparing a killer array to engage Sigfor,
          whose presence he had faintly felt. To further confirm his suspicions
          about the expert inside the mountain hall, he had his subordinates
          check on it discreetly over the weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being so close to the barrier, there was no way any of them would miss
          sensing the presence of such an entity. They were all carrying stealth
          artifacts they had received from the sect—even a Rank-3 expert might
          not be able to sense their presence!
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright then, the moment I attack the barrier and draw out the
          experts, you will infiltrate the hall and get the egg of the disaster
          beast. Remember, either you succeed or don't come back," he said in a
          chilling voice. There was a momentary silence on the other side of the
          phone before a voice responded.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, leader!"</p>
        <p>
          He put the communicator down and looked in front of him. On the ground
          just next to his feet was a large runic array pulsing with a very dark
          aura. It was suffocating to look at, and all sorts of extremely
          complex runes were etched onto its surface. There was an occasional
          flash of bloody red light in the various runes, indicating its deadly
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          No doubt this was an extremely dangerous array. Just the amount of
          aura gathering near it was terrifyingly huge. Even he, who was as
          strong as a Rank-3 exorcist, had to wait for weeks to prepare the
          array and supply it with the necessary aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          "From my observations, the expert exorcist inside should also be
          Rank-3, but just in case, I prepared this array if they turn out to be
          more powerful than expected. As long as they are not a Rank-4
          exorcist, they will definitely be wounded badly," the man spoke
          sinisterly as his eyes gleamed with black aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was able to observe the massive barrier surrounding the whole
          mountain. "Whoever cast this barrier is definitely a high-level expert
          in array formations," he thought as he looked at the barrier deeply
          from outside.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 170 &nbsp;Heretics Attack!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 170</p>
        <p>
          'It might be someone from the Forging Association or one of the five
          major clans. Other than them, there's hardly anyone with such a level
          of barrier-making skills. It might be a talisman master.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The black-robed leader judged keenly as the array behind him pulsed
          more terribly. He took out a talisman from his pocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          The talisman was made out of black paper; it had something written on
          it with red ink, which was not really ink but blood!
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's time we claim what belongs to us. May there be eternal glory for
          demons!" His eyes turned maniacal as he incited the espera into
          action, activating the black talisman. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          The talisman trembled violently before an eerie espera leaked out from
          it like black ink from a fountain pen. The talisman vibrated and
          instantly headed toward the direction of the barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air around the leader seemed to shimmer with dark energy, his
          expression growing more twisted with anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the while, the leader's eyes did not waver as he looked at the
          flying talisman with sinister eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's been a while since I killed a high-ranking exorcist. My hands
          thirst for your potent blood," he said in a monotonic voice as he
          watched the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you kidding me, you old ma—I mean elder, I clearly scored the
          victory here!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel said disdainfully as he was declared the loser again. They had
          been gathered together and were playing chess; however, Sigfor had
          declared his move foul and directly eliminated him.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not only had Daniel moved his king piece despite it being under check,
          but he had also been trying to draw out a stalemate against his
          opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You brat! Today, I will teach you a lesson and correct your foul
          tongue!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor also rolled up his sleeves as he was ready to teach this
          cheating little brat a lesson for good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel clearly did not know how to play chess and yet dared to
          question him, who knew all the rules?
        </p>
        <p>"Ah, elder, please calm down. D-Daniel, quick! Apologize!"</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso tried to soothe things out as he panicked at the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Humph! What did I do wrong!? If a king can be stopped like this, then
          how is it still a king? It's so useless. You tell me, why is that?
          Also, isn't this pawn behind another pawn practically useless too?
          Always getting sacrificed for his comrade?"
        </p>
        <p>"Get aside, or else I will beat you too!"</p>
        <p>"No, please, elder! Calm your anger. Daniel is just ignorant!"</p>
        <p>
          "What!? Why am I being called ignorant!? Who even made this game?"
          Daniel frowned and pestered Alphonso.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was watching the drama unfold while chewing on a piece of
          apple. However, his expression was not too good. The bad feeling in
          his chest had intensified a lot, but he could not point it out.
          Everything was going so smoothly, so why was he feeling this way?
        </p>
        <p>
          The laughter and chatter around him felt distant, like an echo from
          another world, as his instincts screamed of impending danger.
        </p>

        <p>The girls were also watching with interest.</p>
        <p>"As I keep saying, you brats are—"</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor suddenly paused in the middle of what he was speaking. He
          turned his head abruptly in the direction of the mountain hall.
        </p>
        <p>His expression changed drastically.</p>
        <p>
          A terrifying aura emerged from his body, stunning everyone in the
          group.
        </p>
        <p>"Get back to your dorms. There's someone attacking the barrier."</p>
        <p>
          His extremely serious words rang in the ears of the shocked group.
        </p>
        <p>
          They watched with confused and shocked gazes as Sigfor disappeared
          from his spot after leaving them with his serious words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a moment ago, they were playing peacefully, and all of a sudden,
          he became serious and left.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver, who heard this, had a heavy frown on his forehead.</p>
        <p>'As I thought, that ominous feeling was not for nothing.'</p>
        <p>He knew it was serious just by looking at Sigfor's attitude.</p>

        <p>
          Not only that, he was also aware of how isolated this mountain was and
          how hidden they were from the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          For someone to locate this place and launch an attack, what did this
          mean?
        </p>
        <p>Even a child could understand the situation.</p>
        <p>
          But what was nagging him the most was the thought of who could be the
          attacker.
        </p>
        <p>
          For Sigfor to personally leave them alone and go outside to deal with
          it simply meant that the attacker was a dangerous element that could
          or held the means to bypass the strong barrier placed on the entire
          mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for someone to deliberately target the mountain with such a strong
          barrier at this time when Alison was away meant that they had planned
          this thoroughly.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is it a coincidence that the attack happened while we were here or…'
          Oliver thought deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Or is this a plot to eliminate the potential heirs of the five major
          clans at once?'
        </p>
        <p>Oliver's mind raced wildly as he considered many possibilities.</p>
        <p>
          'Did someone in the clan do this? Was there a traitor among the elders
          who gave away the information?' he thought with a frown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bad feeling inside his chest was his instincts warning him
          repeatedly of the danger. That only meant that this matter was not so
          simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why would someone attack from the front so openly if they wanted to
          assassinate us?'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Sigfor immediately went outside, then it could only mean they had
          done something huge that drew his attention to the extent that he was
          forced to leave personally rather than ensuring our safety first.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'And that's probably what the enemy wanted as well,' he thought
          deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          All his conclusions and deductions so far pointed to one thing only.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The enemies have already infiltrated inside through the barrier!'
        </p>
