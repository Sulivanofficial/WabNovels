        <h2>Chapter 121: Motivation to grow more! She must become strong!</h2>
        <p>It should have been an easy victory without a doubt.</p>
        <p>Oliver should not have stood a chance against her sister.</p>
        <p>
          To be honest, she was imagining a scenario similar to how Nadia's and
          Alphonso's match concluded.
        </p>
        <p>
          A one-sided victory where her sister would easily overpower him in a
          matter of seconds.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what happened next was contrary to her expectations. It was a
          scene that made her doubt herself and her training she had been
          undergoing so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          That guy called Oliver was easily able to keep up with her sister's
          every move!
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, as the fight progressed, she was able to notice how her
          sister was finding it difficult to even land a single blow on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was able to parry each and every move. It was almost as if he was
          predicting her mind and technique.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't believe that he had the knowledge of the secret martial
          arts techniques that they had been using from the Celestial Paradox
          Clan. That was impossible.
        </p>
        <p>After all, it was one of the heavily guarded secrets of the clan.</p>
        <p>
          So, he was actually able to decipher her moves in that fight alone, in
          that short period of time.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although he was dodging or parrying by a hair's breadth, it was
          extraordinarily impressive to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her sister, whom she could never stop despite knowing about the
          martial techniques, was being countered by an unknown guy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could not even believe it after seeing the fight with her own
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't know when, but her hands subconsciously curled into fists.
          She was finding it hard to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secretly, she was hoping that her sister could at least land a single
          blow on the guy who was so flexible he could dodge everything thrown
          at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted her sister to at least land one attack on him, but why?
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it because she would feel bad that her sister, who was a genius,
          was losing to this guy?
        </p>
        <p>Or…</p>
        <p>Was it for her own self-assurance?</p>
        <p>
          Was it because she did not want to accept that someone of the same age
          as her could be on par with her sister while she could not?
        </p>
        <p>Was it to satisfy her pride?</p>
        <p>
          Would she feel that her achievements up to this point in life would
          not be worth it and she was a frog at the bottom of a well?
        </p>
        <p>She didn't want to accept it, did she? Her ineptitude, that was.</p>

        <p>
          She would feel good if Oliver got defeated easily just like she would
          when matched against Bella, would she not?
        </p>
        <p>
          She could lie to herself then, saying, 'Look! Even the heirs from
          other great clans could not stand up to her sister! How could she,
          then?'
        </p>
        <p>
          But as she kept watching the fight go on and on, and seeing the
          expression of struggle in her sister's eyes and Oliver's calm demeanor
          as if he was not bothered in the slightest by the fight, something
          awakened within her.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guy was strong. Either stronger than her sister or on the same
          level as her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt a strong surge of emotion at this realization. Biting her
          lip, she pondered what she had been doing so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why was she not able to stand on equal grounds with her sister? She
          herself knew best that she did not lack talent, resources, or
          anything.
        </p>
        <p>Was it because she was slacking off?</p>
        <p>If so, then why were her dreams so big?</p>
        <p>
          Did she not want to provide a comfortable life to others? How could
          she do that if she slacked off? It would be better to not dream this
          big when she was not able to put in the effort required for it.
        </p>
        <p>She experienced all sorts of emotions in that moment.</p>
        <p>Grief, for being like this.</p>
        <p>Envy, for Oliver's calmness and strength.</p>
        <p>
          Anger, at herself for being so pitiful to even think about dragging
          others down instead of moving up herself. For harboring such a toxic
          mindset.
        </p>

        <p>And… some joy?</p>
        <p>
          Joy? She felt some sort of happiness as well… why? Was it because she
          realized this when she still had the time to change herself?
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt a newfound relief. She was relieved that she was able to
          understand this in time and have the opportunity to further correct
          herself in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          To strive for more in the future, to not think about dragging others
          down to her level just because she could not reach their level.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wondered what this guy, who was currently fighting, would have
          done if he was in her shoes?
        </p>
        <p>
          Would he have also thought about wanting to put others down to satisfy
          his ego? Would he have also harbored this toxic mindset like her if he
          was in her situation? Or would he have never borne such thoughts in
          the first place?
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe he might have gotten more motivated instead of feeling down?
        </p>
        <p>
          She was curious to know, but alas it was not something that she could
          know just because she wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a small duel between her sister and this guy from the Mystic
          Purge Clan was able to leave her with such insights.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at their fight in a new light, she wondered if the reason that
          this clicked within her was because of Oliver's strength?
        </p>
        <p>Why did she think so?</p>
        <p>
          Maybe it was because no matter how much she desperately wished for him
          to get hit even once, he did not.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if there was a wide gap between her and his level that could
          not be breached just because she wished for it to crack.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was because no matter how much losers try to wish, curse, or hope,
          a genius would not even notice them and keep reaching higher and
          higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it would get to the point where the loser would either become numb
          to the success of the genius, accept the reality, and give up, or
          become influenced by the genius, trying to follow the same path.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe she did become numb when, despite her hopes, Oliver managed to
          counter her sister's every move repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her sister was her role model, but despite seeing her struggle, she
          did not feel as bad as she thought she would before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now she felt a surging flame glowing inside her, becoming brighter and
          brighter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unknowingly, Oliver had established a place in her mind, serving as a
          goal that she must obtain!
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 122: He will climb the highest!</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 122</h2>
        <p>
          Her sister was her role model, but despite seeing her struggle, she
          did not feel as bad as she thought she would before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now she felt a blazing flame glowing inside her, becoming brighter and
          brighter, making her more motivated.
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched intently, wanting to obtain more insight from their fight
          if possible.
        </p>
        <p>However, the fight did not last as long as others had expected.</p>
        <p>
          There were clouds of dust everywhere due to the commotion from before,
          and the moment they peered into it after the dust clouds settled, they
          saw a shocking view. It was too sudden.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was lying with his back against a tree, clutching his chest and
          groaning in pain.
        </p>
        <p>What happened? How did he lose?</p>
        <p>
          All they heard was a strong bang, and the next moment Oliver was lying
          down, defeated.
        </p>
        <p>Did Bella finally win?</p>
        <p>
          She looked at her sister and noticed her eyes had a trace of surprise
          as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt it was understandable that Bella won. Her sister was the
          oldest of the bunch and equally talented; her losing to someone with
          less experience and training would be hard to believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what transpired next made her perception of her sister crumble.
        </p>
        <p>
          She, who boasted that she knew her sister the best, was now
          dumbfounded by the scene unfolding before her eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Bella, her sister, who had always been calm and composed even in the
          toughest situations, no matter how high the pressure, lost her
          composure for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched as her sister went up to the guy and grabbed his collar
          roughly.
        </p>
        <p>So disrespectful!</p>
        <p>
          She could not help but look at her older sister in shock. What was she
          doing in front of so many people and elders?
        </p>
        <p>And why was she doing this?</p>
        <p>She heard her sister yelling at the guy.</p>
        <p>Purposefully? Intentionally?</p>
        <p>
          She heard those words but couldn't hear the full sentence from afar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes widened even further when her sister tried to forcefully stop
          his hand from clutching his injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          She hurriedly went up to her to stop her since the elders were not
          intervening for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>However, before she could, someone else reached him first.</p>
        <p>It was Nadia! His sister.</p>
        <p>
          She could feel a very heavy tension filling the atmosphere at that
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her heart palpitated in anxiety when she heard Nadia's cold threat.
          She could feel the air around them was filled with a strong and dark
          intent solely aimed at her sister.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smell of gunpowder was evident in the situation, and even the
          slightest action could lead to an explosion.
        </p>

        <p>
          She could feel the strong aura oozing out of Nadia; it was
          overwhelming, on par with her sister's aura.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia was definitely angry, and she had the right to be.</p>
        <p>
          Her sister was being too much at the moment, tormenting her opponent
          even after winning.
        </p>
        <p>This was confusing given her sister's nature.</p>
        <p>
          Even though she had not seen it with her own eyes, she put the matter
          behind her mind and quickly stopped her sister from acting further.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could see a hint of madness in Bella's eyes, as if she was
          unwilling to accept the outcome.
        </p>
        <p>
          She made a mental note to herself to later question her about it and
          the duel.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a small incident where her sister almost cried, the event was
          quickly wrapped up.
        </p>
        <p>
          After reaching back home, back to their clan, she tried asking her
          sister on multiple occasions about the outcome of the duel and what
          she was unwilling about, but all those times, her sister either
          avoided the topic or did not reply to her.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if she did not want to talk about it at all.</p>
        <p>
          All she heard from her was that there would be more opportunities in
          the future and that she should be more patient.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it was now when they were meeting again at the base of the
          mountain shortly after a few days.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elders had left them behind to train under the guidance of a
          renowned exorcist, a veteran of war.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, to meet their new teacher, they were supposed to climb up a
          mountain where the higher they climbed, the more pressure it would put
          on their shoulders to test them if they were worthy enough to reach
          the top.
        </p>
        <p>It was, in a way, tempering their bodies and will with each step.</p>

        <p>At the top was where their teacher awaited them.</p>
        <p>
          Who knows, he might even be monitoring them right as they were
          climbing slowly, ensuring their safety and assessing their skills and
          standings.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was able to surpass most of the heirs from other clans, except for
          the ones from the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter how hard she tried to reach up to him, he would maintain a
          fixed distance between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if he was 'deliberately' doing this, trying to challenge her
          or show her who was superior with how easily he was keeping the
          distance fixed between them.
        </p>
        <p>If she moved up two stairs, then so would he.</p>
        <p>
          It should have been difficult for him too as he climbed upwards since
          each stair had an increased amount of pressure, but he was still able
          to maintain the gap.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, instead of feeling down or angry this time, she was feeling
          more excited and motivated as she climbed more and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her sister and his sister, Bella and Nadia, were competing among
          themselves at the top. They were quite far from them at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>She wondered if all the older sisters were like this.</p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, she could not help but secretly feel that the guy whose
          back was facing her was a milestone that she must reach and surpass.
        </p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver, who had been jogging up without knowing anything, could have
          never expected that Evelyn was thinking this much.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, if he was asked, he would say that this matter was not that
          deep.
        </p>
        <p>At least not to him.</p>
        <p>
          'For some reason, I am feeling a strong gaze on my back for a while…'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sweated slightly as he kept walking upwards. He could guess who
          was behind this intense stare.
        </p>
        <p>He was slightly confused as to why she was looking at him.</p>
        <p>Is she mad that he was ahead of her?</p>
        <p>Well, it could not be helped.</p>
        <p>He was planning to surpass all of them at the moment.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 123: Overtaking everyone! No help given?</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 123</h2>
        <p>A few hours later</p>
        <p>"Pant… Pant…"</p>
        <p>
          Evelyn was heavily panting, her cheeks flushed red as beads of sweat
          rolled down her forehead, drenching her youthful face.
        </p>
        <p>She staggered and almost fell on the stair she was currently on.</p>
        <p>
          It had been hours since then, and they had all climbed quite far and
          high by now.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not sure where they were right now, but they had climbed a
          considerable distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been a long time since she had been using her espera to
          strengthen her body internally to help counter the increasing
          pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this moment, the pressure on her shoulders was at least ten times
          stronger than it was initially. It was extremely difficult for her to
          even take another step upwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew that if she fell now, she would lose all her strength and
          would not be able to climb any higher.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glancing back, she could see almost all of them had broken down in
          exhaustion on their respective steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso, Daniel, Amber… all of them had stopped climbing further and
          were lying weakly on their respective stairs, not moving an inch.
        </p>
        <p>
          She gritted her teeth and thought, 'I cannot move more… I feel like
          falling down.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The help that Elder Sigfor had promised at the beginning of the climb
          was not here. She could not help but feel a bit concerned for them.
          The pressure was still pressing onto them, rendering them unable to
          move up or down.
        </p>
        <p>
          'No, they should be fine. This is not a trial of death. I am sure they
          will intervene if things become excessive for any of them.'
        </p>

        <p>She calmed down as she thought about this and looked upwards.</p>
        <p>Her eyes narrowed as she tried to see the figures above.</p>
        <p>
          The figures of her sister and Naida were now visible to her clearly.
          Their speed had slowed down significantly, and they were taking one
          step at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear from their posture that the pressure above was becoming
          harder for them.
        </p>
        <p>However, a lone figure was still climbing non-stop…</p>
        <p>
          Her heart fiercely started to beat in excitement as she watched him
          reach close to the two girls who were above.
        </p>
        <p>Tap Tap Tap</p>
        <p>
          He was climbing up like there was no pressure on him, moving up as if
          he was climbing a casual stairway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, she saw him pass the two girls who were equally surprised as
          she was when they saw him overtaking them.
        </p>
        <p>Evelyn smiled, gritted her teeth, and took another step.</p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          The pressure on her shoulders increased significantly, and she could
          not help but sit down.
        </p>
        <p>'So this is my limit currently…'</p>
        <p>
          She thought to herself as she felt the dense pressure. Even using
          espera was now becoming tougher. A sense of suffocation was evident in
          the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          She leaned against a rock and watched as Nadia also paused at one
          point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, she was followed by Bella, who was just a few steps above
          her and fell down on that step as well.
        </p>
        <p>But…</p>

        <p>Oliver… He was still moving upwards.</p>
        <p>She could not believe how this guy was doing it.</p>
        <p>Was the pressure not affecting him at all?</p>
        <p>
          Even if it was, he did not seem to be affected much by it for some
          reason.
        </p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver kept moving upwards, one stair after another. He went on
          non-stop. He could feel the immense pressure descending on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was using his turbulent espera to reinforce his body and move
          upwards. Coupled with his super strength and on top of that, the
          reinforcement from espera, he was able to keep climbing non-stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the pressure was overbearing, there was a strange sensation in
          his body as he kept moving upwards, his espera although subtly was
          becoming more concentrated. This was probably due to the gravitational
          force pressing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          He noticed Bella and Nadia on his way but still kept moving upwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being the person with tenfold the talent of someone like Nadia, he was
          naturally able to overtake them.
        </p>
        <p>He wanted to know what his limit was compared to others.</p>
        <p>
          It was fine if they were suspicious of his strength. He was here to
          train, so they might as well see his true strength later.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not like they would become jealous and try to kill him as soon
          as possible to eliminate some growing threat. Although they were not
          developed deeply in the novel, he knew they did not have that sort of
          personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not like he could do much about it, considering he was about to
          spend months or maybe even years with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was better to be like this if they were supposed to be working
          together as a team in the future at some point.
        </p>
        <p>As he kept stepping up, his legs started to wobble slowly.</p>

        <p>
          "This is…" he panted slightly as he strained himself, "…getting
          tough."
        </p>
        <p>
          He could still spot the mountain top through the fog and knew that it
          was still far from their location. In fact, he was not even close to
          covering half the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          The track of time was now blurry to everyone; he did not know how much
          time had passed since the start of all this.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been taking breaks from time to time while climbing; however,
          for the past few hours, he had been going up non-stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that if he dared to rest for a moment, his body would truly
          fall down, and he would not be able to continue any longer—both
          mentally and physically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back, he could not help but narrow his eyes, and now even the
          figures of Nadia and Bella were distant from where he was. Had it not
          been for his extraordinary senses and their relative distance, he
          might have not been able to see their shadows at all either.
        </p>
        <p>'It seems this is as far as I go?'</p>
        <p>
          He thought to himself internally, wondering how strong he would have
          to be to even close half the distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, he decided to climb one more step, a last step, and then
          stop. That was as far as he could muster up his will.
        </p>
        <p>Click!</p>
        <p>
          He placed his foot on the next stair and instantly felt an even
          stronger pressure than before raining down on him, threatening him to
          stop climbing. The sound of rocky stairs grinding against his feet was
          as clear as day in his ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          He persisted, slowly climbed over, and instantly crashed to the
          ground. He reacted in time and quickly leaned against the rock to
          prevent any damage to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had reached his limit too. He sighed as he looked at the dense
          white fog surrounding him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not keep using [Cosmic Void Gaze]; they were extremely
          draining. Not to mention, he was already mentally exhausted—unable to
          even try using it.
        </p>
        <p>All he could see was white fog filling his vision.</p>
        <p>"Now, who will get us out of here?"</p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>"Hey! Is anyone there!?"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel yelled at the white fog around him. He had been here for some
          significant amount of time now.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could no longer spot Nadia, Oliver, Evelyn, Bella at all. It was
          either that they had gone way above, or the fog had become dense with
          time.
        </p>
        <p>"Ugh! I am getting annoyed by all this!"</p>
        <p>Suddenly, another voice came out, resonating in his ears.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 124: Dennis? What happened?</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 124</h2>
        <p>"Ugh! I am getting annoyed by all this!"</p>
        <p>
          He heard a feminine shout and focused on a shadow just a few steps
          above him. He was sure that it was Amber's vague figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed she was also getting frustrated at being stuck like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey, Amber!" Daniel shouted in her direction, "Are you there? It's
          me, Daniel!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Daniel, is that you? The fog seems to be getting thicker and
          thicker!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I noticed it too. Maybe it's about time that someone picks us up from
          here!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do hope that your guess is right and someone really comes to our
          aid, or I am going to go crazy here!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel chuckled despite the tension, "Hang in there, Amber. Just a bit
          longer."
        </p>
        <p>
          At that moment, they suddenly heard a sweet feminine voice echoing
          around them. It was neither too loud nor too soft, just right.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well done, kids. You all have managed to climb so far. Be proud of
          being born into your clans and having such prestigious blood running
          through you."
        </p>
        <p>The arrogance in the woman's tone was hidden but still present.</p>
        <p>
          "Now that all of you have reached your limit, it is time to start your
          real training. Don't be disheartened for not reaching the top. You
          will have plenty of opportunities in the future."
        </p>
        <p>The children listened attentively to her words.</p>

        <p>
          They did not miss when she said 'all of you.' Being born with
          intelligence, they could tell that all their fellow mates had finally
          stopped climbing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ones at the bottom could not help but wonder how much they had
          climbed so far, given the hours of difference between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as they were thinking about it, they all felt their bodies
          becoming lighter as the scene in front of them blurred and shifted
          into something else entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of the dense white fog, they were now facing a tall building
          built like a traditional Japanese house.
        </p>
        <p>
          The roof of the house was steeply pitched and curvy, with deep eaves
          extending far to provide shade and protection from the elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          They noticed that the windows were made of wooden frames filled with
          translucent paper, allowing diffused light to enter the rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the house was mainly constructed using wood and looked
          beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel whistled in awe, "This place is straight out of a storybook."
        </p>
        <p>
          They were quite high up in the altitude, the blue sky above them was
          beautiful and behind them as far as they could see was the same white
          mist or clouds, they were definitely at the mountain peak.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was also looking at the traditional house in front of him with
          keen eyes before looking beside him. He had just finished drinking a
          vitality potion to restore his espera and stamina.
        </p>
        <p>All the others who had joined were also there just next to him.</p>
        <p>
          However, what caught everybody's attention was not the massive mansion
          but the stunning woman standing before them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman gave the impression of a proud lion. She had slitted black
          eyes. Her thick, curvy, medium-length hair was the color of charcoal,
          styled in an exquisite way that was not practical for everyday
          activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had a curvy build with the charm of a mature woman, and her skin
          was brown and tanned.
        </p>
        <p>
          With thin eyebrows, upturned eyes, and full lips, her face was devoid
          of blemishes.
        </p>

        <p>
          She was wearing a dress with a combination of purple and blue colors.
          Overall, from her youthful appearance and voice, she didn't seem older
          than 30 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, her dense aura was unmistakable and revealed her hidden depth
          and age. She was much older than she appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am Alisa, Alisa Velez. Your newly appointed teacher. I will be
          responsible for training you all during your stay here and ensuring
          you all grow into something much better than your current selves."
        </p>
        <p>
          She spoke in an enthusiastic voice, addressing all those present,
          mainly the children.
        </p>
        <p>There was a brief, stunned silence before Alphonso broke it.</p>
        <p>"What? You are the teacher?"</p>
        <p>Alphonso muttered, seemingly confused by this.</p>
        <p>Alisa frowned, "What? Do you have a problem—"</p>
        <p>
          "The heck!? Was our teacher not supposed to be a man?" Daniel's
          confusion quickly turned into incredulity. "A veteran exorcist from
          battlefields? I was told that he was the most masculine man ever. I
          was so excited to meet him! What is a jade beauty doing here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel exclaimed unintentionally, interrupting the woman. He was
          probably so shocked that he let out his thoughts aloud for everyone to
          hear, forgetting that he was not alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The children around him exchanged nervous glances, sensing the tension
          rising. After all, he sounded disrespectful...
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe climbing and waiting on the mountain had taken a toll on his
          brain, making him restless.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Damn! Where is Sir Dennis? Is this another joke!? I am seriously not
          in the mood right now—Pfft!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Before he could complete his sentence, he was flung backward by a
          sudden burst of terrifying aura emanating from the woman called Alisa.
        </p>
        <p>"Did I allow you to speak? How dare you interrupt me…"</p>

        <p>
          A frown was etched on her forehead, and there was a hint of anger in
          her eyes. Her long hair fluttered behind her with the sudden gust of
          wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A man, you say… huh? Sir Dennis? Dennis Rivera, if I am not wrong…"
        </p>
        <p>She whispered in a tone that carried hatred.</p>
        <p>
          The pressure around her multiplied significantly as all the children
          present had their expressions change.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt his knees buckle slightly, the weight of her aura pressing
          down on him like an unseen hand.
        </p>
        <p>'Ugh-!'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her. The pressure was as heavy as what he faced on
          the mountain. It was as if someone was trying to press him to the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>Bam!</p>
        <p>
          He heard a noise and saw Alphonso collapse under the pressure, unable
          to withstand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber was gritting her teeth, trying to endure it with all her might.
          Her hand was holding a gem ball that pulsed with light from time to
          time. He was sure it was an artifact she was using to support herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver closed his eyes and took a deep breath. He had to do something,
          or they might all collapse.
        </p>
        <p>"M-Miss Alisa, may I know why you are angry?"</p>
        <p>
          He said and instantly regretted it. The woman paused and looked at
          him. Suddenly, all the pressure disappeared from the atmosphere as if
          it was never there.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the next instant, all of it was directly focused on him as
          she stared at him intently.
        </p>
        <p>"Why, you ask?"</p>
        <p>"The name 'Dennis Rivera.' Whom did you hear it from?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver had a dark expression at the moment. The pressure on him was
          terrifyingly huge, far greater than what he felt on the mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I heard it from the clan elder," he said, his voice steady despite
          the weight pressing down on him. "Why does that name anger you so
          much?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the woman with a frown. Why was she venting her anger on
          him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Even so, if he bent down here, what respect would he have left? His
          mind raced as he sorted out the ways to stop this pressure bearing
          down on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He moved his head and looked directly at the woman who was the source
          of all this.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 125: He fell off the mountain!?</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 125</h2>
        <p>
          Now that his espera had recovered, he didn't hesitate to use it again
          to fortify himself instantly against the pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman showed a hint of surprise; through her senses, she could
          tell that this boy did not have this much espera when she was
          assessing them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But now, all of a sudden, more and more espera was flowing out from
          his body like a smooth waterfall. Where was this espera from then if
          not from him?
        </p>
        <p>
          Did she make a mistake when analyzing them? The chances of that
          happening were slim but not zero.
        </p>
        <p>
          And for some strange reason, she felt that she could not properly
          analyze this little kid. Either he had an artifact strong enough to
          counter her, or something else...
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, the pressure that was directed towards him was quite a
          lot for his level, and he was doing fine against it.
        </p>
        <p>
          While she was angry, there was a part of her mind that was shocked by
          his resilience.
        </p>
        <p>'Hmm...?'</p>
        <p>She narrowed her eyes when she saw him looking at her.</p>
        <p>Shiver!</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a cold chill went up her spine as she instinctively put her
          hand in front of her, preparing to block an incoming strike.
        </p>

        <p>However, the anticipated strike did not come.</p>
        <p>
          She was sure that just now she felt that he was going to attack her
          with something deadly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could feel it in her guts; just a moment ago when she looked into
          his eyes, something definitely happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was an instinct. She was a veteran who had lived close to death
          during her prime days on the battlefield.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no doubt about it. If she dared to instinctively block an
          intent directed by him towards her, then it was unmistakably something
          dreadful.
        </p>
        <p>To make her be on guard against him?</p>
        <p>He, who was barely a Rank-1 exorcist?</p>
        <p>
          If she told someone that a Rank-1 exorcist was able to make her be on
          her guard, her colleagues and friends would never believe her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She let out an amused smirk, as the previous anger slowly dissipated,
          and so did the pressure that was being exerted on Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver felt relieved that the pressure was now gone.</p>
        <p>
          He was really pissed off at her for suddenly targeting him when he did
          not even do anything to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only thing he did was to defuse the situation before tensions
          escalated.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just now he had to use suppressed [Enshrouding of Death] on her to
          bring her back to her senses.
        </p>

        <p>What sort of teacher was she!?</p>
        <p>
          If she was able to lose her temper over a verbal thing, then she was
          not sane at all.
        </p>
        <p>Leaving children like them with her was madness.</p>
        <p>
          Looking at the angry expression Oliver was making, Alisa could not
          help but laugh.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now, now, I apologize for my outburst. It was childish of me to
          behave as such with mere children. I am sure you guys are the clueless
          bunch here," she softly smiled at him as she added, "In fact, it
          should be those bunch of old men who instigated this whole thing now
          that I think about it… My gosh, such scheming people to use children
          as bait just to get at me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And here I was thinking why they left so suddenly without meeting me
          personally. I thought at that time they might have clan duties, but
          now I am sure why they were in a hurry to leave... or escape?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver heard this but still did not feel any better. It could not
          change that she did behave rudely with him alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps sensing his emotions and train of thought, she said, "Alright,
          don't be like that. I did apologize already, no? I will give you a
          gift, so let's forget about it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing her mention 'gift' made his ears perk up. Well, if the gift
          was worth it, then he was willing to let it off.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are not joking, are you?" he looked at her suspiciously. Despite
          being old, Oliver never had a decent experience with aged people of
          this world. One might think you mature as you age, but all the old
          people were behaving this way.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Of course, I never go back on my words," she trailed off as she
          looked at his suspicious stare, "You... don't believe my words, do
          you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not say anything and just went back. He would see if she
          would keep her word in the future or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Miss Alison, well, but what happened? Why were you so angry just
          now?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Bella asked in a curious and alert tone. Just now, they were almost
          crushed by her pressure alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison's face twitched for a second before she shook her head, "Forget
          it, it's a long story. I will tell you some other time. For now, we
          should proceed further."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh..." Bella didn't pursue the matter anymore. She could see Alison
          was uncomfortable with this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, let's start from the beginning. From now on, I will be your
          teacher, so refer to me as such, or you can call me 'Master' too, just
          like Sigfor if you want." Alison went back to her composed expression
          as she continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          "While you were all climbing, I made some analysis by observing you
          lot and will devise different training plans for each one of you. Not
          only that, I have recorded the steps you have climbed."
        </p>
        <p>
          She clapped her hands, and a blackboard emerged out of nowhere and
          started floating to her right.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was probably retrieved from her storage artifact that she might
          have been carrying on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the blackboard, there was something written in bold and big words.
        </p>
        <p>It was a leaderboard of sorts, written by her.</p>
        <p>"This here is the leaderboard that I made, your future—"</p>
        <p>
          "Excuse me, Miss Alison!" Alphonso suddenly interrupted by raising his
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What is it?" she frowned in displeasure at being interrupted once
          again.
        </p>
        <p>Once again?</p>
        <p>
          "Umm, well, the thing is Daniel is still not here after you 'pushed'
          him out some time ago..."
        </p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>
          It was only then that others also realized that they had continued
          without Daniel.
        </p>
        <p>It's true. He was still not here.</p>
        <p>It couldn't be that she threw him off the mountain, right?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 126: Leaderboard! Who's at the top!?</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 126</h2>
        <p>
          Alison did not notice the bewildered expressions on their faces and
          disappeared from her spot, only to reappear a moment later with a boy
          having messy hair and fog leaving his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was Daniel, and he was unconscious, perhaps from the impact earlier
          that sent him out.
        </p>
        <p>
          A vial appeared in Alison's hand carrying a strawberry-red liquid as
          she slowly poured the contents into Daniel's mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cough…" he slowly woke up and looked around in confusion before
          looking at the person holding him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His face paled as he looked at her with a look of horror. Just now,
          when he was thrown back by her, he landed among some strange vines
          that bit him in multiple places, making his vision blurry and his
          surroundings strange, and after that, he blacked out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only now did he wake up and realize those vines were definitely
          poisonous.
        </p>
        <p>This was a terrifying woman… he didn't want to be held by her.</p>
        <p>
          "Hey there, it's my fault for earlier, haha. I will give you a gift
          too… let's pretend nothing happened."
        </p>
        <p>
          She put him down and patted his back as if nothing had happened, then
          took him to stand beside the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time, he was subdued and did not speak much for fear of offending
          this woman again.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for having a masculine teacher with big and strong muscles? He put
          that matter aside for now.
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>"So, here's the ranking leaderboard!"</p>

        <p>[Ranking board:</p>
        <p>[1st: White-haired kid — 8438 steps]</p>
        <p>[2nd: Girl with platinum hair — 6975 steps]</p>
        <p>[3rd: Girl with no expressions — 6897 steps]</p>
        <p>[4th: Golden-haired girl — 5493 steps]</p>
        <p>[5th: Tool-using girl — 3482 steps]</p>

        <p>[7th: Weak-looking kid — 2987 steps]</p>
        <p>_____________</p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          They looked at the peculiar nicknames they had been assigned by their
          new 'teacher' and could not help but have blank expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh? What's with the look? Did you not understand something this
          simple?" she looked at them confusedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Miss Alison, I demand that you change my name!" Alphonso raised his
          hand again and complained, "Why am I the only one written with such a
          demeaning name?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's because you were the last and weakest of the bunch. I don't
          know your names either. So on that note, start introducing yourselves
          one by one."
        </p>
        <p>
          The others remained silent unlike him, their eyes were fixated on the
          first rank, that was now assigned to Oliver, all of them had a strong
          expression in their eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Especially Bella, whose eyes were burning with determination and
          spirit, she was burning this sight in her memory, she could not
          believe that there was such wide gap between her and him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was younger than her and despite this was able to cross her with
          such a huge gap, she was really unwilling. She remembered the scene of
          her duel with him and how effortlessly he had dodged each one of her
          strikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was definitely a guy with many secrets, she was equally curious
          about what was he hiding and how strong was he actually, his powers,
          his espera, his rank as an exorcist, she wanted to know them and
          compare.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I will defeat you sooner or later…' she thought with an intense glint
          passing through her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver suddenly felt goosebumps crawling all over his skin as he
          looked around.
        </p>
        <p>He noticed Nadia staring at him with her usual cold eyes.</p>
        <p>
          He could guess that she was probably wondering how he managed to
          overtake her by such a margin.
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled wryly, this result made him aware of his current standing.
          It was neither good nor bad. Decent at most in his opinion. He felt he
          could do more if he used Abyss energy as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such was the case with Daniel and Amber as well, despite getting
          thrown off, he still felt that Oliver was indeed a worthy opponent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, it was definitely a surprise for him, he had expected
          Bella to top the rankings considering how she defeated Oliver in their
          duel but it was opposite now.
        </p>
        <p>
          He clutched the handle of his sword hard, he would really like to test
          Oliver's sword skills too and see if he was better than him in that
          aspect or not.
        </p>
        <p>If he was, then…</p>
        <p>An unreadable glint flashed past his dark eyes.</p>
        <p>
          Amber, on the other hand, was also looking at the board with narrowed
          eyes. She had expected this result.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's right, to her this was not an unexpected result unlike others
          who were predicting Bella to rank at top.
        </p>

        <p>
          While others might not have thought or noticed, she did see it during
          his fight with Bella, her entire focus was on Oliver—more specifically
          his nonchalant expression during the whole fight.
        </p>
        <p>It did not look to her that he was struggling a bit at all.</p>
        <p>
          If anything, he had a calculating look in his eyes at that time, she
          had seen that sort of look many times so she was familiar with it. It
          was a look she often had when analyzing her tools or artifacts,
          determining their structure or use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps this was also why she had been more interested in talking with
          him since the beginning. She could feel that he and her were similar
          to some degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso wanted to argue more but could not. He remembered what
          happened to Daniel and shut his mouth. He was having a hard time
          swallowing such humiliation for the first time ever. If he spoke more
          then he would only look like a loser having hard time accepting his
          position.
        </p>
        <p>
          After everyone introduced themselves, the teacher nodded and pointed
          towards the house in the back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Since all of you are tired now, I will start the proper training from
          tomorrow. For now, all of you can choose a room on the first floor for
          yourself."
        </p>
        <p>
          "As for Oliver and Daniel, I will prepare gifts for you boys later."
        </p>
        <p>She said this as she left in a hurry.</p>
        <p>"Well, fuck! She finally left!"</p>
        <p>
          Daniel fell to his knees as he happily shouted. He was really relieved
          now.
        </p>
        <p>"Damn, where did you even fly to?"</p>
        <p>Oliver could not help but ask curiously, making Daniel shudder.</p>
        <p>"I-I… forget it…"</p>
        <p>
          He didn't elaborate and simply walked up to the huge mansion or
          dormitory for them.
        </p>
        <p>"We should also quickly get ourselves a room too and rest."</p>
        <p>Bella asked the others, and they too soon entered the house.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver picked a room in the farthest corner possible to avoid being
          near any of them. The others saw this and did not intrude or take a
          room close to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was basic courtesy that since the other party did not want to share
          too much space, they should not insist either.
        </p>
        <p>They all had their pride to uphold as well.</p>
        <p>
          The day was uneventful as all of them rested in their rooms and set up
          their belongings. The whole house had polished wooden flooring and
          looked quite simple and peaceful inside.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 127: Element awakening ceremony! Alphonso's turn!</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 127</h2>
        <p>
          Oliver was feeling nostalgic. His home was also like this, so it gave
          him a familiar feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next day, all of them gathered in the huge room on the ground
          floor just close to the entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison was sitting before them with her legs crossed as she
          scrutinized each one of them intently.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let us begin now. First of all, I noticed that some of you have yet
          to awaken your elements while some of you have done this already. So
          for those who have not yet awakened their element, we will be doing
          that first," she said and added,
        </p>
        <p>
          "The first course of training will involve honing your elemental
          espera and the associated manipulation training over your element."
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a hint of excitement in their eyes when they heard this.
          They were going to witness the process of others awakening their
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were really curious about what element their peers were about to
          awaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This here is a vial carrying Honorable Stars' Essence, the very thing
          that will serve as a catalyst to help you awaken your element."
        </p>
        <p>
          She instructed as she got up from the chair she was sitting on. Her
          hand was suddenly carrying a vial containing a greenish-colored
          glowing liquid, which was most likely the Honorable Stars' Essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is Honorable Stars' Essence, and it will act as a catalyst to
          stir your espera and awaken an attribute to it. Know that the
          attribute could be purely random or might not match with your parents'
          either. Although that happening is rare, it is not impossible. There
          have been several cases where individuals awaken very different
          elements in contrast to their parents' elements. However, usually, it
          is the same element."
        </p>
        <p>She paused before continuing,</p>

        <p>
          "You all might be aware of this potion to some extent. Know that this
          is a priceless thing and not anyone can get their hands on this. You
          all are fortunate and thus were able to get this chance so easily.
          However, the common exorcist out there might need to pour their life
          savings just to get one if they had the connections to buy one."
        </p>
        <p>
          She gazed at the three kids who were going to awaken their elements
          and told them,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright, come forward when I call your name. I will provide you with
          one bottle of Honorable Stars' Essence and help you awaken an element.
          Those who have already awakened, stand to the side and watch quietly."
        </p>
        <p>
          "This Honorable Stars' Essence was made from extracts obtained from
          harsh environments by very skilled alchemists out there using
          starlight as a catalyst. You can guess how precious it is. Each vial
          contains the distilled essence of starlight."
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at their fascinated expressions and further said, "It's a
          coveted treasure that even myself had to wait to obtain one. Be
          grateful to your clans for arranging them for you lot."
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;"Now, come one by one, Alphonso."</p>
        <p>
          She gazed at the properly dressed kid with neatly combed hair, "You
          come first."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso realized that he was the first one. He did not hesitate and
          walked up to her. He was also curious about what element he was going
          to awaken.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did have some hypotheses in his mind that predicted what element he
          might awaken but was not too sure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those assumptions of his were solely based on what elements his
          parents and grandparents had.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it was going to be a random element, then his guesses would be
          useless.
        </p>
        <p>"I am ready, teacher Alison!"</p>
        <p>He was eager to awaken a new element.</p>
        <p>
          "Drink this and sit down in front of me. Also, keep yourself focused
          during this whole time."
        </p>

        <p>"Yes, ma'am!"</p>
        <p>
          He politely nodded and gracefully sat on the straw mat with his legs
          folded.
        </p>
        <p>
          He slowly started to gulp down the potion that was given to him. A
          burst of energy followed after it inside his body, and he closed his
          eyes and directed his focus to channeling the overflowing power
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the essence coursed through him, Alphonso felt a surge of warmth in
          his core and focused all his concentration on the awakening process.
        </p>
        <p>Everyone watched with anticipation.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver glanced at Evelyn and Bella beside him and Daniel next to them.
          It seemed only they had awakened their elements beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest, Amber, Alphonso, and Nadia, would be undergoing this ritual
          or process of sorts to awaken their elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt lucky to not hastily try to bind the target to Evelyn. He had
          to find an opportunity to get in physical contact with her too for
          some moments.
        </p>
        <p>
          He observed the change in Alphonso's reactions and remembered his own
          past experience. By now, he should have awakened the element already.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had earlier offered Nadia the Honorable Stars' Essence that he had
          received from the Black Codex Federation. However, at that time, she
          had refused his reasons due to her personal conflicts and dignity.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would have long awakened a water element had she drunk that
          Honorable Stars' Essence he had given her in the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this was also not a problem now since she no longer had any reason
          to refuse such a potion from the teacher they had now.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but feel a bit glad since Nadia was now going to
          awaken an element too. He was also going to reap the benefits now
          since awakening an element was a major thing.
        </p>

        <p>
          What Alison had not told them was that there was a chance of failure
          as well, to be not able to awaken anything. But she did not tell them
          for obvious reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each one of them present here had extraordinary backgrounds and
          bloodlines. There was no chance that they were not going to awaken
          anything at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had he already targeted Evelyn earlier, he would have missed this good
          opportunity…
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing he was feeling curious about was what reward he was about to
          obtain.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt a bit perplexed since what would be tenfold of an elemental
          attribute?
        </p>
        <p>Wouldn't that also be an element itself?</p>
        <p>
          Or maybe it was more of a thing related to manipulation and mastery?
          Unlikely but possible nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>"Uhmm…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver heard Alphonso release a grunt as he exhaled and opened his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"I succeeded! Teacher, I have awakened an element!"</p>
        <p>He excitedly said to her.</p>
        <p>"Hmm. Show it then," Alison calmly said.</p>
        <p>"Yes, here it is…"</p>
        <p>
          With a triumphant grin, Alphonso demonstrated his newfound element
          with excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          He concentrated as a huge gust of wind started blowing out from the
          direction of his stretched-out hand. The tip of his fingertip had a
          strong air current gathering non-stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Air element, great. You could specialize in your speed and sharpness.
          The Fallen Heart clan patriarch doesn't have the air element, and
          neither should your mother have it as far as I remember, so it's a
          random element. Wait with the others while the rest complete their
          awakening ceremony."
        </p>
        <p>
          She pointed for him to stand to the side, which he did as he went up
          to the others. He was congratulated.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Congratulations! Your element is awesome!" Bella sincerely praised
          him, which he accepted graciously by thanking her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella's sincere praise lifted Alphonso's spirits even higher. He
          nodded gratefully, he had been quite down since some days—especially
          after coming at last place.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 128: Obtaining 10x rewards! A body constitution!</h2>
        <p>
          "Congratulations! Your element is awesome!" Bella sincerely praised
          him, which he accepted graciously by thanking her.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver also gave his set of praises and let Daniel finish.</p>
        <p>"Woah, dude! I can't wait to spar with you!"</p>
        <p>
          "Next, Amber, come forward," Alisa said as Amber stepped forward,
          drank the potion just like Alphonso did, and started meditating with
          crossed legs.
        </p>
        <p>Soon, she also managed to awaken her own element.</p>
        <p>"I did it! It's the earth element! A great match for me, hahaha."</p>
        <p>
          She cheered joyfully as she, a tool exorcist, was best suited with the
          earth element for crafting and forging techniques as per her clan's
          nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Earth element is indeed suitable for you. Get in line now. We will
          prepare for it accordingly."
        </p>
        <p>
          Again, she was cheered up by Bella and Evelyn. Oliver also added a few
          perfunctory words.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he failed to notice Amber's disappointed look as she heard his
          superficial praise. She silently gritted her teeth; it seemed she was
          still not worth anything in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not understand why, but she was determined to see a hint of
          seriousness for herself in his eyes. She had not felt better ever
          since the mountain climb challenge either.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had been overthinking that Oliver was probably looking down on her
          due to her using tools to aid her climb and not her own strength while
          he was far above everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was she seeking validation? She did not know, but she wanted him to
          acknowledge her seriously.
        </p>

        <p>'Just you wait…'</p>
        <p>
          In fact, Oliver did not even know what she was thinking about; his
          only focus so far had been mostly on Evelyn or Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was quite busy thinking about his future plans here with Alison and
          what sort of training they might be undergoing.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were too many things; he did not even bother thinking about
          Amber at all. He never looked down on any one of them either.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was something she was making up on her own and deceiving herself
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not realize this, and neither did Oliver, who was now intently
          looking at Nadia, whose turn was next.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Next, Nadia, come here and repeat what others did," Alison said as
          she handed her the Honorable Stars' Essence. Nadia narrowed her eyes;
          she remembered this seaweed green-colored potion.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the exact same thing Oliver had wanted to give her when he
          visited her last time in her courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time, she did think it was a rare potion given its glow and
          shine, but she could have never expected him to get his hands on an
          essence as rare as this one.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had some questions in her mind as to how he got his hands on
          something like this and stuff, but she was too cold to ask him face to
          face. She could only remain curious.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could not help but feel her heart pumping faster; he wanted to
          give her such a precious potion at that time even after knowing its
          benefits and uses?
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not know why, but her throat felt as if there was a lump in
          it; she could not turn her head and look at him for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          'No, I must not think about such trivial things. I need to grow
          stronger.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes turned sharp as she gracefully sat down, opened the vial, and
          slowly drank its contents with a slow and steady gulp.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver noticed everyone's attention was focused on her, so he nudged
          Daniel slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm? What is it?" Daniel asked curiously; this was the first time
          that Oliver spoke to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have got nature's call incoming, so I need to leave momentarily.
          The teacher is busy right now, so if she asks, tell her this. I will
          try to be back as soon as possible. Thanks."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not give a chance to speak and directly rushed back towards
          his room with silent footsteps.
        </p>
        <p>
          "…." Daniel was truly speechless. He shook his head and focused on
          Nadia instead; he wanted to know what this powerful girl was going to
          awaken as her element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella also sensed movement behind her and saw him leave silently. She
          frowned. Where was Oliver going at this moment?
        </p>
        <p>Did he not want to see his sister's element?</p>
        <p>____________</p>
        <p>"Huff… huff…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver quickly entered his room, closing the door shut, as he quickly
          assumed a meditative pose. It was about time.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Ding! Target has awakened an espera element after drinking Honorable

        <p>[Constitution will be awakened in the host…]</p>
        <p>"Kuh-!"</p>

        <p>
          Oliver bit his lips as a strong and chilling sensation spread right in
          his heart, quickly spreading and reaching every part of his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          His brain felt numb due to the sudden coldness that exploded inside
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt his body temperature drop significantly; it was as if he was
          slowly freezing—slowly freezing into an ice sculpture.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chill produced was terrifyingly cold; he was experiencing
          frostbite in every part of his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pain was maddening, and he would have already gone crazy had it
          not been for his Level 5 strength that his physique and body were
          improved, and he was able to endure it.
        </p>
        <p>
          This did not mean he was completely fine. In fact, if it was possible,
          he would have screamed out his lungs.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he knew better than to do it actually, given Alison was just below
          with the others.
        </p>
        <p>
          His chest felt particularly cold and numb, and he could feel that his
          heartbeat had slowed down significantly as if he was in a cryogenic
          chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ultra-cold sensation had spread through every bit of his body
          right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The freezing sensation was literally penetrating into his skin,
          inflicting a painful experience.
        </p>
        <p>But Oliver remained steadfast and endured all of it slowly.</p>
        <p>
          He could feel it calming down and a new icy-cold sensation flowing
          through his body…
        </p>

        <p>"Phew…" he exhaled a long breath as his eyes opened slowly.</p>
        <p>
          No sooner did they open, he was met with an extremely strange scene in
          front of him.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 129: She saw it!</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 129</h2>
        <p>"Phew…" he exhaled a long breath as his eyes opened slowly.</p>
        <p>
          No sooner did they open than he was met with an extremely bizarre
          scene in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His surroundings, his room, were covered in layers of frost and
          visibly transparent ice.
        </p>
        <p>His bed, cupboard, and desk were frozen in crystalline ice.</p>
        <p>
          The floor in front of him had white snow particles gathered, forming a
          cluster of snow.
        </p>
        <p>
          And the door behind him also had some ice coating on it along with the
          walls.
        </p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          He finally understood that he had awakened a special physique as the
          tenfold reward for the target awakening an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't expect that the reward would be a whole physique for an
          attribute element.
        </p>
        <p>This was a delightful surprise.</p>
        <p>
          In this world, there were some lucky individuals who were born with or
          awakened special constitutions in the span of their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          These special physiques or constitutions were widely sought after in
          this world, by both demons and humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          People born with such constitutions were highly sought after by
          various factions and clans. No matter how minor a body constitution
          was, someone always paid attention to their powers.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this world, there were bloodlines as well that originated from deep
          roots and highly superior beings to their descendants.
        </p>

        <p>
          The more powerful a bloodline someone had, the more potential they had
          to unlock more innate abilities exclusive to their blood and family
          ancestors.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was also one of the reasons why the five major clans have been
          able to persist so long and keep their dominance over other smaller or
          larger clans and miscellaneous organizations for centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their bloodlines were extremely dense and thick. Not to mention, the
          demons coveted the blood of such people badly. Especially if they were
          descendants of the five major clans or someone as great.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was known that devouring such exorcists granted a very huge boost
          to these demons, so they were quite crazed about them and even offered
          tremendous prices to anyone who brought them that blood or even the
          person itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, Oliver also had the direct blood from none other than the
          patriarch and matriarch of the Mystic Purge Clan. His blood was
          extremely precious.
        </p>
        <p>
          But, had it been the case, he would have been born talented or with
          some talent at least due to the blood. However, he did not.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was most likely due to the fact that his bloodline was not dense
          or rather was not able to balance the power of the two powerful
          bloodlines into one, and thus his bloodline was weaker than his
          siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was quite strange, how did his body was the only one to be messed
          up out of all siblings?&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a really worrisome matter to not have a potent bloodline
          despite being the heir of a major clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Oliver, who knew about this, was not all that worried about such
          stuff at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could feel that after becoming the Circuit of Abyss, his very being
          had undergone a significant change.
        </p>
        <p>
          His bloodline had completely transformed into something else as well.
          It was not a simple matter.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could tell this much from the unknown knowledge he had received in
          his mind when he became connected to the Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had been slowly trying to decipher and understand bit by bit of
          what the information was all about everyday.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be soon when he manages to obtain some clues about the
          changes in his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in the novel he read, there was no explicit mention of Abyss and
          anything related to such…
        </p>
        <p>
          Either way, there were countless mysterious things that he was not
          aware of and had to focus on.
        </p>

        <p>For now, it was better to become strong enough first.</p>
        <p>He was already quite strong for being a Rank-1 exorcist.</p>
        <p>
          Right now, his main focus was to stabilize the power and train his
          elemental abilities along as well.
        </p>
        <p>__________</p>
        <p>
          Exhaling slightly, he could feel a chilly sensation spreading
          throughout his body.
        </p>
        <p>Crack… Crack…</p>
        <p>
          He slowly tried to stand up, and small cracking sounds were heard as
          he felt the thin ice layer beneath him shatter when he stood up.
        </p>
        <p>'How do I clean up this icy mess?'</p>
        <p>
          He was just wondering when he heard footsteps closing in followed by a
          series of knocking sounds.
        </p>
        <p>Knock! Knock!</p>
        <p>
          "Oliver, are you fine? Teacher Alison is almost finished with
          awakening Nadia's element. You are going to miss it."
        </p>
        <p>
          He heard the feminine soft voice and instantly recognized the owner.
        </p>
        <p>It was Bella.</p>
        <p>She was here to get him?</p>
        <p>
          He frowned. Had it already been long enough for someone to come
          looking for him?
        </p>
        <p>
          He did ask Daniel to be a proxy for him in case someone asked, but he
          did not expect Bella to suddenly come up.
        </p>
        <p>"Oliver, are you there?"</p>

        <p>
          Bella's voice once again sounded out as he contemplated whether to
          reply to her or not.
        </p>
        <p>'Would she leave if I don't speak?'</p>
        <p>
          He decided to remain quiet and wait for her to leave on her own after
          being ignored.
        </p>
        <p>And as he had expected, she soon stopped calling out.</p>
        <p>
          Just as he heaved a sigh of relief, he once again heard her voice.
        </p>
        <p>"I am coming inside, please excuse me—"</p>
        <p>She pushed the door open as it slowly creaked open.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver froze in his tracks. She actually entered his room like that?
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked in shock as he watched her face while she also met his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of them had a face of shock with surprise written all over their
          expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was partly shocked by the fact that this girl really dared to
          enter his room just like that. He didn't expect someone like her, who
          used to maintain a proper sense of manners and discipline, to come in
          just like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Where did all those manners go? Isn't it common sense not to enter
          someone's room if they are not there? Why did she enter then?
        </p>
        <p>'And not to mention, these doors seriously require locks!'</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the wooden door in frustration. There was no lock there.
          How would they maintain their privacy like this?
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, Bella literally brute-forced the door. There was still
          a thin layer of ice covering the door, but she had just opened it,
          directly ripping off the ice sticking to the door frame.
        </p>
        <p>
          But on second thought, when he remembered how high up on the mountain
          they were and how isolated this house was, there was not really a need
          for installing locks on individual rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Especially not when someone dangerous like Alison was living there
          alone. Who would dare intrude in such a place guarded by a strong
          veteran exorcist?
        </p>
        <p>Definitely someone with a death wish…</p>
        <p>He shook his head and focused on the girl in front of him.</p>
        <p>
          The room was still frozen and Bella was gawking at him and the room
          with a shocked look.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes turned sharp, he was feeling really displeased at her abrupt
          entry.
        </p>
        <p>
          She really intended to barge in his room... if she had not intended to
          do so then she would have left when she was met with resistance from
          the frozen door hinges, yet she pushed open the door.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 130: Removing the ice from the room!</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 130</h2>
        <p>
          He had always wondered how perverts in anime were able to barge inside
          any room and have incidents. Why did they not lock the door
          beforehand? Was this the same situation? Or something similar to that?
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed internally. He had to do something about this problem in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, now that he was seen by Bella, he did not feel flustered as
          he had expected to initially. On the contrary, his heart remained
          calm.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is this related to the Eternal Winter Physique?' he thought about how
          the new physique would affect his body and mind from now on.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gazed at Bella, who was looking at his face in surprise before her
          eyes wandered to the room covered in ice and frost.
        </p>
        <p>"T-This…?" she mumbled, her tone carrying a hint of astonishment.</p>
        <p>"What happened to this room?"</p>
        <p>
          Finally, she could no longer help but question the guy at the center
          of it all.
        </p>
        <p>"Before that, Bella… why did you enter my room?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver replied to her with a question rather than an answer. It was an
          age-old mind tactic where to divert someone's attention from a
          particular topic, the party would answer with a question rather than a
          reply.
        </p>

        <p>
          And it was effective as Bella flinched when she remembered this
          discourtesy of hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I-" she spoke, "I am sorry, I saw that you were not there and your
          sister was about to awaken her element for the first time. I did not
          want you to miss such a precious moment, and you were not coming back,
          so I was worried if you were in some situation."
        </p>
        <p>
          She paused as she met his eyes with a hint of seriousness. It was true
          when she said that she came here because of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when she did not receive any response, she could not control her
          curiosity to see what he was doing to miss such a moment and entered
          his room like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was aware of how disrespectful this action was, for her to barge
          into someone else's room.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she really could not control her curiosity and wanted to know what
          he was up to.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her determined eyes and was speechless. Any onlooker
          would think that he had done something wrong if they did not know the
          situation beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>
          He forced himself not to facepalm. So much for being a sophisticated
          heir of major clans.
        </p>
        <p>"Fine, leave now. I will come later."</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and asked her to leave. He had to remove the icy
          layer.
        </p>
        <p>
          "But-" she stopped. She wanted to say something but in the end did not
          speak, "—well… come quickly. Nadia is stabilizing the element, so it
          should not be too late."
        </p>
        <p>
          Saying so, she silently closed the door and left. She knew that she
          should not pry too much into his matters. She could already feel that
          Oliver did look disappointed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scene of the room flashed through her mind. When she opened the
          door, she clearly felt the chilly temperature in the room. It was very
          cold, and she could feel it on her skin.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was as if the room was experiencing a different season—a cold
          winter.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to know what that was. Even his skin had frost coverings on
          it as if someone had frozen him, but she did not ask him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone had their own secrets, and it was probably his secret. If he
          did not feel comfortable sharing it, then she should not interfere.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Haah… what is happening? Where is the composure that I had been
          maintaining so far? I have been losing control of myself more often
          nowadays.'
        </p>
        <p>In the end, she returned downstairs.</p>
        <p>__________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at the ice coatings and stretched out his hand. With
          just his will alone, the ice and frost in the room started to quiver
          before cracking and popping sounds started to echo in the room.
        </p>
        <p>Crunch!</p>
        <p>
          Like glass shattering, all the icy layers broke into thin and small
          pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          His finger moved and made an upward motion as a strong current of
          espera released from the tip of his finger.
        </p>
        <p>
          The countless shattered small ice pieces started to float above the
          ground, as they suddenly started to gather at a single point.
        </p>
        <p>Crackle! Crackle!</p>

        <p>
          More and more ice pieces followed and started to merge together before
          a small ice sphere started to take shape.
        </p>
        <p>It was a small transparent crystalline ice ball.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver beckoned the ice ball toward himself. The floating crystal
          sphere levitated towards him before landing in his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt the freezing temperature on his skin as he held the ice ball.
        </p>
        <p>Tap Tap Tap</p>
        <p>
          He moved towards the only window in the room and opened the sash using
          the handles.
        </p>
        <p>
          He held out the crystal ice ball. In the very next instant, the ball
          of ice started to churn and deform before turning into cold water and
          flowing down his palm.
        </p>
        <p>
          He already had some mastery over the water element, which was his
          first awakened element, so it was not a big deal that he was able to
          convert ice back to water.
        </p>
        <p>
          After making sure that everything was normal, he went downstairs as
          well, where he saw Nadia almost finished doing everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          He reached just in time. She opened her eyes and looked around. Their
          eyes met as Oliver gave her a thumbs up.
        </p>
        <p>She stood up and looked at Alison.</p>
        <p>"So which is it?" she questioned in interest.</p>
        <p>"Ice element."</p>
        <p>
          "That's a great one—a hybrid element is often more powerful in both
          offense and defense compared to basic elements." Her eyes lit up when
          she said this. She looked around. "It is no secret, and you all don't
          need to make such faces. Accept the truth."
        </p>
        <p>
          She said as she side-glanced at Alphonso and Amber, who were making
          difficult faces. She smiled as she further added,
        </p>
        <p>
          "However, it all comes down to the person themselves. With enough
          mastery, even the least offensive element could turn into a deadly
          weapon if sharpened enough. Be hardworking and don't be disappointed."
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing this, their expressions eased up slightly, albeit slightly
          stiff nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now that you all have managed to awaken your elements, it is time to
          start for real."
        </p>
