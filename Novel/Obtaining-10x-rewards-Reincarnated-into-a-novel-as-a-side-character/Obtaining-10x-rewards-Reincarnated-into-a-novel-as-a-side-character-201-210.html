        <h2>
          Chapter 201 &nbsp;Arriving at the park! Now where's the artifact?
        </h2>
        <p>Chapter 201</p>
        <p>
          She could only give up and look for other arrangements for the proud
          exorcist sitting inside the car. Her fingers trembled slightly as she
          scrolled through her phone, feeling the weight of her unusual
          responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigh, why do I have to do this? The thought echoed in her mind, a mix
          of frustration and resignation settling in.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, she found a relatively good-looking hotel with a lot of
          reviews and booked a room for him. As for the duration of the stay,
          she put that on hold and let the exorcist inside decide it there.
        </p>
        <p>"Not bad."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at the average hotel of this world, which was just like
          any normal hotel.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes scanned the building, noting the modest architecture and the
          simple yet functional design. It wasn't luxurious, but it would do.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at the driver, and she shrank slightly. Her posture
          instinctively shifted, as if anticipating either praise or critique.
          He added, "Good job."
        </p>
        <p>
          He opened his smartphone and paid her the money and the tip he had
          mentioned earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Many thanks! Great exorcist! Please use my services again in the
          future!" Her voice was now lighter, filled with excitement at the
          generous payment. The tension she had been holding melted away with
          the promise of future work.
        </p>

        <p>
          She bowed excitedly as she saw the handsome tip in her account and
          quickly escorted him inside the hotel to the reception before leaving.
          Her footsteps were quick, almost skipping, as she hurried to exit
          after ensuring everything was in order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her earlier nervousness melted away, replaced by the thrill of having
          served such a prestigious client.
        </p>
        <p>
          The staff inside was also extremely respectful, either already
          informed by the guards or the driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their eyes widened slightly at his presence, whispering amongst
          themselves as they recognized the emblem of the Mystic Purge Clan.
        </p>
        <p>He skipped all formalities and went directly to his room.</p>
        <p>
          The hushed voices behind him faded as he made his way down the dimly
          lit corridor, his focus already shifting to more pressing matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon reaching his room, the first thing he did was scan for any
          abnormalities or recording devices. His eyes glowed faintly as he
          scanned the surroundings, his senses sharpening to detect any unwanted
          surprises.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every corner of the room came into view with a clarity that bordered
          on the supernatural, his heightened senses ensuring there were no
          hidden threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he was sure they would not dare, he still preferred to be
          careful now that he was out of the clan. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          He was still wary of the Unholy Sun Sect. He had missed the heretic
          woman at that time, and although he had destroyed her mentality
          completely, he still couldn't afford to be careless.
        </p>
        <p>
          A flicker of unease crossed his mind, reminding him that even
          shattered minds could find ways to strike back.
        </p>
        <p>
          The memory of their encounter flickered in his mind, reminding him
          that loose ends could always come back to haunt him.
        </p>

        <p>
          With the countless sinister methods of the heretic sects, they might
          extract some information on him and his identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right now, the heretic sect, or what was left of it, was hiding in
          fear and would not dare to show in public for years to come, in fear
          of drawing the wrath of the major clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          But fear wasn't always enough to stop desperate people, and
          desperation made enemies unpredictable.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the disaster beast egg was still with him, and those heretics'
          lives were controlled by demons behind them on the other side of the
          world.
        </p>
        <p>They might just force them to continue searching for the egg.</p>
        <p>So he had to be careful at all times.</p>
        <p>
          After making sure everything was safe, he decided to start with a
          small search of the city, especially where the artifact was suspected
          to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The city is really similar to how it was in my original world." There
          was a wistfulness in his voice, a faint memory from a life that seemed
          distant now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had a dazed look on his face as he stared at the tall buildings
          and then at the residential area.
        </p>
        <p>Everything reminded him of the past.</p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, and his eyes turned sharp. The nostalgia dissolved
          as his focus snapped back to the present, his mind once again on the
          mission at hand. He easily passed through crowds of people heading
          toward the central playground located north of the residential area.
        </p>

        <p>
          With his speed, it didn't take him long before he reached the
          playground.
        </p>
        <p>It was a huge park, of sorts, in reality.</p>
        <p>
          He noticed some people taking a stroll or just sitting while watching
          children play.
        </p>
        <p>
          Laughter and conversation filled the air, but none of it registered in
          Oliver's mind as he remained laser-focused on his surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>
          He walked around the park, and under the guise of his cloak, no one
          could see his hair or face, which helped him a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          And with the [Cloak of Darkness] in effect, ordinary people had an
          even harder time spotting him, much less noticing him. The cloak
          seemed to absorb the light around him, rendering him almost invisible
          to the casual observer.
        </p>
        <p>
          So despite looking shady with a cloak covering him, he was still able
          to inspect calmly.
        </p>
        <p>
          It took him half an hour as he toured every corner of the playground,
          trying to sense any abnormalities in anything around the park. But
          despite being vigilant and careful, he found nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each sweep of his senses returned empty, the playground appearing
          frustratingly ordinary.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, it wouldn't be in the Black Codex Federation if it was so
          easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had expected this outcome already. He was in the city mainly to
          fulfill the mission from Jenna to determine his rank in the
          organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for the clan mission? He could delay it; there was still plenty of
          time before the deadline approached.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weight of the mission wasn't pressing, allowing him to explore the
          city at his own pace.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was enough that he could roam freely around for a good amount of
          time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver shook his head. His lips pressed into a thin line as the
          familiar feeling of dissatisfaction crept in.
        </p>
        <p>It was indeed difficult...</p>
        <p>...for a normal exorcist.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 202 &nbsp;What is it? Jenna's curiosity!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 202</p>
        <p>
          It would have indeed been a difficult mission for a normal Rank-1 to
          sense and identify the abnormality; however, he was different.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world around him shifted as he stared at the park. Colors dulled
          and sharpened in his vision, while shapes morphed subtly, revealing
          hidden layers beneath the surface. His eyes flashed in a mysterious
          color as everything was revealed to him. The trees, the people, the
          very air itself seemed to shift in his vision as hidden truths were
          laid bare before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every pulse of energy, every unseen current in the atmosphere became
          visible, threads of power weaving through the ordinary scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could see through everything, and just by standing in one corner,
          he was able to see the entirety of the park.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't matter if there were trees or people in between; his eyes
          could see past everything at a glance. It was as if the physical world
          was a mere veil, easily peeled away by his gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was like peeling away layers of reality, exposing what lay beneath
          the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          He slowly observed the signs of abnormality, and his eyes narrowed as
          he witnessed something.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Interesting…" A cold smile curled at the edge of his lips, the
          faintest hint of satisfaction flickering in his expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without lingering in the park any longer, he returned to the hotel.
          His footsteps were light but purposeful, his mind already racing ahead
          to the next steps.
        </p>
        <p>He had found something interesting.</p>
        <p>_________________</p>
        <p>At the Mystic Purge Clan</p>
        <p>
          Sigh, what a chaotic situation… Jenna thought, her fingers lightly
          drumming the armrest, a distant look in her eyes as she considered the
          events unfolding.
        </p>

        <p>
          She leaned back in her chair as she gazed out of the window, her eyes
          distant, as if observing something far away.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sunlight filtering through the window cast long shadows on the
          floor, but her eyes seemed to see far beyond the confines of the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Still, who could have expected that his sudden departure would make
          them this restless?" Her voice was soft but carried a note of
          amusement, as if she were privy to a game only she could see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips curled slightly as she spoke, a knowing smile playing on her
          face.
        </p>
        <p>
          She stroked her chin and had a meaningful look in her eyes. Each
          movement was deliberate, her mind calculating the possibilities with
          the precision of a seasoned strategist.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Does that mean they were already aware of the abnormal potential in
          that boy? Or did they realize this recently…? Given the recent
          arrangement, it seems they found out during the demon hunt event."
        </p>
        <p>
          She smirked, her face as beautiful as a piece of fine jade. Yet behind
          that beauty was something far more dangerous, a mind always scheming,
          always two steps ahead. There was a sharpness to her expression now,
          like a blade concealed in velvet.
        </p>
        <p>
          She tapped the armrest of her chair and said aloud, "Go and take
          advantage of the situation. The supreme elders have all been in
          closed-door seclusion since the last century. Now is the perfect
          time." Her voice was a quiet command, laced with a calm authority that
          brooked no hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she looked outside the window, a black shadow of a man emerged
          behind her. The shadow moved with an unnatural fluidity, its form
          shifting briefly before solidifying into the shape of a man kneeling.
          The shadow knelt and answered, "Yes, madam."
        </p>
        <p>
          It disappeared as quickly as it had appeared. Like smoke dissipating
          into thin air, the figure vanished, leaving no trace of its presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna still didn't turn around, but in the next moment, a purple medal
          appeared in her hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Oliver were here, he would have easily recognized the medal as the
          same dark artifact he had sold to her long ago.
        </p>
        <p>The [Medal of Eternal Pain].</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, how I wish I could act now… but no, there's still some time." Her
          voice dropped to a whisper, filled with both longing and restraint.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her slender fingers grazed the metallic surface of the purple medal as
          she whispered.
        </p>

        <p>
          The cool metal sent a faint vibration through her fingertips, but her
          expression remained unchanged.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Unexpectedly, the boy gave me something important for my revenge. My
          plans have accelerated significantly thanks to this." Her eyes
          darkened as she spoke, the weight of her words heavy with intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          She gazed at the medal, the potent dark espera radiating from it
          seeming to have no effect on her. This dark espera, known to have
          driven countless people mad, was ineffective in her hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Compared to this, some void dust is a fair trade… Still, I am quite
          curious about what he needs such a thing for." A glint of curiosity
          flickered in her eyes, though it quickly gave way to calculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pondered deeply but could not come up with anything. n/ô/vel/b//jn
          dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Void dust was not something simple. It was found in mysterious black
          rocks that sometimes fell from the sky. Not only was void dust a very
          powerful material, but in the hands of an exceptional alchemist, it
          could turn into something phenomenal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Obtaining void dust was not easy, but for her, one of the top
          executives of the Black Code Federation, it wasn't a resource she
          lacked. Her position ensured that even the most elusive materials were
          within reach.
        </p>
        <p>This was also why she had easily agreed to Oliver's request.</p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, after Oliver left the clan, the information was quickly
          sent to the top elders in charge of handling the missions, causing a
          stir in the department.
        </p>
        <p>
          The swift transmission of information triggered a chain reaction, the
          ripple effect of his departure spreading quickly through the ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was no trivial matter that one of the heirs was so easily assigned
          a mission without anyone being aware of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          A thorough investigation was already underway to identify the cause of
          it all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, she had already cleared all traces relating to her
          beforehand, so no matter what, the investigations would never lead
          back to her in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had covered her tracks meticulously, like a spider spinning an
          invisible web around her actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, she was curious if the clan would act as she had expected or do
          something else. Her fingers drummed the armrest again, her mind racing
          with possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>___________</p>
        <p>"Did you find it?"</p>
        <p>
          An old man sitting in a leather chair in a beautifully decorated
          office questioned the middle-aged woman in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 203 &nbsp;The night has come!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 203</p>
        <p>"Did you find it?"</p>
        <p>
          An old man sitting in a leather chair in a beautifully decorated
          office questioned the middle-aged woman in front of him. The dim light
          from the chandelier overhead cast shadows across the polished wood,
          giving the room a somber yet grand ambiance. The office was lavish yet
          subdued, its decorations reflecting both wealth and power without
          being ostentatious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bookshelves lined the walls, filled with ancient texts and artifacts,
          each one a silent testament to the elder's influence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Elder, the person who issued the mission has already been taken into
          custody, and upon investigation, he confessed that he was unaware the
          other party was a main heir of the clan."
        </p>
        <p>
          The old man raised a brow at her words and could not help but frown.
          The deepening lines on his face looked like cracks in stone, a
          testament to years of hardened authority. The lines on his face
          deepened, his expression hardening as he absorbed the information.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He didn't know who the other party was and still issued the mission?"
          he asked coldly. There was an icy sharpness in his tone, each word
          calculated to pierce through the woman's calm exterior. His voice had
          an icy edge to it, each word cutting through the air like a blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The middle-aged woman calmly explained, "Yes, elder. It's as illogical
          as you think; however, we have 'properly' and 'thoroughly'
          investigated the man." Her tone was measured, carefully choosing her
          words to hint at the darker methods of interrogation used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon hearing the woman's words, which carried a hidden meaning, the
          old man wore a thoughtful look. His fingers tapped lightly against the
          arm of his chair as he considered her statement, the implication not
          lost on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew better than anyone how terrifying the clan's interrogation
          force was. Even the strongest would immediately cower and beg to
          confess everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          The memory of past sessions flickered in his mind—screams, broken
          wills, and secrets dragged out under duress.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were quite notorious in the clan, and it was known that even
          elders could not easily resist their interrogation. The memory of past
          interrogations flickered through his mind, a grim reminder of the
          power the clan held over its members.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So? What is your conclusion?" he asked, wondering why the woman had
          come to him. She was only ordered to appear before him after she had
          figured out who the person was and why he did what he did.
        </p>
        <p>
          His tone was clipped, expecting efficiency. He didn't have time for
          anything less than clear answers.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, I have concluded that young master Oliver used an artifact when
          he appeared in the mission hall." The woman's eyes gleamed with
          certainty as she revealed her findings, her voice steady, unshaken by
          the elder's imposing demeanor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "An artifact?" The elder raised a brow; this was something he had also
          suspected after hearing the woman's words. His curiosity piqued,
          though his face remained as unreadable as stone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A decent artifact. I believe its functions were primarily focused on
          stealth and deception, which enabled the young master to sneak out of
          the clan as well." Her explanation was concise, but beneath her calm
          exterior, she felt a slight tension, knowing that the elder expected
          nothing short of precision.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm." The elder simply hummed, neither agreeing nor disagreeing.
          "From what I heard from my subordinate, that does seem to be the case.
          She was the first to see through his cover; however, young master
          ordered her not to interfere and to leave. He had also told her that
          he would return after finishing his 'work,' which, obviously, he
          didn't do."
        </p>
        <p>
          By "subordinate," he was referring to the exorcist woman Oliver had
          met earlier, who had seen through his disguise at the time. As
          expected, she ratted him out as soon as she left.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, elder. What are your orders?" the woman asked, seeking guidance
          on her next course of action.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her voice was measured, betraying none of the nervousness she felt
          standing before such a powerful figure.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The great elder is in seclusion at the moment, so we cannot disturb
          him. I dare not inform Madam Ophelia about this matter either, lest I
          face her wrath. Our first objective is to locate young master Oliver."
        </p>

        <p>
          He paused, picking up a pen and scribbling some words on a nearby
          sheet of paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scratching of the pen was sharp in the still air, the elder's
          focus on the note uninterrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
          "The mission assigned to the young master by the clan administration
          was to eradicate some demonic ghosts in this city. Assuming he left
          some days ago, he should have arrived by now. Dispatch a team to find
          young master and bring him back as soon as possible."
        </p>
        <p>He spoke sternly as he stroked his beard.</p>
        <p>"Understood, elder."</p>
        <p>
          The woman responded seriously, "I will personally handpick my best
          subordinates and have them escort the young master back to the clan as
          soon and as safely as possible."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are dismissed then." The elder waved her off with a flick of his
          wrist, his attention already shifting to the next task at hand.
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>"Achoo!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver sneezed and wiped his nose. A sudden gust of cold air brushed
          past him, sending an involuntary shiver down his spine. He had just
          been thinking about a certain fat white cat when he sneezed.
        </p>
        <p>
          What everyone didn't know was that he wasn't in the city mentioned in
          the mission. Instead, he was actually in a city far away from it—the
          City of Harlington—where he was to complete the mission from the Black
          Codex Federation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had two missions: one from the clan and the other from Jenna. The
          latter was more important since it would determine his hierarchy in
          the organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have made sufficient preparations. It's time to create the Sword of
          Negativity!" Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes turned determined as he looked at the sun slowly sinking
          beyond the clouds, a faint blanket of darkness slowly covering the
          sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fading light seemed to herald the approach of something darker,
          more ominous.
        </p>

        <p>Chapter 204</p>
        <p>
          The fading light seemed to herald the approach of something darker,
          more ominous.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, today was clearly not the night when the moon would rise.
        </p>
        <p>It was a moonless night.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver patiently waited as he leaped onto the hotel's roof and stood
          there, gazing at the sky without moving. The vast expanse of stars
          above him remained concealed by the thick, clouded sky, casting the
          world into a deeper, more unsettling darkness. The cool night air
          brushed against his skin, but he remained motionless, his focus
          unwavering.
        </p>
        <p>
          He watched as the sun disappeared, and the darkness thickened by the
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The last traces of light were swallowed by the creeping night, leaving
          behind an oppressive silence that seemed to envelop everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world below grew quieter, the city's lights flickering on one by
          one as the night took over.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hum of distant traffic faded into the background, and the soft
          murmur of people moving about the streets became almost nonexistent,
          as if the city itself was holding its breath.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's close…" His voice was a whisper, barely audible, as he felt the
          espera around him shift.
        </p>
        <p>
          He murmured to himself as he leaped off the hotel's roof, heading out
          of the city. His feet barely touched the ground, his movements swift
          and fluid, blending seamlessly into the shadows that draped the narrow
          streets. His body moved swiftly, the ground a blur beneath him as he
          pushed forward into the night. There was no spot in the city suitable
          for creating the Sword of Negativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't want to risk causing irreversible damage to the city or
          getting noticed by the major powers outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, with his identity as the young master of the Mystic Purge
          Clan, no one would dare trouble him openly. But power drew attention,
          and he wasn't ready for curious eyes to pry into his affairs just yet.
          But he didn't want to stand out so brazenly, and he certainly didn't
          want anyone disturbing the process of forming the Sword of Negativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly passed through the city gates, easily bypassing the guards
          by using his cloak to hide his presence. The guards stood lazily at
          their posts, completely unaware of the shadow slipping past them, as
          if the night itself had swallowed him whole. The faint shimmer of the
          cloak enveloped him, making him blend seamlessly into the shadows. He
          appeared some distance away from the city. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          "The darkness will soon reach its peak, and that will be the signal to
          start!" His voice was steady, filled with anticipation as he gazed at
          the horizon where the last remnants of twilight had long faded.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't hesitate any longer and took out the void dust from his
          mindspace. The air around him seemed to shift slightly as if
          recognizing the ominous power he was about to unleash.
        </p>
        <p>
          A thick pouch filled with glowing black sand appeared as he occupied a
          spot in front. The black particles glittered faintly in the moonless
          night, their glow almost otherworldly, casting eerie reflections onto
          the surrounding ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking out the void dust, he started spreading it onto the ground,
          arranging the void dust exactly as he had learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each grain of dust fell with precision, as though he were weaving
          together the threads of a grand, cosmic design.
        </p>

        <p>
          First, he drew a circle, then proceeded to make complex structures
          inside the circle, as if he were drawing a runic design. The shapes
          and symbols he traced into the ground began to pulse faintly, an
          ancient rhythm that seemed to resonate with the deeper forces of the
          universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          It became incredibly complex as he kept spreading the void dust onto
          the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, with the knowledge firmly sealed in his memories, he had no
          problems arranging the patterns on the ground slowly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, an extremely complex array was finished, and no sooner did
          Oliver place the last bit of void dust to complete the structure, it
          started to react, and a deep, unsettling energy began to gather on the
          surface of the circular array.
        </p>
        <p>
          The darkness was now at its peak, and everything was darker than ever.
          It was a suffocating kind of darkness, one that swallowed sound and
          light alike, leaving only the presence of the malevolent energy
          building beneath him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver noticed these changes and quickly took the next step. His heart
          quickened, not out of fear, but with the thrill of what was about to
          unfold. Following the guide in his memory, he did not hesitate and
          stepped inside the circular array, walking up to stand at the central
          point.
        </p>
        <p>
          The unsettling energy intensified and began to seep directly into his
          body without hesitation. It was cold and heavy, like a flood of ink
          pouring into his veins, filling every corner of his being with its
          oppressive weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          A deep chill emerged from the depths of his heart as he felt the
          ominous negativity gathering in his body. His breath hitched slightly
          as the coldness spread, tendrils of darkness curling into his mind,
          whispering thoughts not entirely his own. It seemed to affect every
          part of him, be it his heart or his mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, with such terrifying negative energy entering someone, they
          would lose control of their mind, and their heart and mind would be
          corrupted by intense negative emotions and dangerous thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>But who was Oliver?</p>
        <p>
          Abyss energy flooded every corner of his body as if it were his own
          blood, directly covering the negativity that was gathering and
          suppressing it. The dark energy wrestled against his own power, but
          Oliver's control was absolute. The abyssal force within him surged
          forward like a tidal wave, crashing over the negativity and bending it
          to his will. This allowed Oliver to maintain a strong hold over the
          negativity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver noticed that the negativity was extremely overbearing,
          confirming what he had suspected. The source of negativity was born
          from the invisible part of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt ancient, primal, as if it had existed long before the stars
          themselves had begun to burn.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 205 &nbsp;Forgotten weapon of the past!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 205</p>
        <p>
          The universe was divided into two ends: positive and negative. Oliver
          felt the divide as if it were a chasm stretching endlessly beyond what
          his eyes could see—a separation that no mortal could ever hope to
          cross. The people who resided in the positive region could not detect
          or see the things belonging to the negative region; they could only
          perceive its existence.
        </p>
        <p>Such was the case with the other side as well.</p>
        <p>
          This was similar to how matter and antimatter were speculated by
          people to represent the opposing ends of the universe—two halves of a
          whole, constantly at odds, bound by laws far older than the stars
          themselves. Opposites that could never touch, separated by an unseen
          divide that even the greatest of powers could not cross freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two regions, positive and negative, could never interact or meet.
          The forces at play were far too great, the consequences too
          cataclysmic. This was the core principle of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          When matter and antimatter come into contact, they annihilate each
          other and release a large amount of energy. A cosmic dance of creation
          and destruction, one that had shaped the universe as it was known.
          This process was termed "annihilation" by the people of both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
          The negativity required to create what Oliver wanted came from the
          other side of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't just energy—it was the raw, unfiltered force of the negative
          side, an element that defied comprehension in the positive world.
        </p>
        <p>
          As far as he knew, he was in the positive region of the universe and
          therefore required a medium to draw in the negativity—the power from
          the other end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The circular circuit beneath him worked as a channel for that. The
          lines of the array pulsed faintly, their energy humming in tune with
          the void dust scattered across the ground. With void dust, known to
          have formed from the shards of void, used as the material to create
          the array, it helped him establish a firm connection to the negative
          side of the universe.
        </p>
        <p>
          This also had another benefit. Since people in the positive region of
          the universe could not easily detect negativity, it gave him a way to
          conceal any abnormal activity that might occur.
        </p>
        <p>
          He still took precautions by performing this in an isolated location
          to prevent any variables.
        </p>

        <p>
          No matter how confident he felt, there was always room for the
          unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The world outside was none the wiser to the forces he was
          manipulating; to them, the night was just another moonless one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver patiently accumulated the overwhelming negativity into his body
          as time passed with every second.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each second stretched longer, the pressure within him growing heavier,
          yet strangely, it felt like it belonged—a part of him being
          reawakened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each moment felt like an eternity, the pressure mounting inside him as
          the negativity flowed deeper into his core.
        </p>
        <p>
          It filled every crevice of his being, like water seeping into cracks,
          except this water was darker, colder, more dangerous than anything he
          had ever experienced.
        </p>
        <p>
          The night was still and silent, allowing a strange sense of
          synchronization to occur between his body and the overbearing
          negativity. The rhythm of the universe seemed to slow, syncing with
          the pulse of the energy now coursing through him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver observed the negativity condensing within his body. The
          blackness swirled and coiled inside him, a living force that bent to
          his will, ready to be shaped.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was both chaotic and controlled, like a storm he held within the
          palm of his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the strange synchronization he now felt with the negativity, he
          began to take action, shaping the form of the negativity as described
          in the method from his memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          The night continued as Oliver became immersed in the process,
          forgetting everything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time lost its meaning as he focused entirely on the energy inside him,
          every thought directed at molding it into the weapon it was meant to
          become.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stars slowly became visible in the sky as time passed, and a
          strange scene occurred, unnoticed by Oliver.
        </p>

        <p>
          The constellations above seemed to twist and shift, faint lights
          flickering in patterns that had not been seen for centuries, as though
          the universe itself was reacting to the power being called upon below.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if the cosmos were whispering, shifting in their ancient
          positions to witness the birth of something long-forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
          A soft ethereal white light that seemed to belong to the countless
          stars above fell onto his body at the same time as the negativity was
          filling him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light wrapped around him like a gentle veil, contrasting sharply
          with the dark energy coursing through his veins. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          From below, there was an endless stream of black negativity, while
          from above, a steady stream of pure white starlight fell on his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          The forces collided within him but did not fight—somehow, they
          intertwined, each one respecting the other's presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both energies seemed to envelop his body while he was busy condensing
          the weapon inside. The air around him crackled with potential, an
          invisible storm raging within the confines of his being.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a mystical scene. A cosmic dance between light and dark, life
          and death, all contained within the solitary figure of a boy drawing
          on powers beyond comprehension.
        </p>
        <p>"Phew…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver broke out of his trance-like state and was startled to see
          bright sunlight falling onto him. His vision blurred slightly,
          adjusting to the sudden shift from the deep, infinite darkness to the
          blinding warmth of day. He squinted as the light filtered through the
          leaves of the trees he was standing beneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked down to see the array circuit had also disappeared, as all
          the void dust had been used up after serving its purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground bore no sign of the immense power that had just coursed
          through it, leaving only the faint memory of the ritual that had taken
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          He leaned against the tree and slowly sat next to it, beads of sweat
          rolling down his forehead, indicating the hard work he had done.
        </p>
        <p>
          His muscles ached, the toll of channeling such energy settling in, but
          a sense of accomplishment washed over him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a small smile was etched on his face as he beamed, "Finally, it's
          done."
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 206 &nbsp;A call! Unexpected surprise?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 206</p>
        <p>"Finally, it's done," Oliver smiled slightly and whispered.</p>
        <p>
          He glanced at the city far away and stretched out his hand, muttering
          a call. The world seemed to still as he whispered the name. The world
          around him seemed to pause, the air itself holding still as though
          bracing for what was about to emerge.
        </p>
        <p>"[Neglegentis]"</p>
        <p>
          In the next instant, a pulsing black sword suddenly emerged from the
          void into his hand, seemingly out of nowhere. The atmosphere crackled
          faintly, distorting around the sword's dark presence, as though space
          itself recoiled from its arrival. The air around it warped slightly,
          the weapon's presence disturbing the very space it occupied.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sword oozed an unsettling feeling all around it. Its mere presence
          seemed to sap the warmth from the air, leaving behind a cold,
          oppressive aura. It hummed faintly, as if alive, its dark aura
          spreading like mist from the blade's edge. It was pitch black with a
          terrifying, blurry construct. It looked as though the blade was
          constantly shifting, like shadows swirling in an endless void. It was
          as if Oliver was holding a sword made of steam, not material.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the look of the sword was enough to give chills to even the
          veterans among veterans, masters among masters.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was an ancient malice about it, a power so old and dangerous
          that anyone in its presence would instinctively know to fear it.
        </p>
        <p>However, something was odd about the sword.</p>
        <p>
          The hilt of the sword, the place where you hold it, was pitch white!
        </p>
        <p>
          The pure white hilt seemed to glow faintly, an ethereal light that
          stood in sharp opposition to the darkness of the blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The stark contrast between the shadowy blade and the pristine hilt was
          almost jarring, as though the weapon itself carried within it the
          balance of light and dark.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was a paradox in form, two forces that should not coexist, yet here
          they were, bound together in a single object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just pure white, and unlike how the sword's body gave off a dark and
          dangerous vibe, the white hilt emitted a holy feeling and an
          unprecedented warmth.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if the hilt had its own separate life force, something
          ancient yet pure, standing in stark opposition to the malevolent
          energy of the blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt wrong, yet right—a weapon born of opposites, holding both
          salvation and destruction within its form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two energies seemed to pulse together, a strange harmony of chaos
          and order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tracing the white hilt with his fingers, it felt more like he was
          touching a piece of warm, smooth jade.
        </p>
        <p>
          The warmth spread from his fingertips, a comforting heat that traveled
          through his arm, in contrast to the cold, predatory sensation the
          blade exuded.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fingertips tingled slightly, the warmth from the hilt spreading
          through him, as though the sword was recognizing its new master.
        </p>
        <p>
          He moved the sword closer to him and felt a strong connection with it,
          resonating with his very being.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was more than just a weapon—it was a part of him, an extension of
          his will.
        </p>
        <p>Something that would grow with him from now on!</p>
        <p>
          It was as if the darkness of the sword was trying to swallow the space
          around it—the air seemed to tremble vividly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the light seemed to shy away from the weapon, bending around the
          blade's dark form as though afraid to come too close. The very stars
          above seemed dimmer, their faint glow unable to penetrate the sword's
          shadowy aura.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver couldn't help but take a deep breath as he took in the majesty
          of the sword. His chest swelled with both pride and awe, fully
          realizing the magnitude of what he had just created.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he felt a very strong resonance between his soul and
          the sword—a faint yet firm feeling. It wasn't just a tool; it was as
          if the sword had its own consciousness, one that mirrored his own in
          some way. It was as if they were two parts of a whole, bound by an
          unspoken understanding, their fates now one.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt the power of the sword. It was unimaginably powerful and
          terrifying! A raw force that could obliterate anything in its path if
          unleashed. The energy radiating from the blade was so intense it felt
          as though it could tear the very fabric of reality if unleashed.
        </p>
        <p>But something left him confused…</p>
        <p>Why was there a pure white hilt on this pitch-black sword?</p>
        <p>
          And instead of the eerie feeling the sword's entire body gave off,
          this white hilt instead gave him a holy and pure feeling! It was
          almost soothing, like the comforting presence of a divine being,
          completely at odds with the dark, destructive energy the sword
          radiated.
        </p>
        <p>Did he do something wrong?</p>
        <p>
          This was his first thought when he looked at it, but he discarded the
          notion. He had followed the exact steps and methods from his memory,
          so there was no way it was his fault.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything had been perfect—every line of the array, every grain of
          void dust placed with precision. There was no mistake.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, he simply put the matter to the back of his mind for the time
          being. He would figure it out when the time came naturally. There were
          greater concerns ahead, and whatever mystery the sword held would
          reveal itself in due time.
        </p>
        <p>
          He willed the sword to disappear, and in the next moment, it vanished
          into thin air, as if it had never existed in the first place. But only
          he knew the sword was close to him, closer than anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew the only distance between him and the sword was his call to
          it. The sword was bound to him now, a silent shadow that would follow
          him wherever he went, always ready, always waiting.
        </p>
        <p>
          After resting for a short time, he returned to the city, now fully
          prepared to complete his mission perfectly.
        </p>
        <p>
          His steps were lighter now, his body rejuvenated by the strange,
          potent energy that still lingered in his veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't go back to his hotel; instead, he headed toward the
          playground.
        </p>
        <p>
          The night's events had sharpened his focus, and there was no time to
          waste. The mission awaited.Nôv(el)B\\jnn

        <h2>Chapter 207 &nbsp;The two twisted minds! Revival?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 207</p>
        <p>City of Harlington, back alleyways.</p>
        <p>
          Just like any city in the world, the city of Harlington had its own
          slums and dirty alleys where criminals, thugs, or other anti-social
          elements resided or were active.
        </p>
        <p>
          The narrow, twisted streets seemed to swallow light, leaving only
          shadows where danger lurked at every corner.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air here was thick with the stench of decay and desperation, where
          the line between life and death was razor-thin.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smell of rotting garbage and filth permeated everything, mixing
          with the occasional distant wail of someone too far gone to be saved.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were often lawless zones where sometimes the cost of life became
          cheaper than a loaf of bread.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, morality was a luxury no one could afford, and a human life was
          traded like currency—cheap and easily spent.
        </p>
        <p>
          In these shadowy corners, power ruled, and mercy was a forgotten
          concept. The weak either learned to hide or were devoured by the
          strong, leaving nothing but bones and empty promises in their wake.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only the strong and skilled survived in such areas of poverty. And
          even the strong rarely survived without scars—physical and otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one of the old shabby houses, there was a moment of disturbance.
          The faint sound of wood creaking underfoot broke the stillness, a
          subtle shift in the oppressive silence. The house stood out even among
          the dilapidated surroundings, its broken windows and sagging roof a
          facade for something far more sinister within.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a place that seemed to sink into itself, as though the weight
          of the sins committed inside had made the very walls bow in despair.
        </p>

        <p>
          Inside the house, there wasn't much except for some cheap, old
          furniture. Dust-covered shelves and tattered curtains lined the walls,
          giving off the illusion of neglect—though the real activity lay just
          beneath the surface. The air was stale, thick with the scent of dust
          and mildew, though the real danger lay hidden beneath the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          An air of unease clung to the room, as if it was haunted by the
          malicious intentions of those who frequented it.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, this was all just a front—an artificial makeover to imitate
          the other houses in the alleyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dingy exterior and rundown appearance were carefully crafted to
          mislead prying eyes, ensuring no one looked too closely at what really
          went on behind closed doors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beneath the worn floorboards, the truth simmered, hidden from prying
          eyes. It was a trap—a facade hiding the dark web of schemes and plots
          brewing underneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under this shabby-looking facade, two people stood next to each other.
          One appeared to be holding a long piece of paper, while the other held
          a shiny rock.
        </p>
        <p>
          The paper was old and weathered, its edges frayed, but the writing
          upon it still pulsed with dark energy. The rock in the other's hand
          gleamed ominously, glowing faintly with power, as though alive in its
          own right.
        </p>
        <p>
          The dim light from a single flickering bulb cast long shadows across
          the room, giving the scene a sense of unease. The shadows seemed to
          dance along the cracked walls, their jagged edges crawling up toward
          the ceiling, twisting and contorting as if mimicking the thoughts of
          those present.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If we manage to do it this time, we will be even closer to our goal
          than before!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman's voice cut through the silence, sharp with anticipation.
          Her fingers trembled slightly as she gripped the paper, her excitement
          barely contained.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman's voice was filled with urgency, her eyes gleaming with
          ambition as she stared at the paper in her hands. The flickering light
          cast eerie reflections in her eyes, making her look almost feverish,
          consumed by the promise of what was to come.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the voice of a woman who spoke, indicating one of the two was a
          woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm. I'm sure we will. We've been delayed because of those bastards
          from the Unholy Sun Sect. Look what happened in the end? Now there's
          not a trace of their past glory." The man's voice was low, tinged with
          bitterness. He spat the words out, his grip tightening on the rock as
          if imagining it was one of the sect members.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Humph. They must have gotten too complacent with their new young
          recruits. Offending not one but all five major clans together at once?
          Even demons dare not pull such a stunt." Her lips curled into a sneer,
          her disdain for their recklessness clear.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no sympathy in her tone, only the cold satisfaction of
          seeing someone else's downfall.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know, I know… still, I feel it's a bit weird how they suddenly
          targeted the clan and got erased so easily. There must be a reason
          they directly reached out to attack the clan heirs." He furrowed his
          brow, suspicion creeping into his voice as he pondered the chain of
          events.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something about it felt off, as if there was a missing piece to the
          puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No use thinking about it. We don't need to concern ourselves with
          that matter; we have to do our job as told." Her voice was sharp,
          cutting off his train of thought.
        </p>
        <p>She had no interest in distractions, only in what lay ahead.</p>
        <p>
          "You're right. With the recent surge of exorcists around the normal
          human cities, security has tightened everywhere, and our actions have
          become even more restrained. Fortunately, we finally got this chance."
          The man spoke in a desperate tone. His hands tightened around the
          shiny rock, his knuckles white with tension.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's all thanks to those dumb idiots who went ahead and got
          themselves killed, making the clans actively hunt for heretics
          everywhere. Those exorcists are like mad dogs—once marked, they won't
          leave! Gosh, so annoying!" The woman spat the words out, her eyes
          flashing with irritation as she paced the room.
        </p>
        <p>The woman huffed in annoyance.</p>
        <p>
          "Well, don't stress too much. This city is still kind of backwater
          compared to others, and the people here have differing opinions on the
          existence of exorcists, so it shouldn't be a problem for us to fetch a
          high quantity of souls." The man's voice was calm, almost too calm, as
          if he'd already made peace with the chaos to come.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 208 &nbsp;Calling police?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 208</p>
        <p>The man assured her in a serious voice.</p>
        <p>
          The woman was silent upon hearing him and nodded. The tension in her
          shoulders eased slightly, though the fire in her eyes remained.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're right. I always feel baffled by the foolishness of these
          humans. To have opinions about exorcists? That's so ridiculous, haha!"
          Her laughter was sharp, edged with cruelty, her voice dripping with
          scorn.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man continued reading the scroll in his hands, as if lost in
          thought. His eyes flicked over the ancient symbols, each one sparking
          a new plan in his mind, his focus unshakable despite the woman's
          mocking tone.
        </p>
        <p>What he mentioned just now was a widely known fact.</p>
        <p>
          Not only did normal humans not have favorable impressions of
          exorcists, but it was also simply impossible for them to have one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some people refused to acknowledge that exorcists even existed. Those
          people were the ones who had never faced any danger and spent most of
          their lives in the confines of the highly secure, modern cities near
          the capital.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then there were those who felt the need to keep the exorcists in
          check, given the huge differences in power and mentality. To them,
          exorcists were too powerful, too separate from the normal human
          experience. They feared what they could not control.
        </p>
        <p>
          To such people, exorcists should be treated more as tools of war than
          humans, their sole purpose being to serve normal humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a ridiculous notion, but the Exorcist Union never bothered with
          it and continued doing what it wanted. Anyway, the majority of the
          population viewed the exorcists favorably, so it wasn't too big of an
          issue.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, who are we to care? Thanks to these fools, there isn't a single
          exorcist in the entire city. We've been planning this for well over a
          year by now. Once it's released, the entire city will become lambs
          ready for slaughter!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're right. Before the exorcists are even notified, we will have
          long accomplished our goal, hahaha." The woman let out an erratic
          laugh as she said this.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Ahh, I can't wait. With this number of souls, we can definitely
          revive our lord…"
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a glint of madness in his eyes as he spoke, his voice thick
          with obsession. The weight of their long-awaited moment hung heavy in
          the air, suffocating in its intensity.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man had a hint of longing in his words, and the woman remained
          silent, her eyes fervent with emotion. Her hands trembled ever so
          slightly, not from fear, but from the sheer adrenaline coursing
          through her veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had been planning this for a long time, keeping track of the city
          to ensure that no exorcists got a hint of their presence, or that if
          any passed by, they would leave without noticing anything abnormal.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only recently that they had become confident about their plans
          and reached the final stage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, the finishing touches were in place, and all that remained was
          the final, devastating blow.
        </p>
        <p>
          This did cause some problems with the common folk, but it was nothing
          too serious—just some nightmares and the disappearances of some
          insignificant people.
        </p>
        <p>
          People no one would miss. Faces forgotten by the world, swallowed by
          the dark alleys and backstreets of the city. In cities like these, the
          forgotten were the easiest prey. They disappeared without a trace,
          their existence barely acknowledged by the bustling lives of those in
          more prosperous areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          These incidents would at best be reported to the local authorities,
          and the police would soon forget about them as well. Just another name
          scrawled in a forgotten ledger, another case left cold. Another
          missing child, another nameless victim swallowed by the city's dark
          underbelly—just another day in the lawless parts of town.
        </p>
        <p>
          So they had been a little more aggressive lately. Time was running
          out, and the need to complete the ritual gnawed at their nerves. The
          sooner they completed the process, the sooner they could revive their
          lord and rebuild their sects.
        </p>
        <p>
          Desperation had driven them to take bolder risks, their movements more
          frantic with each passing day.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then it's about time we start?" The woman's voice cut through the
          tense silence, her eyes gleaming with anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed. It's time." The man's response was calm, but his voice held a
          note of grim finality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of them glanced at each other as the woman sat cross-legged in
          the room and closed her eyes as if meditating, while the man retrieved
          a broken skull from nowhere and placed it in front of her.
        </p>

        <p>
          The skull, cracked and ancient, seemed to pulse with a dark energy, as
          if it had a will of its own. Upon closer look, it had weird runes
          etched on the bony exterior.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man started to chant in some unknown language, and a runic array
          began to form beneath the skull.
        </p>
        <p>
          The symbols glowed faintly at first, but soon the room was bathed in a
          sinister light, the air around them thick with dark magic.
          n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>The two of them soon became immersed in their process.</p>
        <p>
          Their breaths synchronized with the rhythm of the chanting, each word
          spoken with purpose, as though unlocking something hidden deep beneath
          the surface.
        </p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, far from the sinister rituals taking place in the
          alleyways, Oliver had just arrived at the playground that was
          supposedly cursed. The air here felt heavy, thick with an unseen
          tension that made the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. He
          looked around. There were still some people there at that moment,
          parents chatting as their children played, blissfully unaware of the
          danger that lingered just beneath the surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made a quick call to the local police station, and soon someone
          picked up. The distant sound of the city faded as Oliver focused on
          the voice on the other end.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Harlington Police speaking, may we know your issue?" A feminine voice
          sounded from the other end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her tone was polite, but there was a hint of weariness—likely the
          result of dealing with countless routine calls.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver took a deep breath and said, his voice firm and authoritative
          completely unlike his usual self,
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am an exorcist dispatched by the Mystic Purge Clan and am currently
          in the city."

        <h2>Chapter 209 &nbsp;Evacuating civilians! Chief's surprise!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 209</p>
        <p>
          He heard some rustling sounds through the call before the voice came
          again. A quick shuffle, the urgency of the situation finally sinking
          in, as if the weight of his words had dropped like a stone into the
          calm waters of their routine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, sir exorcist, what can we assist you with?" This time, the voice
          had changed; it was that of a man. Clearly, the operator had
          immediately forwarded the call to her superior after hearing his
          claim.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a sharpness now, a readiness in the tone, as if the mention
          of "exorcist" had snapped the team into focus.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shift in tone was immediate, from casual to tense, as if the very
          word "exorcist" had sent a jolt of realization through the station.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man on the other end was no longer speaking to just anyone; he was
          talking to a member of one of the most feared and respected groups in
          existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was a bit reckless to suddenly trust the other party based
          on a call alone, only a few dared to joke about such matters, and the
          punishment for pranksters was severe.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one, not even the most brazen of criminals, would dare impersonate
          an exorcist and risk the wrath of the clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one took an exorcist lightly, especially not in times like these.
          There were too many dark forces lurking just beyond the light of
          civilization, too many dangers that only exorcists could face head-on.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come over and clear the playground in the north. Have all the
          civilians evacuate the premises right now. I am about to perform an
          exorcism."
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice remained calm, but there was an underlying urgency in his
          words, a subtle command that brooked no argument.
        </p>

        <p>An exorcism!</p>
        <p>
          The police chief on the other end of the call, upon hearing the word,
          had a tense expression. His heartbeat quickened, his grip on the phone
          tightening as if the very word had sent a chill down his spine. His
          heart skipped a beat, and he looked a bit dazed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew what it meant when an exorcist was about to perform an
          exorcism somewhere—it meant the place was infested either with demonic
          beings like ghosts or something related to heretics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both possibilities were equally terrifying. Demons could tear apart
          the very city itself, and heretics… well, they had a way of twisting
          the world around them into something unrecognizable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both were threats that no normal police force was equipped to handle.
          They could barely deal with regular criminals, let alone the
          supernatural horrors that exorcists faced daily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being on the deeper side of the human continent, there was no way a
          ghost could sneak past, so it only meant one simple thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Heretics. The word echoed in his mind like the tolling of a funeral
          bell.
        </p>
        <p>There were heretics in the city! Nôv(el)B\\jnn</p>
        <p>
          The realization hit him like a punch to the gut. It was the kind of
          news that could shake an entire city to its core. And since an
          exorcist deemed it necessary to take action and personally perform an
          exorcism, it could only mean that the heretics had been active in the
          city for a long time, operating under their noses.
        </p>
        <p>
          His stomach churned. His mind raced as he tried to comprehend how
          something so dangerous had slipped past them unnoticed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had reached the point where an exorcism was needed to keep the
          people safe. That meant the threat was already far greater than they
          had ever anticipated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The gravity of the situation settled in, a cold sweat breaking out
          across his brow.
        </p>
        <p>
          His expression turned grim as he realized the playground in the north…
          The place where families gathered, where children played—blissfully
          unaware of the darkness creeping toward them.
        </p>

        <p>
          The department had received some reports from there recently about
          abnormal activities and mysterious disappearances of children.
        </p>
        <p>
          Missing posters had been plastered around the city, but no one had
          connected the dots—until now.
        </p>
        <p>
          But they had concluded it was a missing persons case, and some
          officers were investigating it. Standard protocol for a city like
          Harlington—chalk it up to runaway kids or unsolved abductions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who could have thought it was related to heretics? The realization
          burned in his chest like acid. They had been blind to the real danger
          all along.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this matter came to public light, his position would be in grave
          danger. The city's trust in his leadership would crumble. He could
          already see the headlines—his career in ruins.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you still there? Reply."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's cold voice sounded from the other end since the chief officer
          had not replied. It cut through the chief's rising panic like a blade,
          snapping him back to the present.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, yes, sir. I will personally mobilize every available personnel
          and come to your aid right now." The chief's voice wavered, but he
          forced strength into it, knowing this wasn't the time for hesitation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fast," Oliver said and hung up the phone. The abrupt end to the call
          left the chief staring at the receiver, the weight of the command
          still hanging in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chief held his face for a moment, feeling frustrated. His fingers
          pressed into his temples, trying to massage away the anxiety building
          inside. No matter what, since an exorcist had called for assistance,
          as per the laws and conduct of human society, they must aid them to
          the best of their ability.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no room to think about other things now. The clock was
          ticking, and lives were on the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was shocked how he, an experienced officer was panicking so much
          right now? Where did all that training to remain calm in such
          situations go?
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help it since the topic related to heretics and demons
          made even the bravest sweat cold buckets.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly ordered his force to be ready and rushed to the location
          where Oliver was. The sirens blared as police cars sped through the
          city streets, a sense of dread filling the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          They quickly reached the scene and immediately started escorting the
          citizens still loitering around in the park out.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were a few homeless beggars hiding under benches and other
          places; they were directly removed from the park. Even the most
          stubborn were pulled away, their protests drowned out by the urgency
          in the officers' voices.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 210 &nbsp;He's short!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 210</p>
        <p>
          They were under orders that no one was to see what was about to happen
          and that they must maintain a distance from the playground and park.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever was about to unfold here was beyond anything they were
          equipped to handle. The officers had felt it in their bones—a primal
          instinct to retreat, to leave this business to those who could face
          such horrors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the officers on duty didn't dare linger for too long after
          ensuring there was no one left in the playground. The unnatural quiet
          that followed sent a shiver down their spines. They didn't need to be
          told twice to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wasn't a horror movie, and they weren't main characters. They
          were simply ordinary people trying to survive in a world filled with
          extraordinary threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter what, they were still ordinary folk and could not withstand
          demonic beings on their own. They weren't armed with holy relics or
          mystical abilities—just badges and uniforms. They didn't have the
          confidence to deal with such supernatural phenomena.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had seen enough reports to know that when an exorcist was
          involved, it was best to get as far away as possible. Exorcists didn't
          just deal with criminals—they dealt with things that could tear your
          mind apart, or worse, your soul.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was nowhere to be seen, which led to some confusion. The police
          chief at the scene couldn't help but call him back, to which he simply
          replied that they should not bother him anymore and evacuate
          themselves as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chief was restless, however. His nerves were on edge, a low hum of
          anxiety vibrating through his body. His hands twitched at his sides,
          his instincts screaming at him to stay. Being the person with the
          highest authority in the area, he had the responsibility to stay back
          and assist if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, he ordered his subordinates to leave first and maintain a distance
          from the playground, prohibiting any citizens from wandering close to
          it. Their hurried footsteps echoed in the empty streets as they rushed
          to comply, eager to put distance between themselves and whatever was
          about to happen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Only he remained near the playground, waiting for the exorcist to
          appear. He still had to ensure that the caller was authentic by
          meeting Oliver in person—otherwise, wouldn't they have wasted all
          their efforts and time?
        </p>
        <p>
          Minutes stretched into eternity as the police chief was feeling more
          uneasy, he spotted a small, lone figure walking toward him. The figure
          moved with purpose, a silhouette too small and deliberate to be one of
          the wandering homeless.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silhouette indicated they were just a small child. But how could a
          kid slip past the guard of his subordinates and enter without them
          noticing?
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind scrambled for a logical explanation, but nothing made sense.
          Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, he felt inclined to believe the identity of the other
          person was what he expected. Still, doubt gnawed at the edges of his
          thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Could this really be the exorcist he had spoken to? The one who
          claimed to be capable of performing an exorcism so dangerous?
        </p>
        <p>"Who are you? Didn't I ask everyone to leave?"</p>
        <p>
          The child-like voice was undoubtedly present. The boy's features came
          into the light—creamy white hair and brightly shining blue eyes. He
          was, without a doubt, a kid.
        </p>
        <p>An extraordinary kid…</p>
        <p>
          The chief's breath hitched. The police chief could just tell. There
          was something about the way the boy stood, the way his eyes seemed to
          take in everything with a calm indifference. The intensity around
          Oliver made him instinctively feel that way. Despite the other party
          being a small child with a harmless appearance, the chief still felt
          oddly vulnerable, as if standing in front of a predator.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was something predatory about the way the boy carried himself,
          as if beneath that innocent face was something far older, far more
          dangerous. The chief felt as though he was staring into the eyes of a
          creature that had seen more than a lifetime's worth of battle,
          someone—or something—who knew the darkest corners of the world.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Sir, are you the exorcist…?" He mustered up his courage and asked.
          His throat tightened as the words left his mouth, the question hanging
          in the air between them like a weight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded. His movement was so small, so restrained, it barely
          registered.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Didn't we just talk about it?" His response was flat, emotionless,
          but carried with it a weight of authority that left no room for doubt.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, definitely. It's just that there haven't been any exorcists in
          this city for many years, and I always imagined exorcists to be… erm…
          nothing, sir." The chief's words fumbled out awkwardly, his mind still
          grappling with the contradiction before him—this childlike figure, and
          the immense power he could sense underneath.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chief's words stumbled out awkwardly, the sight before him
          clashing with everything he'd ever thought an exorcist would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chief didn't know what to say to him, so he paused hesitantly
          mid-sentence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was it offensive to point out the child-like features? It wasn't just
          the strangeness of seeing a kid in this role—it was the sheer
          disconnect between what he expected and what was standing in front of
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wasn't sure what the protocol was in this situation, but he sure as
          hell didn't want to offend the boy standing before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was contemplating if it would be offensive to comment on the
          child-like features. As an ordinary human, he was not familiar with
          exorcist customs.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he mistakenly offended the exorcist, he would only be sowing
          unnecessary trouble, which he clearly didn't want to do. The tales of
          those who had insulted or crossed exorcists lingered in the back of
          his mind—none of them ended well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moreover, it could be that the other party was in disguise. With the
          strange and bizarre methods of the exorcists, he wouldn't be surprised
          if there was an old man under the child's skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver glanced at the restless officer and knew what he was thinking.
          He was not unfamiliar with such glances; during the auction, there
          were multiple people who had doubted and tried to confirm his
          identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was helpless in this matter and could only wait to grow quickly.
