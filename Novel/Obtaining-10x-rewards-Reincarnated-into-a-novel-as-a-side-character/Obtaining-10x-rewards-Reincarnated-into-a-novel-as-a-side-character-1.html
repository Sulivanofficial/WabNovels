        <h2>Chapter 11: Exorcist's source of power</h2>
        <p>Chapter 11</p>
        <p>
          He properly seasoned the fish before giving it to the cat also so that
          she won't mind too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          How could he know that the clan guardian had tasted delicacies that he
          could never imagine and he just gave her a leftover fish which was
          another great humiliation to the entity.
        </p>
        <p>But what could it do?</p>
        <p>
          Tell him about it and expose her secret? She had come in the disguise
          of a normal cat to observe Oliver more closely so she cannot do that.
        </p>
        <p>All she could do was accept the fish.</p>
        <p>
          It was surely not due to the fact that the fish looked quite
          delicious.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Damn it! This kid is too much. Nom. Nom. If this fish was bad, I
          would have had him executed publicly.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian quietly munched off the fish and rested outside for
          the night, it would try again the next day.
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>Soon, it was morning and Oliver felt more refreshed than ever.</p>
        <p>
          His eyes were now relaxed and he felt his sense of vision was
          amplified hundredfold.
        </p>

        <p>
          One thing to know was that he was visually-handicapped in his previous
          life so for him to see things so clearly was a pleasant experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          After taking a bath, he moved towards the mirror to comb his short
          hair but he saw something wonderous instead.
        </p>
        <p>His eyes... their color had changed. They had mutated!</p>
        <p>
          Earlier, he had deep purple colored eyes but now the color had changed
          completely, instead of just being a shade of amethyst, there were some
          other colors as well, red, black, a bit white.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not only that, with his enhanced sight, he could see a complex
          pattern in the middle of his iris, he felt dizzy just glancing at the
          pattern.
        </p>
        <p>
          He dared not to stare at it too much lest it drained all his mental
          power. He believed it had something to do with the Cosmic Void Gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention, he felt a mysterious charm in those eyes, they
          were beautiful and awing to look at. It was as if he was looking at a
          piece of beautiful invaluable art.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a dangerous feeling, he wanted to just keep staring in the
          mirror at himself...
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head to distract himself and quickly combed his hair and
          left his room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside, he saw the clan guardian napping peacefully on a grassy
          patch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps sensing his presence, the cat woke up and ran up to him
          meowing at him pitifully.
        </p>
        <p>He scoffed, the clan guardian was really good at acting.</p>
        <p>
          Did she think that last night he had felt pity for her and let her
          stay?
        </p>
        <p>
          If so, then it was good. He no longer intended to offend her. She was
          an ancient monster that should not be provoked in the early stages of
          the plot.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite her harmless appearance of a white cat, she was way darker
          than a demon inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Looks can be deceiving indeed.' Oliver nodded to himself, in the
          novel, there were many wolves in sheep's skin that he had to be
          careful of in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you want me to adopt you?" Oliver looked at her and asked the
          obvious.
        </p>
        <p>The cat furiously nodded, which made his expression weird.</p>
        <p>
          'Do you not realize that by nodding your head, you're technically
          telling me that you can understand human tongue and are definitely not
          an ordinary cat.'
        </p>
        <p>He felt that perhaps the clan guardian had grown senile.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, he had made some arrangements beforehand.</p>
        <p>"Alright, I will own you from now on."</p>
        <p>"Meow!" The cat jumped happily.</p>
        <p>'Finally, I succeeded.'</p>
        <p>"Then I will need a name for you. How does 'socks' sound?"</p>
        <p>Oliver sucked at naming so whatever came to his mind, he spat.</p>
        <p>
          'Socks? Are you kidding me!? I know that I have the same color as your
          socks but still how the fuck do I look like a sock!?'
        </p>
        <p>She growled at him making him rethink his decision.</p>

        <p>"Huh. This is tough. How about zippy?"</p>
        <p>
          He thought for a moment and remembered that a stray dog from his past
          life was also called zippy in the neighborhood so he said that.
        </p>
        <p>Seeing the cat was satisfied, he nodded.</p>
        <p>
          Now that everything was settled, he let the cat enter his house and
          took out a fluffy cushion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Zippy, the clan guardian who had been named thought it was supposed to
          be her seat and was about to sit on it when she saw Oliver sit on it.
        </p>
        <p>"...."</p>
        <p>
          "Huh? What are you looking at? Is there a rat in the house?" He looked
          around confusedly but found nothing odd.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, he ignored her and assumed a meditative posture, feeling
          the espera around him, he tried to draw in the espera towards him but
          the flow was pathetic.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if only 1 particle out of 200 entered him.</p>
        <p>
          'It's no use, unless I obtain an inherent talent from Nadia, I can not
          try this. And for that, I would need to wait for her to make a
          milestone in her espera training. Well, it should be coming soon if we
          follow the novel's plot.'
        </p>
        <p>He grinned to himself not minding the weird stares of the cat.</p>
        <p>
          'What is this kid doing? His flow is so pathetic... I can't believe
          someone from our main lineage could be born this lacking... then what
          was that ominous power from before? It can't be that I was mistaken. I
          can smell it on him.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Zippy was confused at him. She thought of some treasures that she had
          which might help him raise his potential slightly but they were too
          precious and there was no guarantee that he would obtain a great
          talent after consuming them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So she just laid down and watched him do his things. If he really
          could not achieve anything in the end, she would feed it to him and
          then test out her doubts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Something was better than nothing after all plus she had no need for
          those treasures herself.
        </p>
        <p>Knock! Knock!</p>
        <p>"Young master, it is time for your lessons."</p>
        <p>
          A cold voice sounded from the other side of the door, it was his maid
          who often came to deliver food and recite his schedules.
        </p>
        <p>"Alright, send the teacher, I will be ready shortly."</p>

        <h2>
          Chapter 12: Nurturing the target to get stronger! Finding treasures
        </h2>
        <p>Chapter 12</p>
        <p>
          After taking his routine lessons, he was once again free, the cat had
          wandered off to somewhere so Oliver did not care much.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then..." Stretching his arms, he looked at the sky with a
          thoughtful gaze.
        </p>
        <p>"I should probably help Nadia achieve a milestone."</p>
        <p>
          Indeed, after much contemplation, he had arrived at the conclusion
          that the faster he would help her grow her strength, the stronger he
          would become as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          So instead of lazing around in the courtyard all day which was a bad
          habit, he decided to do what he could at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although, his scope of operations was limited to the Mystic Purge
          Clan, there were still some things hidden here and there in the clan
          which he could potentially obtain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the original novel, those items were usually obtained by some minor
          characters, so he thought that he might as well give them to Nadia to
          increase her power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyways, they were just some booster items he could spend on her for
          growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had decided that rather than just sitting idly, he would help the
          main characters grow so he can obtain more benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If I know from the novel correctly, near the oak tree at the western
          area of the clan, there should be a huge rock, and 29 steps away from
          it just beneath the ground should be something that could greatly
          benefit Nadia."
        </p>

        <p>
          He quickly finished his business and went out towards the western part
          of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan was a huge place, it was not an exaggeration to claim that
          their clan was no smaller than a city itself, just that it was
          secluded and not many people knew the exact location of this place.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan had everything one could need, it was a self-functioning city
          in itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The town was divided into regions; east, west, north, south and
          central parts.
        </p>
        <p>
          From tall and traditional styled houses to shops selling weapons and
          food, everything was properly arranged in the town.
        </p>
        <p>
          The central area was the place where his father, mother and rest of
          the siblings lived, along with them, the important elders or the
          important individuals also resided there.
        </p>
        <p>
          His house was located in the east, just a little away from the central
          area, this was also probably why that most people were unaware of his
          existence.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed, the world was really cruel but his family was even more, he
          was mature by mind so he did not care but had it been a real child...
          to be isolated like that from their family, it would have severely
          affected their psyche.
        </p>
        <p>Anyways, his goal for the day was the western area of the clan.</p>
        <p>
          He quietly left his courtyard and after an hour of travelling, he
          directly reached the specified spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          He received a few strange gazes on his way, probably due to his
          symbolic white hair but he ignored them naturally.
        </p>
        <p>Pat Pat</p>

        <p>"It should be around here."</p>
        <p>
          He kicked the ground with his feet and measured exact 29 steps from
          the rock near the Oak tree, it was an unimpressive spot that no one
          really cared about.
        </p>
        <p>
          To think, there would be a treasure item hidden just beneath this
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and retrieved a shovel he had brought along him and
          started digging into the spot.
        </p>
        <p>It did not take him long before he felt some resistance.</p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>"That's it!"</p>
        <p>
          He threw the shovel away and used his hands to clean the dirt and soil
          away from the metallic box.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a small and ordinary looking gray metal box, however, the box
          gave off an ancient vibe upon looking.
        </p>
        <p>"Body strengthening elixir... this is great stuff."</p>
        <p>His eyes shone as he inspected the contents of the metal box.</p>
        <p>
          Elixirs were potions that upon being consumed provided the person with
          a permanent advantage in their aspects.
        </p>

        <p>
          Elixirs were a rarity and countless alchemists worked daily to produce
          one. Yet, it was not an easy feat to be achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Only master alchemists with a fine control over espera and excellent
          dexterity could dare to produce them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And each Elixir once produced was sold at sky-high prices in the
          market. The art of potion-crafting was ancient and was strictly
          regulated by the clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in his clan that had multiple strong Alchemists, an elixir was
          still a rare item to be obtained and people would send endlessly to
          get their hands on one.
        </p>
        <p>
          The advantage was too great after all, who would dare to reject a
          permanent boost in their abilities, if someone was lucky enough, they
          might even awaken new powers through consumption.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a world of demons and wars, for a hunter, such a things was
          priceless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alchemists were highly respected for this reason alone, they were
          known for their ability to produce miracles.
        </p>
        <p>
          This potion in his hands was also probably the work of some ancient
          alchemist of the clan who might have hidden it for some purpose or
          just leave it as an inheritance for their future generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, their family either did not continue or this precious
          item was lost by them. Whatever it was, now it belonged to him.
        </p>
        <p>"No it belongs to Nadia."</p>
        <p>
          He laughed and went back with the box, it had been some time since he
          last met her and he was quite curious how she will react after seeing
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          'She should not attack me like last time probably, I made sure to
          leave a positive impression on her last time after all.'
        </p>
        <p>
          With that thought, he went back to his courtyard first and stored the
          metal box somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elixir was inside a long glass tube and was radiating a shiny and
          sparkly bluish color. It was quite beautiful to look at, one of the
          features of an elixir.
        </p>
        <p>He carefully stored the elixir in the pocket of Yukata.</p>
        <p>
          That's right, the culture that his clan followed seemed to be closely
          tied with the Japanese culture in his previous world...
        </p>
        <p>
          Although now that the world had become plagued with wars and demons,
          the concept of countries and boundaries was now vague and everything
          where humans lived was considered a human territory that was under the
          rule of one of the 5 clans.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 13: Meeting the other siblings. Cruel brats!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 13</p>
        <p>
          He made a trip to the central area of the clan once again, he was no
          longer restricted to his courtyard anymore and was allowed to move
          around.
        </p>
        <p>
          But when he entered the central area, he felt a chill on his back, it
          was as if he was being observed by countless eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          He discreetly tried to look around and found that people were minding
          their own business, not exactly paying him attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          'No they are definitely observing me through some means or it could be
          the hidden guards in the area watching me... earlier, when I visited
          the central area, I did not feel anything but now after awakening the
          special eyes, I can feel them.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He instinctively felt the urge to use his special eyes to counter but
          refrained, he dared not to show anything lest he was taken directly to
          his mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made up his mind and ignored the hidden gazes and moved along the
          street towards the courtyard of his sister, Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was still some distance away, it should take him around 20 minutes
          to reach by walking.
        </p>
        <p>
          He exhaled slightly, his entire body was tense from the feeling of
          someone constantly watching his every step, he could not help but lose
          focus again and again.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was very irritating, he wished that they could leave him alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          'It is as if I am some sort of enemy of theirs that they must keep
          watch on...'
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver annoyedly thought as he kept moving forward, he was already in
          the central area of the town, and all around of him were tall houses
          with entrances to the courtyards of important people of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he walked deeper, the amount of people became less and less,
          signifying the importance level.
        </p>
        <p>"And that's how I defeated them, brother...."</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, Oliver's ears picked some noises from ahead as he raised his
          head, and narrowed his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a group of people walking his way, they all seemed to be
          older than him, all of them were wearing traditional Yukatas, from
          just one glance at their clothes, anyone could tell they were lavish.
        </p>
        <p>They were much better than Oliver's plain cloth.</p>
        <p>'No way, why do I keep encountering troubles...'</p>
        <p>Oliver's mouth twitched.</p>
        <p>
          He quickly recognized them to be his older siblings, they were his two
          older brothers, the 2nd and 3rd oldest sons along with the 3rd oldest
          daughter of the family.
        </p>
        <p>
          They seemed to be walking out to somewhere and he just happened to
          bump into them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although there was not much info about these side-characters, but from
          the nature of the clan and their upbringing, he was sure that they all
          must be trash among trashes.
        </p>
        <p>'Pretend I didn't see them...'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver tried to lower his presence, as much as he could try to do so,
          he hoped that they will just ignore him as a passerby and he could
          reach his destination.
        </p>

        <p>
          Last time, he did not encounter any troubles at all but this time, he
          was met with all annoying things, from hidden guards to these siblings
          of his.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey, who are you?"</p>
        <p>
          A voice sounded from behind Oliver making him feel goosebumps all over
          his skin. He immediately turned around to see the 3rd oldest brother
          of his looking down at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just one moment ago, they were in front of him and now they were
          behind him.
        </p>
        <p>This level of speed was terrifying!</p>
        <p>
          "This area and beyond is only accessible to direct family members of
          Mystic Purge Clan, don't you know?" The older boy commented in a plain
          tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          'There was something like this as well!?' Oliver exclaimed. Sure
          enough, this seemed possible in such a huge clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm? Shane, look at his hair, why does he have the same hair color as
          mother?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The third miss of the clan also came near and observed his features as
          she asked her twin brother, the one who had approached Oliver the
          first.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, white haired people were only the direct family members of
          the clan, it was not that they all hair white hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since Ophelia had white hair and majority of children inherited
          her hair so they were known by their hair color throughout the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now that you mention it... he does share the same hair color, but I
          can't recognize him though?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The oldest of the three also came forward and now Oliver was
          surrounded by them.
        </p>

        <p>
          All 3 of them gave a strong pressure, it was as if he was surrounded
          by 3 ferocious beasts in the jungle.
        </p>
        <p>"I will ask again, who are you?"</p>
        <p>
          'What do I say...? It's better to be truthful here, it's not like I
          did something offensive that they will hurt me, right?'
        </p>
        <p>With that thought in his mind, he calmly replied.</p>
        <p>"I am Oliver, Oliver Mystic, the fourth son..."</p>
        <p>
          Before he could continue, a powerful slap connected to his right
          cheek, the force sent him throwing backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cough-!" Oliver coughed out blood, the inner skin of his cheek was
          peeled by the force as blood filled his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How dare you say yourself to be a Mystic with that miniscule amount
          of strength, are you looking to die?"
        </p>
        <p>The third miss was the one who had sent him throwing.</p>
        <p>
          She coldly looked down at him. For some reason, looking at his face
          reminded her of someone strong so she could not help but be pissed and
          attack him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not believe that he was their sibling at all, every single
          member bearing the blood of the Mystic clan's direct lineage was a
          living legend and so were their descendants.
        </p>
        <p>
          A weakling had no place in their family and Oliver was the exact
          definition of weak.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could sense that he barely had any espera inside him, it could not
          be possible that he had so much espera in his body that she could not
          sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, there were only two cases where either the person's espera
          level was too high or too low that one cannot sense it.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the looks, Oliver was younger than them and therefore it was
          impossible for him to surpass them in espera quantity unless he was
          some exception genius which he clearly wasn't or else they would have
          known of such a sibling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Impersonation of the direct family members of the Mystic Clan was a
          serious crime and demanded on spot execution.
        </p>
        <p>"Get up and explain yourself."</p>
        <p>
          A condescending voice echoes above Oliver as he slowly looked at them.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 14: Getting beaten! But they retreat?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 14</p>
        <p>"Get up."</p>
        <p>Shane also joined her and ordered him to stand back.</p>
        <p>"Who are you? And why are you here?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver slowly raised his head as he tried to get up, only to receive a
          strong blow to his abdomen.
        </p>
        <p>Shane had just kicked him in the stomach.</p>
        <p>"Ugh-! Cough-!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver once again crashed into the wall; he felt as if the air was
          sucked out of his lungs. The kick was very strong.
        </p>
        <p>"I- Cough! Cough-!"</p>
        <p>
          He was not even allowed to speak before he was thrown over again by
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Weakly, he looked at them only to see devious smirks on their faces.
          It was at that moment he realized something.
        </p>
        <p>
          They did not care whether he was genuine or not; they wanted to beat
          him to death for their fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were enjoying the process of beating him again and again as he
          tried to get up and explain.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were both sadists; no, the entire family was a bunch of cruel
          psychotic sadists.
        </p>

        <p>
          He realized this. In the novel, it was especially mentioned the clan's
          alignment and nature. The Mystic Purge Clan was dark, and people from
          this clan harbored sadistic tendencies. It was due to the way they
          were raised since birth that their mental state was bent towards
          torture and death.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had not seen such a nature in Nadia last time and had ignored the
          fact as such. When he saw her cry pitifully last time, he was placed
          under the illusion that all was good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Who knows that he might not have seen her true nature yet? She might
          not have shown her true self last time...
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned as he felt a sharp pain in his arm; it was as if his bone
          had been dislocated.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had not intended to listen to him since the beginning; he was
          already a target for them the moment they spotted him and saw his
          weakness.
        </p>
        <p>Bam! Bam!</p>
        <p>
          In the next few minutes, the quiet surroundings of the road were
          filled with bashing and slamming sounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if someone was hitting a wall with iron pipes or using a
          punching sandbag.
        </p>
        <p>
          While this was the sound of Oliver being beaten, at the moment, his
          state was quite serious. He was bleeding from several areas of his
          body, and one of his arms was twisted backwards.
        </p>
        <p>
          His legs were bent, and his smooth and fair face was filled with scars
          and bruises.
        </p>
        <p>
          In front of him were Shane and his twin sister, the 3rd miss, as he
          laid on the marbled ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          They both had flushed expressions and were panting slightly, as if
          aroused from the scene in front of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, on the other hand, was miserable. He tried to squint his eyes
          but couldn't; hot tears had filled his eyes, blurring his view as he
          looked at the clouds in the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to his condition, his mind didn't eve think of using the special
          eyes to stop them... he had yet to get accustomed to his special eyes
          so that his brain could use them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The oldest of them had not moved from his spot since the beginning; he
          seemed uninterested and just observed from the side.
        </p>
        <p>He could not care less if a weakling or two died.</p>

        <p>
          "Finish your thing; we have somewhere we need to be, so don't waste
          time."
        </p>
        <p>
          His cold voice served as a reminder for the two siblings as they
          glanced at one another.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will finish him off. Also, Shane, don't forget to remind the guards
          to not let weaklings like him ever step foot in here."
        </p>
        <p>
          She said as she glanced at thin air as if she could see all the hidden
          guards watching them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane just nodded as he watched excitedly his sister finish off the
          boy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as she was about to land the final blow, a chilling voice
          interrupted everyone.
        </p>
        <p>"What are you doing?"</p>
        <p>The voice was icy cold, seemingly devoid of any emotion at all.</p>
        <p>
          Everyone present felt the temperature drop by a few degrees instantly,
          and they could not help but look at the source of the voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          With silvery-white hair floating against the wind, cold amethyst eyes,
          and an emotionless expression on her face, Nadia was standing just a
          few meters away from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what shocked them the most was that none of them could sense her
          approaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all instantly recognized her, Nadia, the monstrous genius of the
          clan and the possible next matriarch of the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all sucked in a cold breath when they saw her; she was famous for
          being a ruthless, cold-hearted witch.
        </p>
        <p>
          From excellent academics to near-perfect exorcism abilities, she was
          someone they could not hope to reach.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that moment when they were asked a question by her, none of them
          was able to speak a word.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the oldest of them all mustered some confidence and moved
          forward to speak.
        </p>

        <p>
          "We were just... taking care of a pest that seemed to have sneaked in
          this haven... haha..."
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though he was older and stronger, he still felt plenty nervous at
          the moment.
        </p>
        <p>In terms of talent, Nadia far surpassed any of them.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia listened to them and glanced at the almost broken Oliver; she
          looked at him for a moment, observing his injuries.
        </p>
        <p>She... felt nothing.</p>
        <p>For a moment, she seemed disappointed but nothing more.</p>
        <p>
          Then she glanced at her siblings and saw their faces etched with silly
          and nervous smiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was indeed the reaction she expected from them. They were, after
          all, inferior.
        </p>
        <p>"Leave."</p>
        <p>
          One word was all she said, and the faces of the siblings changed
          instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all understood what she meant; apart from Oliver, everyone was to
          scram right at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>Her word was like a command rather than a request.</p>
        <p>
          Shane and his twin sister were unsure; they did not dare to offend
          Nadia and waited for their older brother to decide.
        </p>
        <p>
          The older brother in question also had a flushed face; Nadia's command
          was an insult to him. He was older than her but was treated as such.
        </p>
        <p>"Don't go too far, Nadia. I am the olderâ"</p>
        <p>
          He could not even finish his sentence before he retreated ten steps
          back quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand went to his face; a fresh cut was formed on his cheek that
          started leaking blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes had a trace of fear; he almost could not catch up to her
          movements, and she had already managed to harm him.
        </p>
        <p>This was the difference in their abilities.</p>
        <p>"I will leave."</p>
        <p>
          He quickly knew that any further confrontation would only be a
          disaster, so he tactfully surrendered.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 15: Giving the elixir to Nadia. Complex emotions.</h2>
        <p>Chapter 15</p>
        <p>"I will leave."</p>
        <p>
          He quickly realized that any further confrontation would only result
          in disaster, so he tactfully surrendered.
        </p>
        <p>
          But before leaving, he glanced at the half-dead Oliver with a fierce
          glint in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>He had some thoughts at the moment that no one else knew about.</p>
        <p>
          After the trio left, Nadia slowly walked up to the unconscious Oliver
          and crouched down, observing his bruised face.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at the sky, and her eyes shone in a strange color. In the
          next moment, all the hidden eyes suddenly left their vicinity, leaving
          the two alone.
        </p>
        <p>This was her authority!</p>
        <p>
          "With this, we are even," Nadia said as she took out a small glass
          tube carrying a green liquid and slowly poured its contents into
          Oliver's mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched as the injuries on his body quickly started to recover at
          a tremendous speed, and in a minute, he was fully back from his
          half-dead state from before.
        </p>
        <p>"Cough... Cough..."</p>
        <p>
          With a few coughs, he suddenly inhaled a large amount of air as his
          eyes opened wide.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly sat up and saw Nadia looking at him with no particular
          emotion.
        </p>

        <p>"We should be even with this," she said as she got up.</p>
        <p>
          "My injuries are all gone? Did she use a healing potion on me?" he
          wondered as he touched his face and felt his smooth skin once again,
          indicating a full recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am saved..." He felt weak from inside; he had never been beaten so
          badly in his two lifetimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time he was being beaten, he felt death closely... he was
          scared... and powerless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a burst of rage surged from within him. He should have used
          his special eyes on them at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But upon further thought, he believed that it was a good decision that
          he did not use them; the entire area was surrounded by hidden guards
          making note of everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two, he still did not have the appropriate mastery over them... and
          third, he was beaten so fast that his brain could not process even to
          think of using them as a means to save himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This all suggested that he still did not have enough experience in
          using his special eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt like a retard; even after having such great power in his
          hands, he still got beaten up?
        </p>
        <p>What was the use even after all this?</p>
        <p>
          He shifted his thoughts away as he saw Nadia walking away, back to her
          courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>He quickly followed after her.</p>
        <p>"What?" she paused and looked back, her eyes still cold as ice.</p>
        <p>
          "Wait a moment, Nadia. Originally, I came here to give you something,
          so take that before you leave."
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver also did not want to stay there anymore; he quickly wanted to
          go back to his courtyard, form a revenge plan, and rest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had decided that the trio from before were as good as dead from
          this moment forth.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia furrowed her brows. He came here to give her something?</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, her heart rate accelerated as she watched him take out a
          blue glass tube from his pocket.
        </p>
        <p>An Elixir!</p>
        <p>A body-strengthening elixir!</p>
        <p>
          Her heartbeat suddenly quickened; she didn't know why, but looking at
          him taking out a body-strengthening elixir made her feel itchy in the
          chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          No, it was not because of the body-strengthening elixir; she could
          have gotten one for herself if she had asked from the clan.
        </p>
        <p>It was due to something else...</p>
        <p>
          It was because of the fact that he had come all the way here to give
          this elixir to her.
        </p>
        <p>Why?</p>
        <p>
          She opened her mouth, but no words seemed to come out at the moment;
          she seemed to want to say something but could not speak...
        </p>
        <p>'Why can't I speak?'</p>
        <p>
          She asked herself. She wanted to interrogate him about how he found
          this precious thing...
        </p>

        <p>
          She felt as if there was a lump in her throat prohibiting her from
          speaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had come here to give her an elixir and was almost beaten to death.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew the rarity of an elixir; although she could easily get one
          from the clan, it did not mean that they were not precious. She knew
          that even her siblings would need to spend many resources to obtain
          one of the elixirs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Logically speaking, if by any chance, he got his hands on an elixir,
          it should be obvious for him to use it on himself rather than give it
          to someone else.
        </p>
        <p>Wasn't he much weaker than her?</p>
        <p>
          This was so foolish... she wanted to be disappointed at his lack of
          intellect but found it hard for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, her heart rate increased, and her face felt hot for some
          reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was feeling a sudden burst of unknown emotions; she did not know
          what was happening...
        </p>
        <p>'Suppress.'</p>
        <p>
          She tried to suppress the loud beating of her heart; she did not want
          him to accidentally hear her loud heartbeat. It would be a great blow
          to her pride if that happened.
        </p>
        <p>She was shocked once again that she could not calm herself down.</p>
        <p>
          This feeling... it was the same as that time when she cried for the
          first time, and it happened in front of him at that time too.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had thought that she had grown up after that shameful incident
          last time and has increased her mental resistance as well...
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not understand what he did that always made her lose herself;
          she would never act or behave like this whenever she was around
          others, but now...
        </p>
        <p>And why was it that it always was him?</p>
        <p>
          Didn't her mother also provide her with extremely precious and rare
          resources all the time? So why did she not feel like this for her
          mother?
        </p>
        <p>
          This all felt too confusing for the little genius. For someone like
          her, who had been learning to discern people from a glance, felt
          conflicted with herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here, take it quick. Don't refuse; I am very lacking in talent, and
          this won't work much on me, so it's better for you to use it and grow
          stronger."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, who did not know what his expressionless sister was thinking,
          quickly stuffed the elixir into her hands; he did not want to stay in
          this place any longer lest some more nuisances popped up.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone annoying really did come this time, he did not think that
          he could restrain himself from using the special eyes like earlier,
          especially now that the guards were not there either.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 16: Tenfold benefits of body-strengthening Elixir!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 16</p>
        <p>
          He had to plan for his next steps and search for other treasures and
          opportunities for her if possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking her hand in his hand, he put the elixir carefully and quickly
          left the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia, who saw all this could not help but tremble a little after he
          left...
        </p>
        <p>
          She was shocked at herself... she actually let someone hold her hand?
        </p>
        <p>
          She, who would never let anyone be in 2 meter radius around her
          actually allowed this?
        </p>
        <p>
          No, more importantly, she realized that she was not on guard at all...
        </p>
        <p>
          She had always been trained to remain on her guard at all times, even
          against her own family, every second of the day...
        </p>
        <p>
          But now she did not even realize when he took her hand and put the
          elixir on it...
        </p>
        <p>"How can I be so careless?"</p>
        <p>
          She mumbled to herself as she stared at the elixir in her hand. She
          could still feel the warmth of his hand.
        </p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, she did not hate this...</p>
        <p>
          As she returned to her courtyard, she once again looked at the bluish
          glowing elixir and paused.
        </p>
        <p>Should she have someone verify it for poison?</p>
        <p>But when she thought of his face, she expelled the idea.</p>
        <p>
          For some reason, she did not think that he would try to poison her.
        </p>

        <p>"Have I gone crazy?"</p>
        <p>Was it due to their connection as twins that she felt this way?</p>
        <p>"What am I doing?"</p>
        <p>She touched her head, her eyes slowly widening.</p>
        <p>
          "Why am I behaving like this? It's normal that I get it tested for
          poison so just why...? Just why am I hesitant?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She clutched her short hair in frustration, she had always been
          rational and always took the best decisions in every situation yet now
          she was acting so stupidly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A moment ago, she was thinking that he was foolish and now she was
          being even stupider than him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It frustrated her, never in her life had she felt frustrated over
          something yet she was like this now.
        </p>
        <p>It was all because of him!</p>
        <p>
          'No... He surely can't poison me... He should be aware of the
          consequences of it... I am the best weapon the clan could polish, if
          something happened then he would too... he must know this, right?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia thought of many reasons that this elixir was not poisoned by
          him, connecting her assumptions.
        </p>
        <p>
          But some part of her mind knew that she was just making up things to
          satisfy herself that she did not needed to get this tested for poison.
        </p>
        <p>After minutes of self contemplation, she made up her mind.</p>
        <p>
          "If this thing really carries a poison, then so be it. I will test
          myself through this, if I am weak, I will die and if not then I will
          survive. It will be my fault that I took this so it does not matter."
        </p>
        <p>Pop!</p>
        <p>
          She opened the lid of the tube and a rich and strong aroma spread in
          her courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          'This elixir seems to have been preserved for a long time, this rich
          smell and thickness... it is definitely not the same as the ones that
          are made now.'
        </p>
        <p>
          She quickly analyzed the elixir, it was said that the more aged an
          elixir was, the more potent its effects become.
        </p>

        <p>
          And the one in her hands right now was very ancient, she could tell
          from the smell alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her amethyst eyes shone in a strange light as she looked at the elixir
          for a moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if she could see everything in the elixir at the moment. She
          was currently using the [Abyss Eyes] that she had awakened some time
          ago to see through the elixir.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I still lack proper mastery... I should have been able to tell if it
          carried poison or not just by a look... I will train harder from now
          on...'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not have expected that just a simple action of him giving
          her a potion could help her steel her resolve even further. It seemed
          to fuel her more.
        </p>
        <p>Gulp. Gulp. Gulp.</p>
        <p>
          She drank the elixir in one ago and quickly circulated the espera in
          her body to ready herself for the effect.
        </p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>__________________________</p>
        <p>[Ding! Target has consumed a rare body-strengthening elixir.]</p>
        <p>[Ding! 10x benefits obtained...]</p>
        <p>[Ding! Permanent 10x increase in Physical Strength!]</p>
        <p>
          Oliver paused, suddenly feeling a warm current flowing throughout his
          body, reaching every part of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sensed a strong surge of vitality and energy coursing through his
          veins.
        </p>
        <p>Every cell in his body felt recharged, brimming with energy.</p>
        <p>Crack!</p>
        <p>
          As he stretched, he heard the sound of his bones popping, as if they
          were adjusting to become more compact and stronger.
        </p>

        <p>
          Clasping his fists, he felt the growing strength, making him believe
          he could punch through metal.
        </p>
        <p>'Status.'</p>
        <p>
          He muttered, having tried earlier without success to see a panel.
          Nevertheless, he attempted once more, curious to see if his increased
          strength would reveal his status.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had experimented countless times before with the system, hoping for
          a full body analysis, but usually to no avail.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trying again, he wondered if there was a required trigger or if such a
          feature did not exist at all.
        </p>
        <p>Deciding to give it one final attempt...</p>
        <p>
          And he guessed correctly as a black panel suddenly opened before his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>[Name: Oliver Mystic]</p>
        <p>[Race: Human]</p>
        <p>[Strength: Level 3]</p>
        <p>[Espera: Level 1]</p>
        <p>[Charisma: Level 3]</p>
        <p>[Luck: Level 2]</p>
        <p>A general overview of his body's status appeared before him.</p>
        <p>
          Carefully observing the attributes, he had no clue what determined
          these levels.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wondered what the maximum limit for these levels could be and was
          greatly shocked by his strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after obtaining [Cosmic Void Gaze] and increasing his strength
          tenfold, he was still evaluated as only level 3?
        </p>
        <p>
          Then how strong would level 10 be if he already felt capable of
          punching through metal?
        </p>
        <p>
          'Damn, this feels both motivating and depressing at the same time.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaking his head, he only needed to wait for Nadia to quickly raise
          her strength, and he would naturally reap benefits.
        </p>
        <p>"But still... my esper talent is so pathetic."</p>
        <p>
          He couldn't help but feel speechless; it was quite shocking that
          someone born from the genes of Ophelia and the clan patriarch could be
          so weak!
        </p>
        <p>"More importantly, I need to deal with them..."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 17: Revenge</h2>
        <p>Chapter 17</p>
        <p>
          He thought to himself, already forming a revenge plan against the trio
          who had beaten him today.
        </p>
        <p>He was narrow-minded and could easily hold grudges when wronged.</p>
        <p>
          It was a mentality he had followed in his past life as well. He would
          never provoke others, but if provoked, he wouldn't hold back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was somewhat clichÃ© that first he was beaten by them and
          then he sought revenge, what else could he do? He was furious; if not
          for Nadia's healing elixir, he might have died there.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to teach them a lesson for messing with him. He was almost
          dead if not for Nadia's intervention; he couldn't let them go easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he couldn't kill them under the watchful eyes of hidden
          guards surrounding them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was outrageous that he wasn't assigned any guards, considering his
          lacking abilities, but it granted him greater freedom and privacy than
          any of his siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
          Picking up a rock nearby, he slowly clenched his fist, and the rock
          soon broke into multiple pieces under the force of his hand.
        </p>
        <p>"Amazing..."</p>
        <p>
          He marveled at his strength; it was superhuman. He was quite sure that
          no normal person could do what he had just done, not in this world or
          his previous one.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noticing the absence of the clan guardian, he wondered if the cat had
          gone to attend to some business.
        </p>

        <p>'Well... all I can do now is wait and train some more.'</p>
        <p>Just like that, a day passed.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver had mostly adjusted to the newfound strength in his body by
          now.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt like he had finally become a superhuman by the standards of
          his previous world, which made him quite excited and happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          As he meditated to train his special eyes, he suddenly heard discreet
          footsteps... He felt as if all his senses had been significantly
          enhanced.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hearing had improved by leaps and bounds; he could even hear the
          distant sounds of leaves rustling in the wind.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly sensed the approaching footsteps, folding his legs, Oliver
          observed from the paper door of his room, his eyes narrowing. Through
          the transparent wall, he could make out a distant blackish silhouette
          walking towards the courtyard gate.
        </p>
        <p>"Who could it be at this time?"</p>
        <p>
          He thought in confusion, slowly standing up and sliding open the door.
        </p>
        <p>And he quickly identified the visitor...</p>
        <p>
          It was the same second sibling who had watched him get beaten earlier!
        </p>
        <p>
          It was the same 2nd sibling who was earlier watching him get beaten...
        </p>
        <p>...and later competed with Nadia only to get embarrassed.</p>

        <p>But.. what was he doing at his place?</p>
        <p>Oliver wore his sandals and looked at his surroundings...</p>
        <p>
          His eyes, which would automatically filter out the world for him
          whenever he looked aroundâthe [Cosmic Void Gaze] was quite powerful,
          he could not see any hidden guards around as usual.
        </p>
        <p>
          His courtyard was usually not monitored by the hidden guards unless
          there was something needed from him so he did not feel surprised that
          there was an absence of hidden guards.
        </p>
        <p>"Why are you here?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver asked, his tone was a bit cold, it was clear that he was not
          welcoming of this person.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2nd elder sibling who saw that Oliver has completely healed was
          surprised a little considering the serious wounds he suffered earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          He proceeded to question first, ignoring Oliver's previous question,
          "Where is your respect? I am your older brother."
        </p>
        <p>
          His tone was arrogant and condescending as if he was looking down on
          Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver cringed at the thick-skinned and shameless sibling of his.</p>
        <p>
          "An older sibling who watched his younger brother get beaten half to
          death and enjoyed the whole show without lifting a finger, from your
          reaction, I am assuming that you don't care about what happens to me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2nd sibling was silent for a moment upon listening to his
          sarcastic remarks of anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You are right, I did not feel anything, you should know that strength
          is everything, we, the Mystic Purge clan, does not acknowledge the
          weak. If you are weak, then you are nothing."
        </p>

        <p>
          He calmly said, as if this was the most normal thing in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          "As expected from you..." Oliver did not wanted to argue with him any
          more, he directly asked,
        </p>
        <p>"What do you want from me?"</p>
        <p>
          The 2nd brother of his paused and looked at Oliver's handsome face for
          a bit, only now did he realize that his features were terrifyingly
          similar to Nadia...
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, he was too busy to look at his face and only now he realized
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at his face, the image of Nadia's face converged in his mind
          as he suddenly recalled the earlier incident where he experienced
          shame.
        </p>
        <p>
          His face turned ugly as he once again questioned in a superior tone,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why are your injuries healed? It should have taken at least a week
          for your bones and skin to even start recoveringâ"
        </p>
        <p>
          He abruptly stopped in the middle as he thought of something bizarre,
          his eyes widened at his own though as he asked in an impatient tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't tell me... did Nadia use a healing elixir on a waste like
          you... it can't be that... there's no way that girl would ever-"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at his supposed elder brother and felt amused by his
          expressions... indeed it was quite hard to accept the reality that the
          cold and ruthless Nadia had actually used an elixir on a talentless
          bastard.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this news were to spread, everyone in the clan would feel shocked,
          but more so, his mother and father would immediately isolate Nadia
          from everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia, his dangerous mother, wanted to cultivate Nadia into a
          perfect and superior existence, to her, emotions were an obstacle that
          would only get in the way of her daughter's path to greatness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was very sure that if this brat snitched on them then his
          mother would do everything to kill Nadia's emotions, and it may be as
          worse as torturing and killing him in front of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shivered a bit as he realized the seriousness, he really cannot
          allow this fake brother of his to leave easily now.
        </p>
        <p>"Well, I had a healing elixir with me that I used..."</p>
        <p>Even though he knew it was quite useless to lie in front</p>
        <p>of this guy, he still said a few words.</p>
        <p>And as he had expected, the 2nd brother flew into rage.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 18: Gaze of the Cosmic Void: Godly Fear!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 18</p>
        <p>
          And as expected, the 2nd brother was immediately furious as he said,
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you take me for a fool!? Are you saying that a pathetic waste like
          you can own an elixir? I don't think the clan would waste any
          resources on you!"
        </p>
        <p>"It is up to you whether to believe it or not."</p>
        <p>Oliver did not say any more.</p>
        <p>
          "You-! Bastard, tell me what your relationship is with Naida and why
          she stopped us last time. I expect honest answers. If you dare to play
          games, then expect to lose a limb or two."
        </p>
        <p>
          He threatened. It was quite clear that he wanted to know why Naida
          interfered last time. Even though they were twin siblings by blood, it
          did not mean anything in the clan. Only strength was the norm.
        </p>
        <p>
          If possible, he wanted to gain an advantage over Naida, and he
          believed that Oliver may know something about it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why else would she interfere? Oliver must have something important...
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you think you are capable enough to make me say it?" Oliver
          chuckled, a hint of sarcasm evident in his words.
        </p>
        <p>
          He said, "A coward older brother who ran away hiding his tail between
          his legs when faced with his talented little sister? You still have
          the guts? Hahaha."
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver naturally had no intentions of revealing anything to this
          unimportant character at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was quite true that he might as well have run away
          cowardly when facing the terrifying Naida, but he did not have to say
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it came to provoking others, he knew a lot. The characters of the
          novels were all read by him once, and he knew what triggered them the
          most as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that the children from the Mystic Purge Clan despised being
          looked down upon by someone weaker than them the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          So he did just that to provoke this 2nd brother, and the results were
          quite good as well, as he saw veins popping on his forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just because I did not face Naida, a weakling like you thinks that he
          can talk to me? It seems that I was quite lenient last time. Do you
          believe that she will come to your rescue here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2nd brother coldly sneered, "She is nicknamed 'the dark seedling';
          blood and familial bond mean nothing to her! Today, I will teach you
          what true strength means!"
        </p>
        <p>He roared and directly attacked Oliver!</p>
        <p>
          He roared as he ended the sentence and threw a punch at Oliver. The
          speed of the punch was extraordinary, and the impact it could generate
          was enough to even break a tough metal boulder.
        </p>
        <p>However, to Oliver, the punch seemed to slow down considerably.</p>
        <p>
          Not to mention the permanent boost he received in his strength last
          time that amplified his senses, but he was also the bearer of the
          upgraded version of one of the 4 mythical eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The punch was as slow as a sloth inching its way across a branch. Each
          instance felt agonizingly drawn out and easily anticipated by his
          heightened senses.
        </p>

        <p>
          His lips curled into a small smirk as he had achieved what he
          intended. He wanted this brother of his to admit that Naida was the
          cold and ruthless girl they imagined her to be.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not even want to leave a shred of doubt in their minds. By
          angering him through embarrassing provocations, he did just that.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          The fist collided, but the result was not what the 2nd brother had
          been expecting. He was initially thinking that his punch would
          directly dislocate Oliver's shoulders and might even break his arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what happened was that his punch was caught by Oliver's small
          white hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          The 2nd brother's eyes widened in disbelief as he saw what was
          happening in front of him. An impossible scene was happening at the
          moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just the last time when he saw Oliver getting brutally beaten, he
          could clearly tell that Oliver was definitely not this strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the way just light punches and kicks from his little siblings
          directly injured Oliver, it was bizarre that his punch, which was at
          least 5 times stronger than their punches, was stopped without any
          issue!
        </p>
        <p>
          He had seen Oliver's skin and bones getting bruised last time, so he
          was definitely not this robust and tough. So how did he become like
          this in just a single day!?
        </p>
        <p>The 2nd brother immediately retracted his fist...</p>
        <p>"What!?"</p>
        <p>
          At that moment, he felt as if his fist had been caught in an iron
          grip. No matter how much force he applied, he could not retract his
          fist back from Oliver's hand.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at the unshakable jade-white hand in front of him, his heart
          suddenly palpitated. A strong uneasiness was starting to spread in his
          chest as the realization dawned upon him that things were not simple
          anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dear 2nd brother..." Oliver's soft voice sounded, which drew his
          attention for a moment as he looked up at his face where their eyes
          met.
        </p>
        <p>
          What he saw in Oliver's eyes at that moment was something
          terrifying....
        </p>
        <p>It was an abyss!</p>
        <p>
          A swirling abyss of darkness and death, an endless void devoid of
          light or hope, emitting a palpable aura of dread and despair.
        </p>
        <p>
          In those eyes, he saw his deepest fears magnified a thousandfold, his
          mind consumed by an overwhelming sense of doom.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if he was staring into the abyss itself, and it was staring
          back, ready to consume him whole, opening its black cosmic maw.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was all happening because Oliver had used the 3rd ability of his
          special eyes, [Enshrouding of Death].
        </p>
        <p>"Ugk! Blegh!"</p>
        <p>
          The 2nd brother puked uncontrollably as tears flooded his eyes, but
          even then, he was unable to divert his eyes from Oliver's.
        </p>
        <p>
          He kept puking uncontrollably; he almost felt like throwing his guts
          out at the moment. His heart stirred, and he felt it was going to stop
          at any moment.
        </p>
        <p>Death had come to his door.</p>
        <p>He slowly lost all his will... he was going to die!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver stopped at that moment and used his other hand to punch the
          other party's stomach, and in the next instance, the 2nd brother
          fainted almost immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that if he did not punch him, the other party wouldn't be able
          to stop looking at his eyes, especially if the other person's mental
          resistance was not too strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          So he delivered a physical stimulus. Given his turbulent strength, he
          directly knocked out his so-called 2nd brother.
        </p>
        <p>"That should be enough."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 19: Elder's Shock!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 19</p>
        <p>"That should be enough."</p>
        <p>
          He mumbled as he lightly kicked the unconscious body of the 2nd
          brother of his.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he felt that he has successfully diverted the attention from
          Nadia but he still delivered a final blow just to seal this ordeal.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that he has fully conquered the 2nd brother's mind with fear.
          He was quite sure that in the future, this brother of his won't even
          dare to appear in front of him much less talk about him to anyone.
        </p>
        <p>The impact and fear he instilled was too strong!</p>
        <p>
          Well, Oliver would need to deliver him back to his courtyard first.
        </p>
        <p>___________________________</p>
        <p>
          After somehow finishing the delivery, he finally returned back to his
          courtyard and saw Zippy strolling near the gate as if guarding the
          entrance.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Looks like the clan guardian finished the business she left for...'
        </p>
        <p>
          He came to his room and stopped behind the door as he thought about
          the previous day's events, earlier he could clearly see the trajectory
          of the 2nd brother's punch in slow motion but when he was getting
          beaten by them, he was having trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          He realized that it must be due to the fact that the special eyes were
          too powerful for his weak body to adjust to...
        </p>

        <p>
          His nervous system has also been boosted in strength when he received
          the permanent strength boost last time.
        </p>
        <p>
          This probably allowed the special eyes to deliver the signals to his
          brain properly and also the reason he could see the fast punch in slow
          motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that even now, there was a great margin that he could work on
          and improve.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he had such strength earlier when facing the 3rd brother and
          sister, he might have been able to reduce his injuries significantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he had the excuse that his espera talent was too pathetic, he
          should have focused on training physically then.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not always wait for his target to make a breakthrough or
          achievement, he needs to train his body as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shivered as he realized that he might get left behind if he did not
          train just as much as the main characters, if that happens, his body
          might not be able to keep up with all the monstrous abilities that he
          might get in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention monstrous abilities, he would be receiving a tenfold
          version of those powers, if the vessel itself was weak then naturally
          it would break.
        </p>
        <p>He doubted that anything could save him then...</p>
        <p>
          He might even need to train harder than those main characters in the
          novels in the future if he wanted to be ready to receive great power.
        </p>
        <p>"I need to train hard..." He muttered as his eyes turned serious.</p>
        <p>Yawn...</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was also feeling a little tired after all the drama he has been
          facing since the last few days
        </p>

        <p>"Hah, I am tired!"</p>
        <p>
          He quickly went to his bed and slept for the rest of night not waking
          until afternoon next day.
        </p>
        <p>He was going to train harder to not die out of overdose of power.</p>
        <p>___________________</p>
        <p>In the 2nd brother's courtyard.</p>
        <p>
          A group of people were gathered outside his room, they all shared
          similar expressions of confusion, tension, and impatience.
        </p>
        <p>They were some of the elders of the Mystic Purge clan....</p>
        <p>
          In the clan, there were elders who favored one sibling over the others
          and provided them with preferential treatment sometimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          These elders were the caretakers of the 2nd son and daughter of the
          clan head.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving news from the guards that the 2nd young master was
          found unconscious in his room by a maid, they quickly apprehended her
          and called for an audience.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You, servant, tell us what happened to him?" questioned one of the
          elder sternly, the atmosphere was thick with bloodlust and pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The young maid trembled, her eyes wide with fear as she stammered,
          "Please, I don't know anything... I-I was simply going about my
          duties, serving tea to the young master, when I found him unconscious
          on the floor. I shook him, but he didn't respond, so I immediately
          called for the guards... Please believe me..." Her voice trailed off
          in sobs, tears streaming down her cheeks.
        </p>
        <p>The maid explained everything that she had witnessed truthfully.</p>

        <p>
          The elders also noticed this, they were experienced and skilled enough
          to tell from her body language that she was not lying and was feeling
          genuine fear from them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And their common sense also told them that all the servants and guards
          selected to work in the Mystic Purge Clan were trained rigorously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Loyalty was ingrained into their brains the moment they stepped food
          into the boundaries of the clan. It was impossible for any servant to
          even bear thoughts like this.
        </p>
        <p>So they just ignored her and discussed among themselves...</p>
        <p>
          "What happened to him suddenly? I met him just a few days ago, and he
          was looking absolutely fine!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait for some time, the medics are evaluating his condition. We will
          know shortly..."
        </p>
        <p>
          They waited for a few more minutes in silence before being called
          inside by the doctors.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He is awake but well... his condition is a bit strange. For some
          reason, he won't speak at all and would keep on shrieking from time to
          time. His mental condition looks worse, as if someone had attacked his
          brain."
        </p>
        <p>The medic gave his opinion.</p>
        <p>
          "For now, I have given him a few doses of mind-calming medicine. If
          this persists, then we will have to think of something else."
        </p>
        <p>"How can this happen so suddenly? It doesn't make sense!"</p>
        <p>An elder could not help but shout.</p>
        <p>
          "Calm down, it's highly unlikely that a high-ranking mind demon has
          infiltrated the clan... Given the barrier, it seems almost impossible.
          But then, what other reasonable explanation could there be?"
        </p>
        <p>Another elder commented as she fell into thought.</p>
        <p>"A demon!? That's absurd! Are you out of your mind!?"</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm..." The last elder, who had been quiet since the beginning and
          had a profound aura, finally spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We cannot make bold assumptions without any proof. This is a serious
          matter. A direct lineage member was attacked as such. According to the
          hidden guards, he left the courtyard ordering them to stay back and to
          not follow him, which is strange. The next thing they know is that he
          suddenly appeared back in his room in that state."
        </p>
        <p>His words made sense to everyone.</p>
        <p>
          "I further asked for a report on his previous day's actions and found
          something weird."
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 20: Who did this to you? The Elder's dilemma.</h2>
        <p>Chapter 20</p>
        <p>"What did you find peculiar, elder?"</p>
        <p>The others questioned.</p>
        <p>
          He frowned and said, "Two days ago, he was with the 3rd pair of
          siblings, and they met the 4th son on their way. They got into a
          fight, and naturally, as you all are aware, the 4th son is a waste, so
          they did him quite the number. But in the middle of the fight, young
          Miss Naida intervened..."
        </p>
        <p>"What!? Unbelievable!"</p>
        <p>"Impossible!"</p>
        <p>The other two expressed surprise.</p>
        <p>Nadia!</p>
        <p>The most likely future clan head.</p>
        <p>
          Not even the elders dared to be disrespectful to her, even though they
          were much above her in standing and power. They could, but none of
          them wanted to be on her bad side.
        </p>
        <p>She was called the dark seedling because of her deadly talent.</p>
        <p>
          Usually, every child born to the clan's direct lineage, to Mistress
          Ophelia, was highly talented.
        </p>
        <p>Butâ Oliver was an exception!</p>

        <p>
          He was born just a few weeks after Nadia and was deemed utter trash.
          He had one of the worst inherent talents, truly not worthy of their
          clan name.
        </p>
        <p>However, they suddenly felt something odd.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia, who was born just before him, was born with extreme talent, and
          he was born lacking.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if... she had sucked all of his talents and abilities while
          they were in the womb of their mother!
        </p>
        <p>
          This led everyone to make rumors that she was a dark seedling who
          stole her twin's talents, like a demoness.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, no one dared to say such a thing openly.</p>
        <p>"Why would Miss Nadia...?"</p>
        <p>One of the elders couldn't help but be curious.</p>
        <p>
          "This is something I am not sure about... apparently she ordered the
          guards to leave the scene immediately after she made him leave in a
          somewhat shameful method..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sir, are you suggesting that the second young master sought revenge
          on her later, resulting in this? Did Miss Nadia really do that...?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No way, but it does make sense. Miss Nadia is capable of such
          actions; she doesn't care about anyone."
        </p>
        <p>Another elder said in a half-complaining, half-helpless tone.</p>
        <p>
          He was really helpless. He could not say anything to Nadia after all.
          She had the direct backing of the clan head and Ophelia the great
          witch.
        </p>
        <p>
          And not to mention, she was a growing monster. Every week, she would
          progress significantly. Anyone sane won't offend her considering she
          had a great future ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Why would the second young master act so recklessly? It's hard to
          believe he didn't consider the consequences... He's impulsive, but not
          foolish."
        </p>

        <p>
          "And why was the fourth son even there in the first place? If I recall
          correctly, he's not permitted to reside in the central area. This all
          seems rather perplexing..."
        </p>
        <p>The elders bickered among themselves for some time.</p>
        <p>
          At this moment, the senior-most of them, the one with a profound aura
          from earlier, spoke, making them all silent.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It is as you all know... we cannot come to any conclusions like this.
          We have to get our answers from young master himself."
        </p>
        <p>He paused, looking at all the elders waiting for him.</p>
        <p>
          "Retrieve a healing elixir from the clan resource center. Use my name;
          I have a few elixirs left."
        </p>
        <p>
          He said calmly, shocking all the ones present. The medics had eyes
          filled with envy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Getting even a single elixir was terrifyingly hard, but the senior
          elder had a few that he could spare to use!
        </p>
        <p>This showed how influential and powerful the senior elder was.</p>
        <p>"I'll fetch it immediately!"</p>
        <p>
          The junior elder left directly. As long as they used a healing elixir,
          it was only a matter of time before they got to know everything.
        </p>
        <p>______________________</p>
        <p>
          In just about 5 minutes, the elder who had gone to fetch the elixir
          returned, he was carrying along a bottle containing a pale green
          liquid with a lot of sparkles in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just looking at it made one want to have a sip of it... after all, it
          looked delectable and smelled good.
        </p>
        <p>"Feed it to him."</p>

        <p>
          The senior elder said as he glanced at the 2nd young master who was
          tugging his hair so hard that they might just get uprooted, his eyes
          were widened and his pupils were dotted as a stream of tears kept
          going down.
        </p>
        <p>"Young master, please open your mouth..."</p>
        <p>
          The doctor quickly assisted, placing their hands on his chin, they
          gently pried open his sealed mouth while the nurses held him.
        </p>
        <p>Drip. Drip. Drip.</p>
        <p>
          Slowly the contents of the potent healing elixir were delivered in his
          mouth as everyone watched with patience as the tube carrying elixir
          slowly emptied.
        </p>
        <p>
          The doctors and other backed away after finishing the deed, allowing
          the young master to recover.
        </p>
        <p>
          They observed slowly as his eyes slowly started to relax, his
          trembling hands also calmed down as he let go of his iron grip on his
          hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          With shallow breaths, he fell back onto his bed, it was as if all
          strength had left his body.
        </p>
        <p>He could not and did not wanted to get up at all.</p>
        <p>"Young master, are you back."</p>
        <p>
          The elder asked in a calm tone as he saw their young master's body
          jolt at being suddenly called out.
        </p>
        <p>"I-I- where am I? What happened?"</p>
        <p>
          He asked unsure of what was even happening, he opened his eyes and all
          he could feel his lack of strength and mental exhaustion.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tried to remember what had happened but all he could feel was fog
          in his memories, his brain hurt a lot as he tried to recall what
          happened.
        </p>
        <p>Hiss!</p>
        <p>
          He hissed in pain as he felt a black wall blocking his access to the
          events that transpired the previous week.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time he tried to access the black wall in his memories, he would
          receive a sharp pain.
        </p>
        <p>"What happened? Why are elders gathered in my courtyard?"</p>
        <p>
          He puzzlingly questioned as he did not understand the situation but
          looking at the grave expression on their faces, he devised that
          something was wrong.
        </p>
        <p>"It seems he does not remember what has happened."</p>
