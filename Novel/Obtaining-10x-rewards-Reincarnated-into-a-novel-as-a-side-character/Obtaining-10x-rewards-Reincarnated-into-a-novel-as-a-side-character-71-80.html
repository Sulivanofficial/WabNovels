        <h2>Chapter 71 &nbsp;Bringing out the Axe!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 71</p>
        <p>Shane cautiously looked at Oliver drawing out his rapier.</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but look at his twin sister laying in his arms, her
          whole body twitching in severe pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were multiple red and blue bruises at different body parts on
          her…
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't know how many of her bones must have been broken by this
          guy.
        </p>
        <p>He was too ruthless!</p>
        <p>He took a deep breath as he realized this.</p>
        <p>
          Had he not interfered in time and stopped Oliver's last attack, it
          would have definitely crippled his sister.
        </p>
        <p>
          This guy was aiming to achieve that—he wanted to counter back by
          crippling her for life.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at Oliver and saw him looking back at him with a keen gaze,
          there was no way he was going to let them leave now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane could not help but feel a little regretful. Earlier when he had
          the ominous intuition, he should have trusted himself more and not
          engage with this guy at all.
        </p>
        <p>He knew at a glance now that he was an anomaly!</p>

        <p>How could he get so strong in just a span of a few months?</p>
        <p>
          There was something abnormal going behind the scenes that they were
          not aware of…
        </p>
        <p>It seemed that they had messed with wrong person.</p>
        <p>
          Sure enough, the blood of Mystic Purge Clan could never produce trash.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a fool to believe that there was a trash among their siblings.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that too, the twin sibling of Nadia, the monster among monsters!
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed as he gently laid her sister's groaning body by a tree
          nearby.
        </p>
        <p>He got up and faced Oliver, his eyes turning serious as well.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw Shane making a wave using hands as a long blade suddenly
          appeared in his hands.
        </p>
        <p>'A space-attributed artifact…'</p>
        <p>
          He recognized the trick at a glance. These artifacts were quite
          expensive and an average exorcist had to save up to even dream of
          buying one.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze was drawn back to Shane's stance as he readied himself too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today was the day he would let them experience the feeling of being on
          the verge of death!
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane was unlike his sister who was impulsive and jumped straight at
          Oliver, he was more calm and rational.
        </p>

        <p>
          But the sadism was something common among all the people of the Mystic
          Purge Clan, it was something that ran in their very blood apparently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane smirked, "You have really shown me a surprising sight today, I
          don't think I will ever be forgetting this scene."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not reply, he knew there was no use in trying to provoke
          this guy, he was not a guy to be provoked by words easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moonlight filtered through the canopy, casting a ghostly glow upon
          their fierce battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver gripped the rapier tight, positioning it gracefully in front of
          him, while Shane brandished his own blade with a confident flourish as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>They moved suddenly in the dark!</p>
        <p>
          Shane's blade sliced through the air with lethal precision. Oliver
          instincts kicked in, and he sidestepped the attack with a deft motion,
          easily avoiding the razor-sharp edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could tell that Shane had been trained by a professional master of
          blade. But multiplied experience from Nadia who was trained by the
          best of best easily let Oliver dodge the attack.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver thrust his rapier forward, his aim was Shane's chest.</p>
        <p>
          But Shane saw this and quickly reacted, parrying the strike with a
          practiced ease.
        </p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          The clash of metal echoed in the silent forest as their blades met,
          each one of them testing the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane was not an easy guy, he did a swift counter and slashed at
          Oliver's exposed flank, drawing blood with a deep gush across his
          side. n/o/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver winced in pain but did not back down, using his superior
          strength instead, he pushed forward and launched multiple strikes and
          feints.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane saw this and tried dodging but his speed was not fast enough as
          his body suffered multiple small cuts simultaneously,
        </p>
        <p>
          'You little-!' He could not help but grit his teeth as he sent a wave
          of espera towards Oliver pushing him backwards forcefully.
        </p>
        <p>
          He panted slightly as he looked at the similarly panting Oliver in the
          distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but let out a laugh as he wiped sweat off his
          forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I never expected to be pushed back like this today… say, how about
          forgetting this ever happened? I am willing to let this matter rest, I
          will also let my sister not interfere with you in the future?"
        </p>
        <p>He offered in a raised voice.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmph. If you will let me puncture your limbs with my rapier right now
          and apologize while kowtowing then I might consider letting you two
          leave."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sneered and replied, as he clutched the rapier in one hand
          while his other hand slowly reached his backpack as he drew out the
          axe he had brought along with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane frowned when he heard this, naturally he was not willing to
          allow someone to puncture him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze turned weird when he saw Oliver drawing out an axe in the
          middle of their fight. He was a bit confused at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>'An Axe?'</p>
        <p>
          He could not comprehend why Oliver, a person who has been using
          rapier, a light weapon would suddenly use an axe, a heavy and
          cumbersome weapon.
        </p>
        <p>Wasn't this equivalent to putting oneself at disadvantage…?</p>
        <p>He felt that Oliver was not simple and had a plan in his mind.</p>
        <p>
          He was not going give Oliver any time to adjust as he suddenly jumped
          forward, his blade aiming for Oliver's arm holding the axe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver narrowed his eyes as he as could not help but feel that Shane
          was indeed quick-witted and smart, he saw an unknown variable and
          immediately acted to remove the variable as fast as he could.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, he had brought out an axe, a weapon that was the complete
          opposite of a rapier in all aspects.
        </p>
        <p>A rapier had a long range while the axe had a short reach</p>

        <h2>Chapter 72 &nbsp;Using Axe in a battle?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 72</p>
        <p>A rapier had a long range while the axe had a short reach…</p>
        <p>A rapier was light while an axe was heavy…</p>
        <p>
          It was in complete contrast, his choice of weapons was very weird but
          at the same time, his style of handling and the way he was holding the
          two weapons made a beautiful scene at the moment for any onlooker
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The combination of grace and barbarism—each complimenting the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neither side trying to diminish the other's presence but instead
          glorifying their user.
        </p>
        <p>But why would he chose an axe right now…?</p>
        <p>It was simple.</p>
        <p>
          An axe while it typically had shorter reach as compared to a sword or
          rapier, he could use this to his advantage whenever his rapier clashed
          with Shane's blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          While an axe was heavy and cumbersome, it serves as a great defense,
          if he used it properly, he could use the broad head of the axe to
          deflect or block Shane's strikes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unlike a sword or rapier which typically had a single edge for cutting
          or thrusting, an axe has both a cutting edge and a blunt side. He
          could alternate between slashing and bludgeoning alternatively.
        </p>
        <p>
          A good means to catch Shane off-balance and unable to predict his next
          move.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite an axe's size, it could surprisingly work quickly in the hands
          of someone skilled.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver realized this while training with it.</p>
        <p>Click! n/o/vel/b//in dot c//om</p>
        <p>
          Shane had made the first move, his blade came cutting through the air
          with a silken sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was not easy as he immediately protected his side with a parry
          from his rapier.
        </p>
        <p>Clang! Clang!</p>
        <p>
          The clash of metal reverberated through the silent darkness of the
          night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane became a bit restless when his strike was blocked by Oliver, he
          had expected Oliver's speed to be slowed down due to the heavy axe but
          astonishingly he was still able to block his strike with the same ease
          as before.
        </p>
        <p>He could not spot a difference at all from before!</p>
        <p>'Fuck! How much strength does this guy have!?"</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but curse internally, this was the first time that
          someone had managed to give him this much trouble, it was even more
          humiliating that this someone was younger than him as well!
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          Shane released a flurry of blurring moves using another blade style he
          had learned hoping to gain an advantage.
        </p>
        <p>This did seem to work a little as it forced Oliver to retreat.</p>

        <p>
          With each clash, small sparks flew as their weapons met, the sound of
          metal on metal filled the air with a symphony of combat making anyone
          hold their breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was bleeding from multiple wounds, Shane was definitely no
          joke, managing to wound him so much in such a short interval just
          proved his skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane was also the same, carrying an equal amount of wounds all over
          his body, but upon closer look, his wound were slightly deeper and
          forced. His face was now filled with multiple scratches from Oliver's
          sharp rapier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver jumped at Shane making the latter alert as he thrust his rapier
          forward towards Shane's head.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane bent back and quickly moved his blade blocking the tip of his
          rapier. But Oliver was one step ahead as he swung his axe with force
          of a lumberjack's blow.
        </p>
        <p>Clang! Bang! Swish!</p>
        <p>"Gasp…!"</p>
        <p>
          Shane released a series of continuous gasps and grunts as his body
          exerted more and more espera in the heat of battle.
        </p>
        <p>
          His left shoulder was brutalized by Oliver's axe, it was wounded badly
          and was now leaking blood like a fountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was in so much pain as the axe's sharp edge tore apart his flesh
          with every swing, his blade was already busy dealing with the deadly
          rapier.
        </p>
        <p>
          On top of it all, Oliver seemed to have infinite physical stamina and
          strength, despite fighting his sister and now him, he was not getting
          exhausted at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver on the other hand was also shocked by how resilient Shane was,
          he was proving tougher and tougher with every moment passing by…
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite his best efforts, Shane's blade was like dance of sharpness,
          its movements were fluid and quick!
        </p>
        <p>
          He was struggling to keep up as he strained his muscles with the
          effort of parrying blow after blow.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shane took a deep breath as he steadied himself, a large ball of brown
          colored espera gathered in front of him as he launched it repeatedly
          towards Oliver,
        </p>
        <p>
          This move consumed a lot of espera and he was still in the process of
          perfecting it but he knew that if he did not use it then he might get
          completely cornered by Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          And in the next moment, he saw the results of this attack as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver dodged one, two but the continuous barrage got to him as he was
          directly thrown back crashing to a tree.
        </p>
        <p>"Cough… cough…"</p>
        <p>
          He coughed up blood as he quickly placed a hand on his chest to steady
          himself, adjusting his breathing to minimize the pain from the impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shane let out a cruel smirk as he did not dare to give Oliver even a
          moment's worth of rest and directly slashed at him with his blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver slid through the patch of grass nearby, dodging Shane's slash
          in a narrow way.
        </p>
        <p>"Fucking bastard, why do you keep dodging. Just DIE!!"</p>
        <p>
          Shane's rational face crumbled as it was replaced by a livid
          expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not tolerate it anymore, he was not able to land a proper
          slash at Oliver!
        </p>
        <p>His usual calm look could not keep up any longer!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver maintained a calm expression and a calm mind, he felt good to
          see such an expression on his enemy's face.
        </p>
        <p>It made him satisfied.</p>
        <p>Shane just looked like an ugly moment right now.</p>
        <p>If he was given a mirror, he might even faint looking at himself.</p>
        <p>However, he did not delay and got into stance once again.</p>
        <p>
          He was not going to give Shane any more opportunities to use espera
          like before.
        </p>
        <p>He attacked once again.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 73 &nbsp;No way...!?</h2>
        <p>&nbsp;Chapter 73</p>
        <p>Shane moved his blade from one angle to another.</p>
        <p>
          Just when it seemed like Shane had the upper hand, Oliver finally saw
          his opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>Crunch!</p>
        <p>
          With a swift feint, he drew Shane's attention away from his axe,
          tossing it into the air before catching it mid-air by the handle and
          then brought it down with all his might, the blade bit into Shane's
          shoulder with a sickening thud.
        </p>
        <p>"AGHH-!!"</p>
        <p>
          Shane cried out in pain, staggering back as blood welled in massive
          amounts from the wound. He could even see something white beneath it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was that his tissues or bones? He did not know but it pained very bad.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver maintained a neutral look as the moonlight reflected back from
          his rapier. Pressing to his advantage, his rapier darted forward with
          insane speed. With a final thrust, he pierced through Shane's abdomen,
          the tip of his rapier finding its mark with lethal accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>"Kuh-!"</p>
        <p>
          Shane directly spat blood onto the ground as his eyes felt the world
          tremble.
        </p>
        <p>
          He bit his lips to prevent losing consciousness as he backed down.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You forced me to use this." Shane spoke in a hoarse voice as blood
          kept spilling from his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes were filled with killing intent when he looked at Oliver's
          expressionless face.
        </p>
        <p>
          It reminded him of Nadia's face… they resembled each other too much
          for his discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver became alert when he saw him doing some strange movements, he
          activated [Cosmic Void Gaze] and saw espera rapidly gathering around
          Shane rapidly and quickly realized that he was about to perform a
          secret art.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just die, you bastard!" Shane mumbled as his eyes turned ignited into
          craziness and madness. He no longer cared about the rules, he just
          wanted to kill Oliver now.
        </p>
        <p>
          'So be it.' Oliver also realized that he was not in a state to simply
          dodge or counter without revealing any of his cards.
        </p>

        <p>
          Shane placed the blade straight in front of his chest as he closed his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"[Trip of the Seven Serpents]"</p>
        <p>He spoke aloud, his voice echoing in the forest.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not delay and got into a stance of his own in front of
          Shane's eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          He threw the axe to the side as he stretched the hand holding the
          rapier forward in a straight line pointing towards Shane.
        </p>
        <p>"[Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom]"</p>
        <p>
          It all happened in a split second, as both parties launched their own
          secret attacks.
        </p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          A series of terrifyingly loud booming sounds were produced in the
          silent forest sending an uproar among the nearby demons or humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          The explosion was deafening, shattering the serene silence of the
          forest and reverberating through the trees with a force that seemed to
          shake the very earth beneath their feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shockwave of the impact rippled through the air like a
          thunderclap, echoing off the distant mountains and sending birds
          fleeing from their perches in a panicked frenzy…
        </p>
        <p>_________________</p>
        <p>
          The result of the aftermath soon turned clear as all the dust slowly
          cleared with the strong winds.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was leaning against a tree—using it as a medium to support his
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          In front of him was Shane, lying in a pool of blood as he barely let
          out a few breaths, struggling to even open his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          No part of his body was unharmed, the [Sovereign Strike of Infinite
          Freedom] not only consumed Shane's secret art but also annihilated the
          trees behind with the force it generated.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground beneath their feet was gouged and cratered, as if the very
          earth had been torn apart by some unseen force.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air was still thick with swirling dust and debris, obscuring
          vision and choking lungs with its gritty hold.
        </p>

        <p>
          Trees were laying splintered around and the once green canopy was now
          nothing more than a chaotic tangle of branches
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver just laughed as he looked at the broken rapier in his hand
          which could not handle the power of the technique full.
        </p>
        <p>
          A wave of satisfaction washed over him as he saw Shane in a state
          worse than he was in when they had beaten him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He supported himself back and got on his on two feet with some
          difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>He was currently panting hard from exhaustion and pain.</p>
        <p>"I should have purchased a healing potion…"</p>
        <p>"You should have."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver froze in his tracks as he heard a voice behind him, he knew the
          owner of the voice in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>It was the 3rd sister.</p>
        <p>
          Before he could even turn around, a sharp pain assaulted his chest.
        </p>
        <p>Splash!</p>
        <p>"Agh-!"</p>
        <p>
          A stream of blood oozed out from his front as he coughed violently.
        </p>
        <p>He could see a black sharp weapon extending behind him slightly.</p>
        <p>She had used a sword to pierce him in the center of his chest.</p>
        <p>'H-How…?'</p>
        <p>
          He looked in disbelief as he turned around with great difficulty, he
          saw her looking at him with a cold and murderous expression.
        </p>
        <p>An expression of extreme hatred was etched on her face.</p>
        <p>
          But more importantly, the thing he noticed was that her injuries,
          although still there, seemed to be duller than before.
        </p>
        <p>He saw as she curled her fingers and punched at his face.</p>

        <p>
          She spat, "I don't like the look in your eyes, this defiant look… how
          vexing."
        </p>
        <p>One punch after another as she vented out her anger.</p>
        <p>"How did you change so much!?"</p>
        <p>"How did you gain such strength!?"</p>
        <p>"TELL ME!!"</p>
        <p>She used an espera-infused punch and sent him flying forward.</p>
        <p>"Ugh-!"</p>
        <p>Oliver groaned in pain, his mind and vision were getting dizzy.</p>
        <p>
          He had already realized that this girl had brought a healing potion
          along with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was no surprise, she was one of the main heirs of the clan, she was
          showered with resources and should have a few potions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly started to concentrate and calm himself, the pain was
          searing but fortunately, his vitals were safe for now.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not look at Oliver right away and instead went up to her
          brother first. n/o/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>"Shane…"</p>
        <p>
          She whispered as she saw his bad state, a frown slowly made its way on
          her forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was the one who knew him the most, she knew that Shane was very
          strong, stronger than the 2nd brother and this was the reason why she
          often listened to him.
        </p>
        <p>Seeing him in such a critical state made her feel mad.</p>
        <p>
          "I never expected that you would be beaten to such an extent by him…
          you disappoint me."
        </p>
        <p>
          She scowled in a colder tone as her eyes had a look of disappointment
          in them.
        </p>
        <p>She did not like how he was also defeated by Oliver.</p>
        <p>
          That's right, she was not mad because Oliver had beaten her brother to
          such a state but because Shane was defeated so badly by him.
        </p>
        <p>It made her lose her respect for him.</p>
        <p>
          She knew that even she was defeated by that Oliver but it was not this
          bad… he was almost on death bed at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>"Tch."</p>
        <p>
          She clicked her tongue in annoyance and took out another healing
          potion from her pocket. It was a tube of liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cupping his mouth in her hands, slowly pouring its contents into his
          panting mouth.
        </p>

        <p>Chapter 74</p>
        <p>
          Shane almost got choked by the sudden influx of warm liquid and tried
          to move away his head but was unable to.
        </p>
        <p>
          She saw this and did not care at all. It was his fault for being in
          this state.
        </p>
        <p>Should have been stronger…</p>
        <p>
          Yes, this was how the true mindset of Mystic Purge Clan's little
          siblings worked, they did not harbor emotional attachment to one
          another but a sense of respect for the other's strength, the benefits
          they could give them and their use.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was just that since they were always born in pairs of twins that
          they stuck together with their twin more but it was not a necessity.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Although I doubt that it will have much effect on you given your
          current state, but at least, it will save you from dying quickly."
        </p>
        <p>
          She said in a flat tone as she slowly put his head down on the ground,
          allowing him to rest slowly as his breathing slowly started to
          stabilize.
        </p>
        <p>Her gaze turned towards Oliver who had now also stood back up.</p>
        <p>His chest was hurting a lot but he was still somehow managing…</p>
        <p>"Heh."</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but let out a short laugh even in this situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not know if he had a screw loose or not, but in tense
          situations or scary situations, he would subconsciously smile or
          laugh.
        </p>

        <p>
          Just like how his mind cracked up when he suddenly bid in the auction
          that time for absolutely no reason.
        </p>
        <p>And now…</p>
        <p>
          Looking at him smirking and laughing as if making fun of her, she
          could not help but feel speechless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was this guy really sane? He knew his wounds and his disadvantage
          against her but was still provoking her…? n/o/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>She even felt tired for getting angry anymore.</p>
        <p>
          She just wanted revenge now, for him daring to try and cripple her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would make sure that he would not be able to move a finger for the
          rest of his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her black colored sword was particularly ominous and Oliver suspected
          it had a special property associated with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, he did not retreat, there was no way he was going to let this
          girl off after what she did just now.
        </p>
        <p>"Come at me."</p>
        <p>
          He called out to her and she responded by rushing towards him with a
          cold face.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time she was going to finish him off for good, she had the
          advantage this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver used his axe and squatted down, avoiding her slash while he
          slashed forward with the axe aiming to hurt her legs this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he was slower this time due to multiple injuries which she used to
          her advantage as she quickly used his head for her own support and
          jumped over him avoiding the axe by a narrow degree.
        </p>

        <p>Hiss!</p>
        <p>This guy was going to remove her legs with his axe!</p>
        <p>
          She angrily moved her sword backward aiming at Oliver's back but
          Oliver was quick to dodge and barely managed to slide to his left.
        </p>
        <p>
          His chest was hurting bad due to the earlier attack, he did not
          believe that he could allow this to go on for more.
        </p>
        <p>He might get really crippled this time.</p>
        <p>
          She was using espera to not only enhance her speed of her movements
          but also the force behind her attacks.
        </p>
        <p>She was too vicious!</p>
        <p>
          He was not amused internally although he still had a small smirk
          etched on his lips.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was this the adrenaline rush from dangerous and life-threatening
          battles that was making him excited this much?
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not sure and neither did he have the time to contemplate about
          it at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>'It seems that I have to use that now'</p>
        <p>
          He frowned internally when he thought about how a group of elders
          might be watching their fight with keen interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's right, he knew that the clan would never let a promising
          candidate die in this demon hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          A group of elders and elites were definitely watching each
          participant, monitoring everything.
        </p>

        <p>
          They would make sure to interfere if the life of a participant was
          threatened.
        </p>
        <p>
          One might wonder what the reason was that they had not interfered in
          Shane's and Oliver's previous fight so far?
        </p>
        <p>
          It was simple because Oliver had not intended to kill Shane in the
          first place and the wounds that he gave to him were although serious
          but almost all of them were intended to cripple him rather than to
          kill him.
        </p>
        <p>Unlike Shane, Oliver took the big picture in his mind.</p>
        <p>
          He was obviously going to be severely punished by the clan if he dared
          to kill someone. Not to mention he had no backing in the clan so he
          would be at more disadvantage compared to the 3rd pair of siblings
          with their own factions behind them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, the elders of the clan were extremely powerful, they
          could tell if Shane's life was in danger or not. If they had not
          interfered then that meant he was not going to die anytime soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          As for getting crippled, while it was frowned upon, it was not against
          the rules of the hunt.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Shane did get crippled by Oliver then he could only blame himself
          for being a weakling.
        </p>
        <p>They were not going to spoon-feed him here.</p>
        <p>
          The clan had strict rules that even they were not allowed to bypass.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were very indifferent to such things, only strength and potential
          mattered in their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, wouldn't Shane's future and potential be ruined if he got
          crippled?
        </p>
        <p>As for that, the elders shared a similar thought…</p>
        <p>
          They would just feed him an elixir to help him recover back later.
        </p>
        <p>
          While indeed an elixir was an epic-rank item that was hard to come by,
          given the clan's rich history of centuries and the excellent
          alchemists working endlessly, they often produced a batch of elixirs
          every few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          And using one on a main heir was not a waste of resources, not only
          would he experience the feeling of fighting a near-death battle
          without actually dying but also realize not to be too arrogant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt uncomfortable showing his cards like this but since the
          situation demanded so, he cannot back down.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not use the [Cosmic Void Gaze] in case the elders behind the
          2nd brother would quickly find the similarities and suspect him.
        </p>
        <p>
          At that time, he would definitely be asked about his sources of power
          and all sorts of questions which he would rather not answer at all.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 75</h2>
        <p>
          Not only that, but he also felt that using [Cosmic Void Gaze] would be
          too easy for them. It would be less painful for them if he directly
          attacked their minds and was done with it. He did not want to give
          them the same treatment he had given the 2nd brother.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were the ones who had actually beaten him, not the 2nd brother,
          and thus they deserved an equal amount of punishment from his hands,
          which had been itching for a while. Using [Cosmic Void Gaze] would be
          less painful for them; beating them with his own hands was far more
          satisfying given the treatment they had given him the last time.
        </p>
        <p>"Haha…"</p>
        <p>Clang!</p>
        <p>
          Another clash of her sword against his axe. She could not help but
          grit her teeth when she saw how tenacious he was, even after being
          pierced by her sword. It was as if he was a wall she could not breach
          no matter what she did. He was strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes widened with each failed attempt, a new sense of uneasiness
          gripping her heart with every move he deflected or dodged. He was too
          crazy! Even with such serious injuries, he was able to fight her. How
          much stamina and strength did he have!?
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver realized that Level 4 Strength was no joke. Not only did he
          have excellent stamina and vitality, but also immense physical power
          even in this wounded state.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fucking…" he grunted as she slashed at his waist, making him retreat.
          Just as she rushed at him with a crazed look in her eyes, he clutched
          the handle of the axe and threw it straight at her face. She gasped at
          the sight of the flying axe, immediately rolling to the side to avoid
          the dangerous object.
        </p>

        <p>Did this guy want to kill her!?</p>
        <p>
          'He lost his only weapon now… fool,' she thought, believing he did
          this to stop her advances and get a moment of respite. How could she
          know that Oliver had something else on his mind?
        </p>
        <p>
          Stretching back his hand, he exhaled and inhaled slowly, relaxing his
          body as he got into a stance. With one leg back, his right hand
          stretched behind him while the left hand curled horizontally against
          his chest, he looked at her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't care about his weird stance at all and rushed at him with
          maddening speed, wanting to finally finish him off. However, it was at
          that moment she heard him say something.
        </p>
        <p>"[Eternal Twelve Lies Palm]."</p>
        <p>
          She didn't understand what he said, but it was too late to back out
          now. Time seemed to slow down for both of them as they locked eyes.
          Oliver extended his palm towards her, meeting the tip of her sword.
          Everything seemed to slow down at that moment before their eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          She kept looking at Oliver's emotionless face while Oliver stared into
          her maniacal eyes. His palm and her sword connected. As her sword tip
          touched his palm, a shockwave of raw power exploded from the point of
          contact, rippling through the air and shaking the ground beneath them.
          It was as if the very sky was falling apart.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that instant, she felt a terrifying force erupt before her. Twelve
          beings appeared, each mimicking a different stance. All were as tall
          as mountains and as intimidating as the most terrifying demons. At
          that moment, all of them looked down at her with murderous intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The twelve towering beings moved with synchronized grace, their eyes
          blazing with an otherworldly fire that seemed to pierce through her
          soul. She felt as if she was being stared down by twelve godly beings.
          Her mind couldn't comprehend what was happening. One moment she was
          staring into Oliver's eyes, and the next she was being looked down
          upon by twelve godly warriors.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her body froze, unable to move an inch as overwhelming fear engulfed
          her mind. She trembled uncontrollably, helplessly watching them move
          their hands in unison, delivering a tremendous blow. The air crackled
          with energy, the ground splintered, and a deafening roar filled her
          ears, drowning out her scream. Each of the twelve warriors struck with
          the power of a falling star, their blows converging into a single,
          devastating impact that shattered her defenses and hurled her
          backward, her body crumpling like a rag doll.
        </p>
        <p>
          The impact was like a thousand storms converging at once, shattering
          everything in its path.
        </p>
        <p>BOOM!</p>
        <p>
          Everything went white for her in the next instant. The sheer power of
          the [Eternal Twelve Lies Palm] obliterated her, leaving nothing but
          deafening silence in its wake.
        </p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>
          "Huff… Huff…" Oliver lay on the forest floor, his situation critical.
          His right hand was twisted backwards, his chest leaking blood, his
          abdomen and legs covered in sword slashes. His forehead was smeared
          with blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cough…" He coughed out more blood, weakly trying to look around but
          unable to. He was completely exhausted, without even an ounce of
          stamina or power to move. He looked at the blood staining both his
          body and clothes. He did not know if this blood belonged to him or was
          from the siblings.
        </p>
        <p>Siblings? What happened to them?</p>
        <p>
          He painfully craned his neck and spotted the 3rd sister lying some
          distance away. Her eyes were open wide, completely whitened, foam
          filling her mouth. Her body twitched from time to time as if deeply
          traumatized by something. He did not know what illusion she saw when
          he attacked her, but he knew it was terrifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not make out the details while lying down. He rested on that
          spot for the next 20 minutes, unable to move an inch. He felt the cool
          breeze rustling the leaves, refreshing him for some reason. The thick
          bloody scent in the air made him anxious; it wouldn't be long before
          demons were attracted to their location.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had yet to capture a demon; it would be a great loss if he couldn't
          hunt even a single demon and bring it back. He wanted the rewards.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ugh-!" He groaned in pain as he slowly but steadily crawled to the
          3rd sister's body. He had seen her bring out healing potions before
          and felt there might be more in her pocket. Somehow he managed to
          reach her, shuffling through her pocket until his hand felt something
          hard inside.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 76</h2>
        <p>
          Somehow, he managed to reach close to her and shuffled through her
          pocket before his hand felt something hard inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a glass vial, a tube. He exerted some force and drew it out.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was indeed a healing potion. While not as miraculous as an elixir,
          it was quite effective for recovery and healing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt it was a necessary item for him. If he let the blood leak any
          longer, he might just die from blood loss.
        </p>
        <p>At least, his life would not be in any immediate danger.</p>
        <p>
          He quickly opened the cap and drank the potion, gulping it down
          quickly.
        </p>
        <p>The effect was instant as he felt his strength returning slowly.</p>
        <p>
          A warm feeling spread over the wounds on his body, and a comforting
          sensation washed over him.
        </p>
        <p>"Haah…"</p>
        <p>
          He exhaled in relief and lay down for another five minutes before
          slowly standing up.
        </p>
        <p>The scene before him was truly destructive.</p>
        <p>
          The trees were broken, branches and blood were scattered all around,
          and the moonlight reflected off the red blood, giving the scene a
          reddish shine.
        </p>

        <p>
          He looked around and saw his axe was nowhere to be seen in the dark.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the sword in the third sister's hand was damaged by the previous
          impact.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced towards Shane, and his blade was in the same condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and reached for his bag, intending to loot them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shuffling through the third sister's pocket, he retrieved her talisman
          and saw that one mark was missing from the inscribed runes on it when
          they received it.
        </p>
        <p>This meant that a demon was currently sealed inside the talisman.</p>
        <p>
          'So she had already gotten a demon. Too bad, you're not getting it
          back.'
        </p>
        <p>
          After making sure he had properly inspected her, he went towards Shane
          and did the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, he managed to find another healing potion and an unused
          talisman.
        </p>
        <p>'Good!'</p>
        <p>He nodded to himself as he slowly started to leave. As for them?</p>
        <p>
          He was leaving them there. It was not his problem how they dealt with
          demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be better if they got eaten by the demons, but he knew that
          was impossible.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sooner or later, an elder would definitely come to their rescue. The
          Mystic Purge Clan was known for its strict vigilance over its members.
          He had to act fast before they arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickened his pace, the night air growing colder with each step.
          His instincts screamed at him to move faster.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, a strong wind assaulted his back as he looked behind. He
          spun around, his eyes focusing sharply.
        </p>
        <p>He saw a glowing figure floating in the sky.</p>
        <p>His eyes slightly narrowed. Sure enough, an elder had come.</p>
        <p>
          It was almost instant, as if they had been watching them for a long
          time and waited for him to be done before appearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder's sudden appearance sent a chill down his spine. It felt as
          if the elder had been observing, waiting for the precise moment to
          intervene. There was no doubt now—his every action had been monitored.
        </p>
        <p>He observed the elder's features.</p>
        <p>
          The elder was an old man with a short white goatee and short silver
          hair. Not inherited but aged, lacking in luster.
        </p>
        <p>
          A strange energy field surrounded the elder as he floated in the sky.
          His eyes were indifferent and cold as he looked down.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if a celestial was looking down on mortals.</p>
        <p>
          Despite the inhumane and bloody scene beneath, his gaze did not falter
          as he directly stared into Oliver's eyes from above.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver suddenly felt a weird sensation in his body upon being probed
          by the elder. However, he did not resist. He knew the elder was
          curious about his secrets and the strength he displayed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder probably wanted to find out if they had missed something
          during his birth or if he was being controlled by a demonic being.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, since that was not the case and it was just his natural
          physical powers, the elder was unable to find anything out of the
          ordinary no matter how much he probed again and again.
        </p>
        <p>
          A look passed through the elder's serene and aged eyes, carrying the
          wisdom of the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          He slowly descended from the sky and, instead of landing near the
          siblings, he landed in front of Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver couldn't help but feel that the elder was quite graceful and
          elegant. Was it due to his age that his posture and moves felt
          refined, or was it just his lack of taste and power?
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, Oliver was not wrong. The elder before him had persisted in
          the Mystic Purge Clan for centuries and could be counted among the
          strongest beings in the entire world.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a sage that many exorcists aspired to even get a glance of, to
          receive words of guidance from—an experienced teacher and a veteran
          exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder had countless achievements associated with his name like the
          other elders. This was the case for all of the top five clans and
          their elites.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver felt an invisible pressure on his shoulders…</p>
        <p>
          No, it was not due to the elder releasing his power onto him, but just
          a natural pressure from such a being who had fought and slaughtered
          countless demons over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder did not say anything for a moment and just stared at the
          youth in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver… the isolated child, the child born without any talent, the
          child who was denied the clan's name publicly, the only main heir
          mocked openly by the crowd, the child with all sorts of rumors
          associated with his lack of talent.
        </p>
        <p>
          The child who was said to have had his talent devoured by his twin
          during birth.
        </p>
        <p>The child of misfortune and shame.</p>
        <p>
          But what they all witnessed just now was definitely not something a
          child without any talent could achieve.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only did he defeat one but two of the most talented kids from the
          main family lineage, but he also managed to crush them one-sidedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was he supposed to believe that he was still an untalented bastard?
        </p>
        <p>How could he, after what he just saw?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 77</h2>
        <p>The elder finally spoke in a serene tone.</p>
        <p>"You are really ruthless, even to your own blood."</p>
        <p>It was not an insult, nor was it a compliment.</p>
        <p>
          It was just a statement to Oliver's ears. He was unable to discern the
          elder's intentions from his tone or words.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So what?" Oliver muttered. His tone was neither rude nor provocative;
          he directly asked the elder what he wanted to say.
        </p>
        <p>
          For a moment, the forest was silent, the only sound was the faint
          rustling of leaves. Oliver felt the weight of the elder's gaze, as if
          he was being seen for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>The elder looked at the young face and those eyes…</p>
        <p>
          Those eyes… He felt something mysterious and deep within them but
          could not exactly tell what. This surprised him. It was the first time
          he couldn't comprehend something.
        </p>
        <p>He said, "Nothing. How do you feel?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver frowned, feeling that the elder was being weird. If he wanted
          to say something, he should just spit it out. What was the point of
          moving around in circles?
        </p>

        <p>
          "What? Are you here to avenge them?" Oliver asked, his tone growing
          colder. If that was the case, it would be very hard to leave unscathed
          from here.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind raced through possible escape routes, but he knew none would
          be fast enough if the elder decided to act.
        </p>
        <p>"No, not at all. I am not here to interfere."</p>
        <p>
          Contrary to his expectations, the elder simply shook his head and
          denied the notion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw him glancing at the healing vial and the talisman he had
          looted earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Want them back?" he smirked and asked playfully. He knew the elder
          was not allowed to interfere in the hunt and obstruct other
          participants. He was just testing the elder's limits now.
        </p>
        <p>
          A mischievous glint appeared in Oliver's eyes. He decided to test the
          boundaries of the elder's patience.
        </p>
        <p>
          The inner devil in him wanted to abuse this situation for his benefit.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thrill of pushing limits, of dancing on the edge of danger, was
          intoxicating.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to try provoking the elder. He had read in novels that
          protagonists would usually provoke and scam such elders with their
          arrogant words, and the elders, who had pride as high as mountains,
          would get furious and let the protagonist scam them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, real life was much different from his willful imagination.
          The elder again shook his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can keep them. It is their fault for not being strong enough to
          defend their possessions. I can see that you wish to provoke me like
          you did with the two siblings. I would advise you to not do such
          things in the future. As an elder, you will only make more enemies
          instead of allies if you act like this. Feel free to ignore my words.
          Good luck on your hunt."
        </p>

        <p>
          The elder's calm demeanor was unshakeable, a testament to his
          centuries of experience. It was clear Oliver's provocations were
          falling flat.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder spoke in a calm voice, not offended at all. He turned around
          and moved his fingers in the air as the two siblings disappeared from
          their positions.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was curious about the two powerful unknown techniques that the boy
          had utilized in the fight but did not ask. He knew those techniques
          were not used to their full potential but were already so destructive.
          He could imagine what the output would be if someone like him or above
          him used that technique.
        </p>
        <p>A great weapon against demons…</p>
        <p>
          Oliver couldn't help but touch his neck awkwardly. The elder was
          correct; he was being immature. While some people get offended easily,
          this elder from the clan seemed quite wise and calm. Oliver couldn't
          help but respect him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had expected a scenario like those in cliché novels where he
          offends a powerhouse and is then hunted down by the clan and their
          forces. He felt relieved that it did not develop into that. He was not
          sure if he could live his life in hiding forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, he left the scene, heading back to his hidden den near the
          water stream. He was thirsty and hungry.
        </p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>"Gulp… Gulp… Haah~"</p>
        <p>
          He quenched his thirst by drinking mouthfuls of fresh, cold water. In
          the middle of the night, drinking chilled water was the best.
        </p>
        <p>Rumble…</p>

        <p>
          "Ugh, I am hungry…" His stomach rumbled. The previous fight had
          drained him too much. He needed to eat something urgently, or it would
          be difficult to fight and concentrate.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not find anything to eat in their belongings, so he was in a
          bind.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could try to eat a demon, but there was a chance he would get
          poisoned since their flesh and blood were toxic to humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed. There was not much choice. He could only try to find some
          fruits in the forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, he mustered up his last bit of power and used [Cosmic Void
          Gaze] to find some fruits that he ate quickly.
        </p>
        <p>It was better than nothing at least.</p>
        <p>
          The rest of the night, he spent resting in the den. He made sure to
          properly cover the den beforehand to avoid getting attacked by a
          demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The early morning light filtered through the trees, casting a peaceful
          glow over his hidden den.
        </p>
        <p>
          He woke up early in the morning, mostly recovered. His wounds had
          healed to a great extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Woah! My body feels as good as new!" he exclaimed excitedly as he did
          arm stretches. Although his body was still sore, he was no longer
          exhausted or seriously wounded.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, he went out and searched for a suitable demonic presence
          around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had the talisman of the third sister with him, but he didn't know
          which demon was inside. If it was something weak, he would rank lower.
          He didn't want to bet on this.
        </p>
        <p>It was a risky bet after all.</p>
        <p>
          He saw a few demons, but they were all handled quickly. Not much
          effort.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had time until the afternoon before the demon hunt event ended, so
          he needed to get a demon before the deadline.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the elders had seen his strength, it was not mandatory for
          him to keep hiding it. If he did, he would only turn out more
          suspicious instead.
        </p>
        <p>He might as well get something out of it.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 78 &nbsp;Nadia spotted. Minor-level demons!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 78</p>
        <p>"Hmm…?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver craned his neck as he sensed someone nearby. He had been
          continuously hunting demons for two hours, but so far, he was not able
          to find a good demon. He felt the forest was too easy! At least, to
          him…
        </p>
        <p>
          What he didn't know was that if the other children heard him, they
          would not hesitate to beat him black and blue for saying something so
          outrageous. They had been struggling to fight these bloodthirsty
          creatures. Demons were tough opponents for them, and they were the
          same age as Oliver too.
        </p>
        <p>Rustle…</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, he heard something as he neared the water stream. The sound
          wasn't close by, but his keen ears picked it up. He felt time was
          running out, and he had yet to hunt something good.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could almost feel the adrenaline pumping through his veins. As he
          neared the sounds, he could somehow make out the sounds, it was as if
          someone was fighting.
        </p>
        <p>
          He decided to follow the sound and moved toward its direction. It took
          him a few minutes to cover the distance and reach the exact location…
        </p>
        <p>
          He saw an unexpected scene. It was Nadia. And she was engaged in
          combat with two demons alone. Sensing the feeling of dread, Oliver
          quickly realized these demons were the real deal.
        </p>
        <p>Minor-level demons!</p>
        <p>
          He immediately remembered the elder's words. He looked towards her,
          still some distance away, hiding in the bushes. He doubted she sensed
          him, especially while fighting two minor-level demons at once.
        </p>

        <p>Screeech!</p>
        <p>He looked at the demons…</p>
        <p>
          One shrieked, jangling chains, a short being of sickness and thunder.
          Two vicious eyes glared at her with absolute darkness. Another shriek
          resonated from its crooked mouth as Nadia brutally stabbed its side.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the other demon… A lush head of hair adorned its inflated
          head, almost bark-like. Constant snoring escaped the creature's
          sinuous nostrils set within a bony nose. Its head sat atop a thick,
          stringy body. Runes or emblems, each glowing brightly, covered parts
          of its torso.
        </p>
        <p>'That…'</p>
        <p>
          The creature rushed forward, its two legs gracelessly carrying its
          wicked body with frightful energy. A muscular tail snaked behind it,
          electric energies pulsing with every movement.
        </p>
        <p>'A thunder-attributed demon…'</p>
        <p>
          The creature's eyes were still fixed on her. Oliver just observed from
          afar. It seemed she was having trouble dealing with two minor-level
          demons on her own.
        </p>
        <p>
          While she was not injured, and the demons were bleeding, she was still
          unable to subdue them properly. If he was not wrong, she wanted to
          seal a living demon in her talisman by weakening it. She didn't expect
          another demon to ambush them as well. Now, the two demons tactically
          worked together to suppress her and would probably later duel to see
          who would eat her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw the demon roar and lunge at Nadia, bits of thunder and
          electricity crackling around its body. Nadia, who still had to awaken
          her elemental attribute, dodged and slashed its back. The demon was
          furious that its prey had once again dodged and it couldn't feed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even among minor-level demons, a demon with an espera attribute was
          rare, so it was unfortunate for Nadia to encounter one. The second
          demon took this chance and attacked her from behind with its muscular,
          veiny arms. Nadia dodged by a hair's breadth, jumping over the demon.
          She was extremely flexible and strong, not easily defeated by the two.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's mind raced. "Should I intervene? Would she appreciate the
          help or see it as interference?" He knew that stepping in could change
          everything. But watching her struggle stirred something inside him.
        </p>
        <p>He had some guesses why she was in such a situation.</p>

        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>Bam! n/o/vel/b//in dot c//om</p>
        <p>
          Nadia dodged the tail attack by a narrow margin. The demons in front
          of her were ferocious and really wanted to kill her. It was the first
          time she experienced such killing intent. It made her realize many
          things.
        </p>
        <p>Demons were cruel and would not hesitate to tear you apart.</p>
        <p>They were clever and liked to play tricks.</p>
        <p>
          Never trust them. Kill them mercilessly whenever the opportunity
          presents itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't want to ruin this situation by killing the two demons. If a
          living demon was sealed, she might be recognized more since it was
          harder to seal a live demon than a dead one. She had to weaken them to
          the point where they couldn't resist and then use her talisman to seal
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she found it hard to do. She wondered which demon she should kill.
          Not to mention, the thunder was annoying to deal with. It was agile
          and numbing, slowing her speed whenever she took a direct hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every attack she dodged took a toll on her energy. "I can't keep this
          up forever," she thought, her frustration mounting. Sweat dripped down
          her forehead, stinging her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          This demon was tougher than all the weaker demons she had killed so
          far. She coldly snorted and sent a wave of espera towards the
          demon—pushing it back. She wanted to control everything without using
          any secret techniques or too much espera. She was superior to these
          demons. Minor-level demons were nothing to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even as she reassured herself, doubt crept in. "Am I really strong
          enough?" The thought was fleeting, but it stung.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pressure of living up to her mother's expectations weighed heavily
          on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had to prove this to her mother. She was watching her. She had to
          show that even without using precious clan techniques, she could deal
          with these minor threats on her own. If she did that, then perhaps her
          mother would praise her.
        </p>
        <p>Rustle… Rustle…</p>
        <p>
          She suddenly heard some movement behind her and sensed a human
          presence. Her expression turned a little ugly. It was already tough
          dealing with two demons, but now someone else was coming. If that
          person turned out to be hostile, she might be in serious trouble. She
          was confident but not overconfident; facing three enemies at once
          would be very difficult.
        </p>
        <p>Her eyes darted around, searching for the source of the sound.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 79 &nbsp;Sealing the demon!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 79</p>
        <p>Rustle…</p>
        <p>
          She warily looked in the direction of the sound and saw someone
          familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You again!?" she exclaimed, unable to hide her surprise. It seemed
          like this guy was always around, no matter where she went.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter how hard she tried to avoid him, fate seemed to push them
          together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yet, for some inexplicable reason, a strange, familial feeling surged
          in her heart whenever she saw him.
        </p>
        <p>She couldn't quite figure out why.</p>
        <p>"Hey?" Oliver waved.</p>
        <p>
          The demons' attention was quickly drawn to the new prey that had
          entered the scene. Their eyes gleamed with ferocity as they moved
          slowly yet cautiously, sizing him up.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here to help!" he shouted, retrieving the last weapon he had on him—a
          pair of daggers.
        </p>
        <p>
          He hadn't used them before because he lacked control over them, but
          with his other weapons out of commission, he had no choice but to
          resort to them. Despite not being needed here, the presence of two
          minor-rank demons spurred him to join the fight.
        </p>
        <p>
          "YO! DEMONS, COME AT ME!" he yelled, causing the two demons to flinch
          and then turn even more aggressive.
        </p>

        <p>Growl…</p>
        <p>
          One demon, with muscular arms and a tail, charged at him with angry
          eyes and a salivating mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver remained calm. Instead of dodging, he waited for the demon to
          get closer. As it neared, he pressed down on the ground beneath his
          feet with force, propelling himself into the air. His body formed an
          arc as he threw one of his daggers straight at the demon's eye.
        </p>
        <p>ROAR!</p>
        <p>
          The demon wailed in agony and pain as the sharp metal lodged itself in
          its eye. Oliver landed gracefully behind the demon and, taking
          advantage of its disoriented state, rushed forward to stab its back
          with his other dagger. But the dagger couldn't penetrate the demon's
          tough skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          He silently marveled at the demon's tough hide, realizing it could
          fetch a high price.
        </p>
        <p>
          The muscular demon grew even more aggressive, almost berserk, as it
          charged madly at anything nearby. Oliver continued his attacks, but
          they were less effective than against weaker demons.
        </p>
        <p>Just then, he heard Nadia's voice from afar.</p>
        <p>
          "You're using a low-quality weapon against a demon. It's ineffective!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver knew she was right. His cheap weapons were no match for the
          demon's muscular body. He looked into the demon's black eyes,
          seamlessly activating his [Cosmic Void Gaze] ability.
        </p>
        <p>[Enshrouding of Death]</p>
        <p>
          A frightened cry escaped the demon's mouth as its eyes began to lose
          focus. Oliver appeared in front of the demon, and before it could
          faint from fear, he stabbed his dagger through its face.
          Simultaneously, he extracted the dagger from its eye and plunged it
          into the demon's chest with all his strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          The power of Level-4 strength showed as his entire hand sank inside
          the demon's body due to the terrible force. The demon was killed
          instantly.
        </p>

        <p>
          This all happened in less than a moment. Oliver used [Cosmic Void
          Gaze] while rushing toward the berserk demon. He activated it so
          quickly that no one could comprehend what was happening, drawing
          attention to the act of his hand sinking into the demon's thick skin.
          n/o/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>He had successfully hunted the demon.</p>
        <p>
          Even if someone from the outside, including the elders, saw this
          scene, they would not find anything abnormal. And even if someone
          keenly sensed something amiss, there would be no proof, as he had
          killed the source of information—the demon. They wouldn't be able to
          extract any information.
        </p>
        <p>
          At best, they could only harbor suspicions about why the demon had
          suddenly become docile and unstable, allowing Oliver to attack it. He
          could easily deflect such questions by claiming he was too quick and
          took the demon off-guard in its berserk state.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>He retrieved his talisman and slapped it against the demon.</p>
        <p>Vrrr…</p>
        <p>
          A vibration was produced before a gray light shone from the talisman,
          slowly enveloping the demon and sealing it inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this, it could be said that he had successfully completed the
          demon hunt.
        </p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          He heard a booming sound and turned around to see Nadia throwing the
          thunder demon against a nearby tree. She moved fast, not letting the
          demon get back up before stabbing her sword through its abdomen.
        </p>
        <p>The demon screeched in pain—a wail of pure misery.</p>
        <p>
          She was ruthless, quickly using her talisman and throwing it against
          the demon's body. A light shone as the demon struggled and resisted,
          but after a futile struggle of a severely wounded demon, it was sealed
          for good.
        </p>

        <p>She had managed to seal a live demon!</p>
        <p>
          "Good work!" Oliver congratulated her from afar. She looked at him
          with a serene expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          She hadn't expected to meet him here, let alone see him draw a demon
          towards himself.
        </p>
        <p>Did he think she needed help?</p>
        <p>The thought made her a bit pissed off. She was not weak.</p>
        <p>
          She felt a twinge of anxiety—surely he didn't think she was weak,
          right? It wasn't that she couldn't handle the two demons on her own;
          she was simply adamant about capturing and sealing the demon alive by
          weakening it.
        </p>
        <p>It was nothing more than that.</p>
        <p>
          She worried Oliver might think she was weak and had intervened to help
          her.
        </p>
        <p>But she was more powerful than he might realize.</p>
        <p>
          In fact, she had strategically chosen to weaken the demon before
          sealing it, ensuring a successful capture. She wasn't struggling—she
          was being methodical and precise.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, the idea that Oliver might see her as incapable gnawed at her
          pride. She wanted to prove herself, to show that she could handle
          whatever came her way without anyone's help... Her mother...
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, oblivious to her internal struggle, approached her. "You did
          great out there," he said with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          She calmly looked at him without any fluctuations in her expression,
          trying to mask her irritation. "I had it under control."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know you did," he responded, his tone was calm. "But it never hurts
          to have a backup, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She nodded, but the words didn't quite alleviate her frustration. She
          didn't need a backup. She needed to prove her strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they prepared to leave, the memory of the fight lingered in her
          mind. The adrenaline, the rush of combat, and the satisfaction of
          sealing a demon were still fresh. Yet, amidst all that, the shadow of
          doubt persisted.
        </p>
        <p>'How did he become this strong…?'</p>
        <p>'And what was that… the demon…'</p>
        <p>She silently glanced at Oliver's back…</p>

        <h2>Chapter 80: Demon Hunt is Over!</h2>
        <p>
          She was more powerful than him. She really did not want him to think
          of her as someone weak. She had once cried in front of him too. That
          was the most embarrassing moment in her entire life… she still
          couldn't get over it.
        </p>
        <p>
          If Oliver actually thought that she was just a crybaby, she had to
          show him her powers. Somewhere in the corner of her mind, she didn't
          want to lose the respect of her twin... She had never cared about such
          things before, but for some reason, she did not want this
          now—especially not with him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at the same time, she felt angry at herself. Why did she have to
          explain anything to him? She was not liable to give anyone any
          explanation about her powers except her mother!
        </p>
        <p>'Ugh!'</p>
        <p>
          She felt a burst of frustration in her mind, so she couldn't help but
          glare at him. How could she know that at that moment, Oliver was just
          stunned at how ruthless a child could be? He had first-hand witnessed
          the ruthlessness of a future powerhouse today.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that she was so strong to handle two demons alone. Even if he
          had not helped, she might have subdued them on her own sooner or
          later, especially if she had used those powerful secret techniques
          from the clan and her special eyes.
        </p>
        <p>He saw her glaring at him and was suddenly puzzled.</p>
        <p>'Wait! She's not angry with me because I stole her prey, right?'</p>
        <p>
          He felt a bit anxious. He didn't want to worsen his relationship with
          this cold doll. He had seen how, at such times when the protagonist
          helped them, they would rather fight the protagonist for stealing
          their prey.
        </p>

        <p>
          But she had such a complex mind that he often found it hard to do
          things that sat well with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head and didn't think much but calmly picked up his
          talisman. Since they had used up their talismans, they were allowed to
          exit the forest if they wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          He saw Nadia give him one more angry look before turning around and
          picking up her own talisman. She looked towards the sky for a moment,
          then back at him.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmph."</p>
        <p>
          She soon left the scene, possibly going back to the starting entrance.
          She didn't want to think about it; she was more curious about
          something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          Earlier, she had seen the demon suddenly freeze in its spot as Oliver
          rushed towards it. From the sounds it made, the demon had definitely
          been stunned or dazed to even react. Did he perform some sort of
          hypnosis on the demon?
        </p>
        <p>Not only that, but his strength... what had happened to him?</p>
        <p>
          The last time she saw him, he was not even strong enough to fight the
          siblings back, but now he was manhandling a minor-level demon on his
          own? This was not something that could change overnight.
        </p>
        <p>
          She fell into some thoughts. Perhaps he had once again gotten his
          hands on another body-strengthening elixir and used it himself. This
          did seem to make sense. Last time he had come to her courtyard, he was
          carrying a black box too and intended to give it to her, but she had
          decisively refused it at that time. So there was a chance he had used
          the elixir in the box himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had some guesses but decided not to dwell on it. She was totally
          not interested in his business!
        </p>

        <p>________________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver also fell into thought. What should he do now? His hunt was
          pretty much over anyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should he go and rob others? Oliver was amused when he thought about
          it but decided against it. He didn't have that much energy left. It
          would be too petty, and he doubted they had anything worthwhile on
          them in this forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          He too went towards the starting point. It was in the east direction,
          so he only had to follow that path, and sooner or later he would be
          there.
        </p>
        <p>
          On his way back, he met other participants too. The time for the hunt
          was almost over, and now everyone was returning to the exit. The
          demons nearby didn't dare come closer to the crowd of children,
          sensing the huge quantity of espera radiating from the group. So
          overall, it was an easy trip back.
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>
          "The demon hunt is now officially over. Those who are still inside
          will be brought back, and the rest of you will now showcase the demons
          you have caught to the elders."
        </p>
        <p>
          The same elder from before, with a demonic bird as a familiar,
          appeared once again. He kindly instructed the children.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were all the cream of the crop in the clan and had great
          potential. He might even consider taking in one of them as his
          personal student after discussing it with their families or them.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes couldn't help but wander to a white-haired head in the crowd,
          the distinct sign of royalty in the group. He was among the other
          elders and had seen the stunt of this little guy at that time. He was
          ruthless and didn't hesitate to cripple the two siblings either.
        </p>
        <p>
          After they were brought out of the forest, a team of medics who were
          on standby immediately examined their conditions. They both had been
          crippled badly, and if not provided with a healing elixir, they would
          remain that way forever. He had directly crushed their talents and
          potentials.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could feel that there was an inside story between the two parties.
          It was as if they had known each other from before this demon hunt.
          From their actions, it could be related to the small conflict that
          happened during the gathering before the hunting event or a matter of
          revenge between the two. Their eyes were filled with hatred for one
          another.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a small matter, but what he was more interested in was Oliver's
          abilities. He had clearly felt it, but Oliver was just an ordinary
          child with less than average espera quantity in his body. It was
          impossible to believe that he could pull off those two unknown
          powerful techniques. Those techniques had potential to develop into
          even more fearsome abilities later on.
        </p>
        <p>
          How in the world did he manage to obtain those techniques? And who
          created those fearsome techniques in the first place?
        </p>
