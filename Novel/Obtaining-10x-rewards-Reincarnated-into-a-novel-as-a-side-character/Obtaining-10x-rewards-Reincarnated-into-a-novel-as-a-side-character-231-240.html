        <h2>Chapter 231 &nbsp;First heart? Replenishing Abyss Energy!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 231</p>
        <p>
          'If I leave them be for some time, they will most probably think that
          the human intruder has left the city and won't stay here long. In that
          time, I can prepare as well.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver thought to himself as he watched Sera, deep in thought, her
          eyes closed as if contemplating something.
        </p>
        <p>A few minutes later, she too left the abandoned temple.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's muscles tensed, but he maintained his calm, waiting until her
          footsteps faded completely. Only then did he discreetly move to the
          back of the temple rather than following her. For all he knew, there
          might be more demons lurking around the vicinity.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also had to think about the problem of his unique scent; he had to
          somehow mask it. He had been careless and didn't consider, in his
          excitement, that there could be demons adept at such detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even if he had anticipated it, he wouldn't have expected to encounter
          such skilled demons so early after arriving in their lands.
        </p>
        <p>
          'I was too excited when I first arrived here… thought I could outsmart
          every demon in my path,' he silently chastised himself as he lowered
          the Abyss energy to a minimum. His already low reserves were even more
          depleted now that he had been using it to conceal himself.
        </p>
        <p>'Wait, Abyss energy…'</p>
        <p>
          Combined with the [Cloak of Darkness], it would work decently now that
          he was some distance from the demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          A small black bottle suddenly appeared in his hand, its surface smooth
          and matte as his storage bracelet glinted in the faint light seeping
          into the temple.
        </p>
        <p>Pop!</p>

        <p>
          With a popping sound, he opened the lid of the bottle and swiftly
          poured the contents over his head, specifically onto his hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the liquid was completely absorbed into his hair, he began
          rubbing it like shampoo, and in a matter of seconds, his pristine
          white hair began to darken, ultimately becoming black!
        </p>
        <p>
          His reflection in a shard of broken glass revealed someone else
          entirely. Gone was the unmistakable mark of the Mystic Purge Clan
          heir.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a special hair dye he had bought long ago in case of
          emergencies like this. He didn't want any demon to recognize his
          identity at any cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman, Sera, knew about his mother, Ophelia, the Death Witch. She
          must have a lot of information on the Mystic Purge Clan as well. His
          white hair would definitely give him away to demons like her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, with his hair completely black, he looked entirely different from
          before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, very few people had seen his face, so it would be hard
          to recognize him from afar, especially in the demon lands.
        </p>
        <p>
          After making sure his hair was completely dyed, he quickly pulled out
          his compact mirror to double-check. His lips twitched at the sight. "I
          almost look like a regular demon under this light."
        </p>
        <p>
          If not for the horns or other racial features, he could try to
          disguise as a common demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          After ensuring his hair was completely black, he did something
          unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand blurred as the carcass of the dead chimera appeared before
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes turned cold, and with a swift motion, Oliver plunged his hand
          directly into the chimera's chest.
        </p>
        <p>Crunch!</p>

        <p>
          The sound of flesh being torn filled the air as he withdrew his hand,
          holding a glowing blue bead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, it did have a core after all," he muttered under his breath, his
          lips curling slightly. "How could it not have a core… I knew it would
          definitely have one."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's lips curled as he gazed at the glowing bead, which was
          essentially the heart of the chimera, formed after sacrificing
          multiple lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The core of the chimera served to aid all its functions and was
          essentially its life source.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver had kept the chimera's body to sell later or use for materials,
          but he had been thinking about a way to retrieve its heart. This had
          been troubling him, given that his Abyss energy was low.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite being an artificial being, the chimera still had its own
          'heart,' which served similar functions.
        </p>
        <p>
          So he felt he might just be able to recover his Abyss energy by
          consuming the chimera's core!
        </p>
        <p>
          Without hesitation, Oliver placed the shiny bead in his mouth and
          swallowed it like a pill.
        </p>
        <p>
          A hot sensation instantly spread from his throat to his chest, then to
          every inch of his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fiery surge of power hit him almost immediately. His eyes widened as
          an intense heat radiated from the core, sending waves of energy
          spiraling through his veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt a strange sense of ecstasy wash over his mind, as if he had
          eaten the best thing in the world. His mouth started watering
          involuntarily.
        </p>
        <p>
          A burst of primal power coursed through his soul. His mind was
          influenced by instincts and desires, urging him to seek more hearts,
          more power. He felt an insatiable hunger, unlike anything he had ever
          experienced, as if he were no longer human but a monster.
        </p>
        <p>
          This growing hunger made him realize that consuming the core was
          causing him to lose control. He quickly began calming himself,
          focusing hard to suppress those unwanted instincts.
        </p>

        <p>
          He felt hot, as if something within him was constantly changing while
          he focused on controlling his psyche.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Oliver was alone, focusing on maintaining control, a subtle
          change occurred. His form flickered for a moment, and his pristine
          white skin turned pitch black, almost resembling the chimera he had
          exorcised when it was just born.
        </p>
        <p>
          His fingers twitched involuntarily, curling into claws for a split
          second before returning to their normal form.
        </p>
        <p>
          The transformation was brief, lasting less than an instant, before
          returning to normal, with his smooth white skin restored.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't notice the change, as he was too focused on his mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          But something had definitely occurred at a deep level. What exactly?
        </p>
        <p>He hadn't the faintest idea.</p>
        <p>"My Abyss energy is overflowing now."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver let out a satisfied grin as he felt the Abyss energy flooding
          his body. Not only had it recovered, but it also seemed to have
          increased by a whole level.

        <h2>Chapter 232 &nbsp;Mystery? Vasoth's plan!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 232</p>
        <p>
          After the breakthrough, not only had his strength and Espera leveled
          up, but his charisma had increased as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exorcists were known to maintain eternal youth if they so desired.
          With each rank, they gained more vitality and power, granting them
          longer lifespans and youth.
        </p>
        <p>'I'm getting stronger faster than I expected,' he mused.</p>
        <p>
          'Hmm, now that this is taken care of, I need to search for those
          things.' A glint of purpose flickered in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had some items in mind even before coming here; those things were
          only present in the demon lands. He needed them for his secret weapon
          to be made.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had already gathered quite a few materials beforehand. Only a few
          things were remaining.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, drawing on his knowledge from the novel, knew how many
          fortunes the demon lands held for both exorcists and demons.
        </p>
        <p>It would be a shame to pass up such opportunities.</p>
        <p>
          'Moreover, there are quite a few important characters who should be
          pretty weak now, right?'
        </p>
        <p>
          His grin broadened as he realized that the greatest treasure trove
          might be something else entirely, beyond just resources.
        </p>

        <p>'But first… survival comes before everything else.'</p>
        <p>
          He walked out through the temple's back exit. With his Abyss energy
          overflowing, he no longer feared the inquisitors finding him anytime
          soon.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the inquisitors had planned, the entire city was sealed off, and
          there were no exits left unsupervised. The guards were suddenly on
          high alert, and the civilians panicked.
        </p>
        <p>
          All they were told was that the inquisitors were doing a routine
          inspection, nothing more. But how could the civilians not worry when
          even the gates to their city were sealed off, as if to cage something
          inside?
        </p>
        <p>
          Nevertheless, there was some unrest, but that was all. Most of the
          citizens had absolute faith in the inquisitors and felt at ease with
          three of them in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inquisitors had a great reputation and strength. It was not shocking
          that citizens were relieved, even though the entire city was suddenly
          closed with no prior notice or announcement.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Still, I have to stay cautious,' Oliver thought to himself. 'Faith in
          their power only means more scrutiny. I can't afford to slip up now.'
        </p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>"Have you found anything yet, Vasoth?"</p>
        <p>The red-haired demon from earlier asked his colleague.</p>
        <p>
          The demon was tall with delicate humanoid features, but instead of
          ears, he had two long fins. His features were a mix of masculine and
          feminine, giving him a bizarre appearance for a male demon.
        </p>
        <p>He resembled a beautiful man, if it had to be described.</p>
        <p>"Not yet, Drul," he smiled in a gentle yet ominous manner.</p>

        <p>
          "Tsk! Where has the pest gone off to!? If I get my hands on him, I
          swear I will tear him apart limb by limb." The red-haired Drul was
          fuming, his sandy eyes churning continuously.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth remained silent and maintained his polite smile, his eyes
          narrowed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stared at the cloudy sky, his red eyes slightly revealed as he
          thought to himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Impressive…' he thought, his eyes glowing slightly under the
          yellow-tinged clouds.
        </p>
        <p>
          'One highly skilled... I can't feel a trace of him, almost as if... he
          never existed in the first place. How impressive.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth's deep red eyes glowed under the yellow light from the sulfuric
          clouds as he found himself amused.
        </p>
        <p>'Just who are you, human?'</p>
        <p>
          This was the first time a human had ever escaped his senses. His
          family was known for their terrifying tracking abilities. Despite
          being weaker, his senses rivaled those of the captains, even slightly
          enhanced.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was extremely curious about the person who could deceive his
          senses. He really wanted to meet this human. He was sure the human was
          still in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Damn it!" Drul kept grumbling in anger as he looked around and saw
          something in the distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          He walked forward, and soon enough, Vasoth saw what Drul was
          approaching.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were two humans dressed in tattered rags, dirt sticking to their
          faces, their swollen features making them almost unrecognizable as
          human.
        </p>

        <p>
          What stood out among the two were the thick metallic collars around
          their necks. Their hands were shackled together with chains, allowing
          little to no freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Disgusting slaves!" Drul strode forward and kicked one of the slaves
          in the chest. The impact from the demon's kick was ridiculous, and the
          human man coughed out his insides before bursting into a bloody mess
          all over the road.
        </p>
        <p>Thump!</p>
        <p>
          The other human slave fell backward, his eyes filled with fear as he
          trembled, shivering under Drul's dangerous gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was endless disgust in those sandy yellow eyes, as if they were
          looking at something worse than a worm.
        </p>
        <p>"Filth like you shouldn't even breathe near me."</p>
        <p>
          "How dare you get in my sight, you despicable wretch!" Drul raised his
          arm to kill the other human slave, but a hand stopped him.
        </p>
        <p>He turned to see Vasoth holding his arm with a smile.</p>
        <p>
          "What is it, Vasoth!? Let go of my hand, or I won't care about your
          identity either." Drul glared at him with a murderous gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          He couldn't stand being looked down upon, and not to mention, he did
          whatever he wanted. No one had the authority to stop him except the
          captain.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Drul, why bother with these slaves? Look, their owner seems scared
          silly." Vasoth pointed at a fat demon with a patchy face and a fearful
          gaze, too terrified to step forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You'll only be destroying their property. Didn't the captain ask us
          to improve the image of the inquisitors?" he added in a calm tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon hearing the word 'captain,' Drul snorted, shook off Vasoth's
          grip, and walked away without looking at the slave again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth simply smirked and turned to face the owner. "They belong to
          you, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, yes, respected sir. I am just a mere slave merchant. These two
          slaves were recently shipped here to serve as breeding livestock." The
          merchant hurried forward, his hands nervously clasped, his face
          dripping with sweat. n/o/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't dare speak too much or disrespect the inquisitor, fearing he
          might be charged with suspicion and tortured to death. Everyone knew
          how fearsome the inquisitors were.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm..." Vasoth's face was dangerously still as he stared at the
          remaining human slave. A cruel idea flashed through his mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the slave merchant. "You know about other human slaves in
          the city?"
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 233 &nbsp;The city is sealed! Gather the slaves?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 233</p>
        <p>"You know about other human slaves in the city?"</p>
        <p>
          "Pardon? Ah, yes, I am familiar with most of the slave merchants in
          the city," the merchant hurriedly answered. He was confused as to why
          the inquisitor was interested in that topic.
        </p>
        <p>
          The smile on Vasoth's face broadened slightly. "Good," he said. "How
          much time would it take for you to gather all the human slaves in the
          city in one place?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "This… um, it would normally be impossible to gather all slaves from
          other merchants so quickly, but if we use the inquisitor's authority,
          then it shouldn't take more than a few days," the merchant thought and
          shared his estimation.
        </p>
        <p>"Do it," Vasoth ordered.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, sir, but may I ask why respected Inquisitor is interested in
          livestock?" The merchant couldn't help but ask despite his fear of the
          inquisitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          If it had been Drul instead of Vasoth, he wouldn't have dared to ask
          such a question, but Vasoth seemed more approachable. He had even
          helped stop Drul from killing his property.
        </p>
        <p>So, he hesitated but asked in the end.</p>
        <p>
          "To catch a big and clever rat." Vasoth laughed and left, leaving
          behind a confused fat merchant.
        </p>

        <p>"A rat…?"</p>
        <p>
          The merchant didn't quite understand what the inquisitor meant, but he
          quickened his pace as he dragged the slave away to meet with the other
          merchants of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter what, since the inquisitor had ordered it and with the
          recent sealing of the city, there was definitely something going on
          behind the scenes. Perhaps he could get a hint or two from his
          merchant friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew it wasn't wise to delay, and that perhaps he might learn
          something valuable from his fellow merchants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the city lord had to give face to an inquisitor. He couldn't
          imagine any merchant disobeying the order to hand over their human
          slaves.
        </p>
        <p>_________________</p>
        <p>
          A few days passed in the blink of an eye as Oliver surveyed the
          customs and practices of the demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demons of this city lived in a strict hierarchy where the weak had
          to obey the commands of the strong. It was a brutal world of fighting,
          violence, and madness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demons came in all sizes and shapes, which helped him blend in
          with just a simple cloak. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he couldn't truly disguise himself, his modified appearance
          and careful use of Abyss energy helped him move unnoticed in the
          city's darker, more chaotic corners.
        </p>
        <p>
          His scent, which almost gave him away, was properly masked by using
          mud. Of course, such a cheap trick wasn't enough to escape the sense
          of smell of that red-haired inquisitor, so he carefully used Abyss
          energy to keep his scent hidden.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt relying on Abyss energy wasn't the best solution. If he could
          learn alchemy properly, he would be able to produce a
          scent-neutralizing potion. At that point, even the most skilled demons
          would have a hard time detecting his scent.
        </p>

        <p>
          'I'll need to track down some alchemical ingredients when the time is
          right,' he noted, silently adding it to his growing list of
          objectives.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey, did you hear the rumors?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's ears picked up the sound of a conversation taking place. He
          was currently in a cheap, inconspicuous bar filled with shady, poor
          demons, sitting quietly in a corner.
        </p>
        <p>"What rumors?" a demon asked.</p>
        <p>
          "It seems the inquisitors have ordered the gathering of all the slaves
          around the city for some reason," the demonic companion whispered, but
          Oliver heard it clearly, his senses far beyond normal.
        </p>
        <p>"All the slaves in the city?" the demon asked in surprise.</p>
        <p>"No, not all, but all the human slaves."</p>
        <p>
          "What are they going to do with the livestock?" the other demon asked,
          sounding idiotic. "Could it be that they have a really big appetite
          and want to feast on all the slaves at once?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ha! As if they would want to eat something as lowly as slaves!
          They're used to delicacies."
        </p>
        <p>
          "HAHA! I heard that the skin of exorcists is especially delicate. I
          wonder how they taste!"
        </p>
        <p>"Keep dreaming. Be grateful if you even get the normal stuff."</p>
        <p>"Hmph, what's wrong with being a little greedy?"</p>

        <p>
          "It's not about greed. Those exorcists would kill demons like you and
          me in the blink of an eye."
        </p>
        <p>
          The other demon scoffed. "You think? Let me face one, and we'll see if
          I don't tear them apart with my claws!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon boasted, showing off his black, dusty claws. "I heard their
          bones are especially delectable!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Heh. If only! They say eating an exorcist can give us extensive
          vitality and even great powers!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The two demons laughed and ate, unaware of the cold gaze lingering on
          their backs.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver's eyes coldly stared at the two demons.</p>
        <p>
          One demon had three arms and one eye, while the other had a
          charcoal-like body.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes glowed slightly under the darkness of his hood as he
          pondered.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The demons abduct humans and use them as slaves, or worse. Humans
          serve as food for the demons, suffering the worst kind of treatment.
          It's basically torture. The inquisitors are gathering all the humans
          in one place? It's obvious what they're planning—to lure me out… hmm.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, Oliver wasn't the type to fall for such a simple bait. If
          he were a righteous exorcist with a strong sense of morality and
          justice, he would have walked right into this obvious trap to save the
          slaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was reminded of Evelyn, the kind of protagonist who would have gone
          out of her way to fall into such a trap to save everyone.
        </p>
        <p>But he was not her, and his ambitions stretched far beyond that.</p>
        <p>However…</p>
        <p>
          'Isn't this the perfect opportunity to get the highest quality
          hearts?'
        </p>
        <p>
          A thick, dark aura clouded behind Oliver, making all the demons
          present in the bar involuntarily shiver.
        </p>
        <p>A sinister smirk appeared on his face.</p>
        <p>
          'Since you want to provoke me, then don't blame me for being cruel.'
        </p>
        <p>
          His decision was swift—if they wanted to draw him out, he'd give them
          exactly what they wanted. But not on their terms.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 234 &nbsp;Two Fools Greet Death!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 234</p>
        <p>
          It was clear to him that the fate of all the slaves being gathered in
          one place was worse than death. Even if he had no attachment to them,
          they were still humans. As a fellow human, it wouldn't be fair if he
          didn't respond in kind.
        </p>
        <p>
          'If what I have in mind is possible, I might just be able to save the
          others.'
        </p>
        <p>But it wouldn't be for the slaves—it would be for his plan.</p>
        <p>
          Vasoth could never have imagined that their decision to seal off the
          city would only make it easier for Oliver to push his plan forward.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city was no longer a city—it was now a hunting ground. Oliver felt
          a dark thrill settle in his chest as he thought about it. It was only
          a matter of time before it became clear who was the hunter and who was
          the prey.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demons at the bar were confused. The sudden chill they all felt at
          the same time was inexplicable.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two demons who had been chattering earlier left the bar. Like the
          others, they too felt a sudden discomfort in the atmosphere, so they
          decided to leave.
        </p>
        <p>The table where Oliver had been seated was now empty.</p>
        <p>____________</p>

        <p>
          "Damn! I feel itchy on my back. What was that just now?" the
          green-skinned demon asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know. It was definitely not something good," his companion
          replied, shaking his head. He couldn't help but feel tense as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after the two had left the bar, the heavy feeling didn't leave
          them—it only intensified with each step they took.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were alone in the alley, and strangely, there was no one else
          around. Only their footsteps echoed in their ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each step felt heavier than the last as they continued walking in
          silence.
        </p>
        <p>Suddenly, a voice called out.</p>
        <p>"Hey."</p>
        <p>
          The two froze in their tracks. The heavy pressure intensified as soon
          as they stopped, as if they were carrying hundreds of rocks on their
          shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>
          The voice sounded like a child's, but for some reason, neither of them
          could turn around. It was as though they were frozen in place.
        </p>
        <p>Were they really frozen? No.</p>
        <p>
          They were shivering—a primal fear had taken hold of them, and neither
          dared to move.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their instincts told them that if they took just one step, they would
          die.
        </p>

        <p>
          The brave green-skinned demon with three arms from earlier gnashed his
          teeth, trying to push through the fear gripping him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He hadn't even seen the opponent's face, yet he was paralyzed with
          fear, shaking in his boots. His claws trembled violently.
        </p>
        <p>
          He and his companion had many enemies in the back alleys, and regular
          fights were not uncommon. It was survival of the fittest, just like
          anywhere else with demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he had never felt such a terrible sensation before. It was as if
          he were sitting inches away from the maw of a terrifying monster. If
          he moved, the monster would devour him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But even then, he was a hot-blooded demon and forced himself to face
          it. He let out a demonic scream and turned around to confront the
          owner of the voice.
        </p>
        <p>He saw it.</p>
        <p>
          His final sight. A boy in dark hooded clothes. A black hood concealed
          his features, but beneath that pitch-black darkness were two ominous
          orbs of death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Golden sulfuric clouds shimmered above him, and his visage looked
          almost as if... as if the grim reaper had ascended from hell.
        </p>
        <p>And that was all he saw before his vision turned upside down.</p>
        <p>
          Even as his head fell to the ground, only a single thought remained in
          his mind.
        </p>
        <p>'Is that what death looks like?'</p>
        <p>
          The companion barely moved, his gaze discreetly landing on his
          friend's body—or what was left of it. All he saw was a headless body
          and his companion's lifeless head lying neatly beside it.
        </p>

        <p>
          His blood ran cold as he saw the shadow of the enemy standing behind
          him. From the shadow, he could make out a long, sharp sword in the
          enemy's hands. He instantly realized that it had been the sword that
          beheaded his friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind raced through all their enemies, but he couldn't recall a
          single one who used a sword as a weapon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The shadow was clearly a master swordsman, a demon who lived by the
          sword. It wasn't the kind of brutal killing he had seen in alleyway
          fights. This was precision, something cold and professional. The
          precise cut was clean and smooth; he hadn't even realized when his
          companion was cut apart. It was all too smooth to be called a brutal
          murder.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, despite his companion's death, he didn't think of revenge. On
          the contrary, he thought of all the ways he could make himself useful,
          hoping the enemy would spare his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          His body trembled with fear, but he tried to keep a calm mind as he
          heard approaching footsteps.
        </p>
        <p>"Who do you serve, demon?"</p>
        <p>
          "Lord Gureon." He didn't hesitate to give the name of his boss. If it
          could make the enemy hesitate, it was worth it to save his life. But
          he doubted the shadow would care.
        </p>
        <p>
          The level of the lethal sword strike he had just witnessed far
          surpassed anything he had ever seen—completely beyond his realm of
          understanding.
        </p>
        <p>"Who is he, demon?"</p>
        <p>
          Another question came in a cold voice. The demon found it odd how the
          person kept addressing him as "demon," almost as if he wasn't one. It
          was understandable though; it felt like someone repeatedly addressing
          you as "human."
        </p>
        <p>
          But the demon ignored the strangeness and quickly replied, "Lord
          Gureon serves directly under the city lord and controls around 90% of
          the city's streets. She is the third most powerful demoness in the
          city, and everyone respects her. No one dares to challenge her in the
          city..."
        </p>
        <p>
          He mumbled the last part quietly, hoping the enemy would think twice
          before killing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he froze when he heard a cold series of laughter. His claws
          trembled as the ominous sound filled his ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          The laughter made his skin crawl. The enemy clearly didn't care about
          Lord Gureon. Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>
        <p>
          Why would such a terrifying being care about a demoness in the city?
          The thought terrified him even more.
        </p>
        <p>Who could be this bold in the city?</p>
        <p>______________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 235 &nbsp;Drul's suggestion! Demoness?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 235</p>
        <p>
          "J-Just to add, L-Lord Gureon is also quite precious to the city lord.
          T-They say she's the secret lover of the city lord," he blurted out in
          tension.
        </p>
        <p>"Take me to her."</p>
        <p>
          The voice spoke without a hint of emotion. The tone was cold, devoid
          of even a hint of hesitation. It was not a suggestion but a command.
        </p>
        <p>A command that, if refused, would cost him his life.</p>
        <p>
          "Y-Yes." The demon regained his composure, his eyes shining with a
          malicious glint.
        </p>
        <p>
          'What an arrogant fool! Once we're in Lord Gureon's turf, they'll skin
          him alive for killing one of her subordinates in her own area. Since
          he wants to die so badly, then follow me!'
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon let out a tense smirk, feeling that this arrogant demon
          behind him was overestimating himself, making things much easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon felt the pressure on him disappear. Without turning around,
          he began to walk forward, leading the arrogant fool to his death.
        </p>
        <p>____________</p>
        <p>
          "Sir Vasoth, these are all the human slaves that were present in the
          city. We have gathered them in the city square as per your
          instructions. Some of these slaves belonged to officials, but after
          hearing that it was you who wanted them, they didn't resist and handed
          them over."
        </p>

        <p>
          The merchant demon addressed Vasoth, who stood with a calm expression,
          his hands behind his back as he surveyed the abundance of human slaves
          before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were all collared, wearing dull and fearful expressions, unaware
          of the fate that awaited them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm…" Vasoth's lips curled into a sinister smile, his brows arching
          into crescent moons,&nbsp;a calculated glint appearing in his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beside him, the merchant looked at Vasoth with a respectful
          expression.
        </p>
        <p>"Vasoth! What are you doing with so much filth?"</p>
        <p>
          A loud voice came from behind him, and he turned with the same
          expression to see Drul's sullen face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul looked irritated as he strode toward Vasoth with large steps,
          scrutinizing the slaves with his piercing sand-colored eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Drul…" Vasoth smiled. "I thought of something fun… a little game to
          bring out the rat who infiltrated the city."
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul paused, glancing at Vasoth's expression before speaking. "You
          sure are one sick bastard."
        </p>
        <p>
          Then he burst into laughter, his laughter echoing amid the silent
          masses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth's gaze flickered, a hidden layer of emotion flickering in his
          otherwise calm expression, as he looked at the laughing demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul stopped laughing abruptly, looking at the shivering slaves in
          disgust.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do hope what you're planning works. I'm not one to think much, but
          if you manage to lure out the 'rat' you speak of, you can leave him to
          me," Drul said with a menacing grin.
        </p>

        <p>
          Vasoth pondered for a moment and said, "Sure. Sooner or later, he'll
          definitely be here. At that time, you can deal with him—as long as you
          don't kill him."
        </p>
        <p>"Why shouldn't I kill him?" Drul frowned.</p>
        <p>
          "Because there's something I need to know from him…" Vasoth said in a
          deep voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whatever. I'll kill him after that." Drul waved his hand and laughed
          as he walked off.
        </p>
        <p>But he suddenly stopped and turned back. "Hey."</p>
        <p>"Hmm?"</p>
        <p>
          "Did you inform the captain about this little stunt you're pulling
          here? I remember her saying something about improving our image...?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, she doesn't need to know about such trivial matters. We'll
          present her with the results later. I'm sure she won't say anything
          then. And honestly, I'm only improving our image here."
        </p>
        <p>"Huh? Improving…? How so?" Drul raised a brow.</p>
        <p>
          "Fear. The best way to keep them disciplined is through fear. They'll
          think twice before going against the rules set by their superiors.
          They'll know what happens when you try to rebel against the
          Inquisitors. A public display isn't so bad for this, right?" Vasoth
          smirked, looking at Drul with sly eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "HAHAHAHA! What a cunning bastard. I don't really care. Whatever
          happens, you're the one responsible for the aftermath. I hope you get
          what you're planning for, or else the captain won't be merciful."
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul said with a feral grin and a dangerous expression before jumping
          off and disappearing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth's expression remained stoic and eerily calm. It was hard to
          tell if he was angry or not by looking at his face.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Now then…" He turned around. "Merchant, hang them up and proceed with
          what I told you before."
        </p>
        <p>__________</p>
        <p>"BASTARD! Reveal your face!" n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om</p>
        <p>
          A demoness spoke with a tone of anguish and an expression of hatred;
          her current state was pitiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was kneeling on the ground, clutching her sliced-off right arm
          with her left hand, her nails nearly digging into her own skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her posture was tense, and there was a bloody scene surrounding her.
          Dozens of demons with bulky bodies and dangerously sharp claws lay
          scattered around, all cleanly sliced as if by a very sharp sword.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite their ferocious and intimidating appearances, they were now a
          tangled mess of blood and flesh. The stench of blood was thick in the
          enclosed space.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;The once-proud warriors of the city, reduced to mere remnants in
          the face of a single enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before the kneeling woman stood a boy shrouded in a dark cloak, hiding
          his features completely.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have strong ties with the city lord," the woman gritted her teeth
          and said. "If you kill me here, the city lord won't tolerate it. He is
          a Mid-level demon; think carefully about your actions—there's still
          time."
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman's blue face flushed red with anger and shame, forced to beg
          for her life by invoking the city lord's name. All her pride was
          crumbling, the image she had built, the power she held over the demons
          of the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Everything was on the verge of ending. She had to beg for her life.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver's eyes gleamed darkly as he listened to the demoness.</p>
        <p>
          As he watched the demoness grovel, Oliver couldn't help but feel a
          surge of satisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>'A Mid-level demon, huh.'</p>
        <p>
          Memories resurfaced in his mind as he recalled the power scaling for
          the demons. Unlike exorcists, who followed ranks, the demons had a
          different system.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were seven stages in a demon's entire life cycle. It was a sort
          of evolutionary process, where they evolved from a lower stage to a
          higher one after meeting certain conditions.
        </p>
        <p>'What were those stages?'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 236 &nbsp;Take it Raw?</h2>

        <p>
          <br />
          Chapter 236<br />
          'If I recall correctly, there were seven stages.'<br />
          Minor Demon: These were the weakest demons, often useless or naturally
          occurring in areas with low dark espera. They possess minimal power
          and are easily dispatched by even partially skilled exorcists.<br />
          These were the demons used in the clan's demon hunt event.<br />
          Low-Level Demon: Low-level demons are slightly stronger than minor
          demons and may possess more specialized abilities. They're still
          considered relatively weak and often serve as foot soldiers for
          higher-ranking demons.<br />
          For reference, the demoness was a low-level demon.<br />
          Mid-Level Demon: Mid-level demons are more formidable, possessing
          greater strength, speed, and intelligence compared to lower-ranked
          demons. They often have more complex abilities and serve as commanders
          or enforcers in demon hierarchies.<br />
          The city lord was supposedly at this level, while the inquisitors were
          more or less close.<br />
          High-Level Demon: High-level demons are among the most powerful
          entities encountered by exorcists. They possess immense strength,
          supernatural abilities, and definitely require advanced tactics and
          teamwork to defeat. High-level demons often serve as leaders or
          generals in demonic armies.<br />
          Catastrophic Demon: Catastrophic demons are extremely rare and possess
          power on a catastrophic scale. They are capable of causing widespread
          destruction and chaos, posing a significant threat to both humans and
          other demons.<br />
          These demons are typically ancient beings or entities of immense
          malevolence and power, requiring the combined efforts of multiple
          powerful exorcists to confront and defeat. Or a special Rank-5
          exorcist.<br />
          Two more classes of demons were yet to be revealed until the very late
          stages of the novel, known as the Apocalyptic and Primordial Demons.
          The rulers of the entire demon lands, these beings started it all from
          the beginning.<br />
          ________<br />
        </p>

        Seeing that the cloaked figure fell silent and didn't reply, the
        demoness couldn't help but grin tensely and say, "I can make you an
        offer."<br />
        "It's not too late. If you let me leave, this matter will be considered
        settled, and no one will bother you in the entire city. I can guarantee
        that for you."<br />
        "Leave?" Oliver finally spoke after a long silence, making the demoness
        pause. She realized that the voice was unmistakably childish and could
        not have belonged to an adult demon. Did this mean the figure was really
        a child and not a grown demon with a small body?<br />
        However, she quickly brushed it off and said, "Y-Yes, if you let me
        leave, I can give you wealth, slaves, and resources. I will even ask the
        city lord to grant you an official pos—"<br />
        "Why?"<br />
        "…What?" The demoness was stunned. She hastily said, "Did you not hear
        me!? The City Lord is a Mid-Level demon, a commander with countless
        soldiers serving under him. With your powers, he would definitely not
        treat you any worse than his closest subordinates. You can gain anything
        you want—"<br />
        "And I asked why?" Oliver tilted his head. "Why would I care about any
        of that? Why should I serve under him?"<br />
        "W-What…? A-Are you crazy? He's the lord of the city. As a demon, do you
        not wish to rise in rank!? Do you not have ambition?"<br />
        "A demon?" Oliver chuckled darkly, his voice laced with disdain. "Who
        said I am a demon?"<br />
        The demoness looked up, confused. Slowly, he removed the hood covering
        his head, and the light from the candles illuminated his face. The
        demoness's expression shifted from utter confusion to shock.<br />
        "HUMAN!?" she screamed, her eyes bloodshot with shock and fury.<br />
        "HUMAN! WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE!? WHY COULDN'T I DETECT YOUR SCENT!?"<br />
        She screamed, her fear now replaced by a tide of anger and fierceness,
        resembling a wounded beast.<br />
        Oliver's eyes gleamed coldly.<br />
        The demoness felt a chill in her heart as she looked at his ominous
        expression, his hair black as night, his eyes deeper than the bluest
        ink, and a face devoid of emotion.<br />
        "No… the city lord, the inquisitors, it all makes sense now… you are
        going to be dead soon… you will be murdered brutally…" she mumbled with
        a crazed look, her brows damp with sweat, her hands shaking.<br />

        Oliver looked down at her as if viewing a disgusting bug. The absolute
        lack of empathy in his gaze sent shivers down her spine. Her instincts
        screamed at her to run, to hide, to get as far as possible from the boy
        before her.<br />
        She growled, "Bastard, I will kill yo—"<br />
        A streak of cold light flashed between them.<br />
        "Strong words from a weak person."<br />
        Oliver spoke in an emotionless tone as he sheathed his sword back in its
        scabbard, the demoness's head sliced cleanly in two.<br />
        He didn't even glance at her fallen body, stepping past her as if she
        were nothing but trash in his path. He paid no heed to her threats;
        whether it was the city lord or the inquisitors, he already had plans
        prepared for them all.<br />
        'Her territory should cover the western side of the city, which means…'
        Oliver's eyes flashed with a cruel glint.<br />
        He looked at the demons laying around him. Moving to the demoness's
        corpse, he performed a basic exorcism and banished her soul to the
        void.<br />
        Next, his hand blurred and pierced her chest, extracting a blue,
        heart-shaped organ.<br />
        Oliver closed his eyes and took a deep breath, struggling to suppress
        the inner disgust and nausea as he brought the blue heart close to his
        face.<br />
        'It's a lamb's heart, it's a lamb's heart, it's a lamb's heart…' he
        chanted internally, trying to stave off the revulsion building within
        him.<br />
        Blood dripped continuously from the freshly extracted demon heart. He
        gave it a shake to dislodge the excess blood.<br />
        "Ugh!" He placed his palm over his mouth to stop himself from puking.<br />
        His stomach churned, but he forced himself to remember the stakes. He
        thought he had mentally prepared himself, but when it came to the act
        itself, the reality was overwhelming.<br />
        It gave him an extremely immoral and trashy feeling, as if he was about
        to commit a taboo. Perhaps the Path of Abyss was made for people who
        embraced taboos and became sinners to this world.<br />
        Another detail worsened it—the heart's shape. If it had resembled a
        chimera's heart, like a small bead, he might have been able to eat it,
        pretending it was a pill.<br />
        "No, if I want to survive in this cruel place full of demons who
        wouldn't hesitate to slaughter humans, I must accomplish this no matter
        how revolting it feels."<br />
        With a heavy stomach, he brought the dark blue heart closer to his
        lips.<br />
        'I can't afford weakness now,' he thought, steeling himself for what he
        had to do.<br />
        'Damn it, should I cook this first or eat it raw?'Nôv(el)B\\jnn

        <h2>Chapter 237 &nbsp;Eat or be Eaten!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 237</p>
        <p>
          His brows were knitted tightly, his eyes closed. The iron-like scent
          from the dried blood still lingered as he slowly parted his lips and
          took a small bite.
        </p>
        <p>
          The taste was metallic, bitter, and unsettlingly warm, making him gag,
          but he forced himself to chew. There was no particular taste—well,
          even if there was, he didn't want to feel it. He quickly stuffed the
          entire thing into his mouth and began chewing vigorously, running
          around in circles as if trying to distract himself from what was in
          his mouth.
        </p>
        <p>Gulp</p>
        <p>Finally, he managed to swallow the entire heart of the demoness.</p>
        <p>
          Instantly, he felt something—a strange heat spread all over him, while
          his mind felt as if it was being plunged into a bucket of ice. His
          body was hot, his mind cold, and a prickling sensation covered him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt a subtle change happening at his core; his usually calm Abyss
          energy began to stir and react violently, as though excited by
          something.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          His vision blurred, and an intoxicated feeling overcame him, like he
          had just drunk the strongest wine.
        </p>

        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          In the next moments, his entire body convulsed. Heat and cold clashed
          within him, the intense cold flooding his mind, as if frostbitten
          needles pricked every corner of his consciousness. His heart pounded
          erratically, each beat sending waves of heated energy through his
          veins, making his skin tingle as if jolted by a low current.
        </p>
        <p>Shiver!</p>
        <p>
          It felt as if his Abyss energy had come alive, writhing and pulsing
          beneath his skin, clawing to escape and consume more. He gasped, his
          breath visible like mist as freezing tendrils of energy swirled within
          his chest, meeting the fierce heat rising from his core. A violent
          shiver racked his body, not just from the cold but from thrill. The
          taste of power—the demoness's essence—was now his.
        </p>
        <p>
          With each heartbeat, he felt his senses sharpen, his mind both
          intoxicated and clear, able to see, hear, and feel in exquisite,
          overwhelming detail. His hands tingled, his vision flickered, and his
          veins surged with something dark and primal, like molten metal flowing
          beneath his skin. It was intoxicating and excruciating, as if every
          fiber of his being was being reforged from the inside out.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dark urge whispered within him, urging him to consume more, to seek
          even greater power. And then, with a final shudder, it settled. The
          fierce, electrifying energy coiled within him, waiting, like a beast
          at his command.
        </p>
        <p>
          He opened his eyes, feeling the world differently, almost as if
          shadows themselves leaned closer, whispering secrets that only he
          could now understand.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm… what is this…?"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver thought, sensing a change within himself. He could tell he had
          gained something from consuming the demoness's heart. He focused on
          identifying it and quickly found the answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A basic heat resistance trait? Interesting… does that mean I gain
          something unique every time I consume a heart?" He frowned, pondering.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, that's definitely not the case; there's something more complex at
          play here."
        </p>
        <p>
          He decided to test it out. Moving to the nearest demon, he swiftly
          extracted its heart, and, suppressing his disgust, swallowed it.
        </p>

        <p>
          All he felt was a subtle shiver—no new trait, just a slight increase
          in his Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So it's not guaranteed," he murmured, frustrated. "This must be
          random, perhaps. If I'm lucky or certain conditions are met, then
          maybe I'll receive a specific trait or ability from the creature whose
          heart I consume…"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wait, now's not the time to think about these things." He realized he
          was getting distracted; time was ticking away, and he had to hurry.
        </p>
        <p>His eyes turned cold as he surveyed the demons lying around him.</p>
        <p>
          "Forgive me; it's revolting, but necessary. Survival has no room for
          morals," he muttered, his voice low.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew the world was vaster than he had thought, with monsters beyond
          imagination lurking in the shadows, ready to devour the careless.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he didn't adapt, he would be just another casualty in this brutal
          world. He had to devour them before they devoured him. Eat or be
          eaten.
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>"What do you mean, he's disappeared?"</p>
        <p>
          Jenna paused, looking up with raised brows and an unmasked emotion as
          she looked down at her subordinate.
        </p>
        <p>"Where did he disappear to?" she asked.</p>
        <p>
          "This… I don't know, ma'am," the kneeling man replied, looking up. "As
          per your orders, I reached the city to keep him safe in case the clan
          exorcists found him. But by the time I arrived, he had already
          completed his mission in the playground." Nôv(el)B\\jnn
        </p>

        <p>
          "Already?" Her eyes flickered with surprise. She knew this was no
          random mission but one that would determine ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Black Codex Federation was extremely resourceful and had experts
          in divination. All the missions were meticulously designed and had
          deep significance to the organization.
        </p>
        <p>
          These missions were crafted to analyze the potential and capability of
          its members.
        </p>
        <p>And rank-change missions were especially challenging.</p>
        <p>Completing such a task so quickly bordered on the unbelievable.</p>
        <p>
          She had never heard of anyone completing a rank mission in a single
          day. It was almost absurd.
        </p>
        <p>Just how capable was he?</p>
        <p>
          What would his initial ranking turn out to be once he submitted the
          report?
        </p>
        <p>She felt an unexpected sense of anticipation.</p>
        <p>What was he hiding to have achieved this so quickly?</p>
        <p>
          She shuffled through the documents on her desk, retrieving a sheet of
          paper with the details of Oliver's mission.
        </p>
        <p>
          The specifics weren't written, only a rough description to find the
          root of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>She narrowed her eyes and made a brief call.</p>
        <p>
          "Paula, I sent you something. Look into it and see if you can find the
          details."
        </p>
        <p>
          She hung up and waited a while, soon hearing the notification ring.
          She picked up her phone, her eyes revealing a trace of evident
          surprise.
        </p>
        <p>Paula had sent her something that made her feel surprised.</p>
        <p>
          Even her subordinate noticed the shift in her expression; Jenna was
          rarely rattled by anything. This must be something extraordinary.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 238 &nbsp;The situation of Slaves!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 238</p>
        <p>
          What Jenna had just done was call a diviner from the organization and
          have her look into what exactly made the mission so easy for Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          A diviner was extremely special, blessed by the Great Oracle, and
          capable of seeing the future, delving into the past, or influencing
          the present with their abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of their best skills was finding or detecting something. It was
          nearly impossible to completely conceal your traces from a diviner's
          power unless protected by another diviner shielding your fate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Paula was an expert diviner and one of Jenna's close friends; she
          could easily find what had occurred at that location or reveal the
          mission's purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna refrained from asking for details of the exact events, as that
          would breach Oliver's privacy, and she wasn't interested in resorting
          to such tactics.
        </p>
        <p>
          All she wanted to know was the rank mission, and she received the
          details soon enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A chimera egg? Dark alchemists were involved?" Her brow furrowed as
          she read the report.
        </p>
        <p>
          She realized this matter was far from simple, especially for a novice
          exorcist. Even among rank missions, this one was particularly
          challenging.
        </p>
        <p>
          The organization must have considered Oliver's prestigious background
          and the Mystic Purge Clan when assigning this to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But according to Paula's findings, the chimera egg had been hidden by
          a special barrier technique that concealed it from the naked eye.
        </p>

        <p>
          It should have been impossible for a Rank-1 exorcist to see through
          it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did he use an artifact? Or maybe… something unique to the Mystic
          Purge bloodline?" She pondered, her mind racing with possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          A chimera, possibly Rank-2 or Rank-3, had been defeated by Oliver just
          like that? It was hard to believe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her curiosity about his methods was strong, but she suppressed it.
          Spying on her subordinates would diminish her dignity as their leader.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pressed her forehead, a smirk forming on her lips. "Oliver… that
          little kid. He never ceases to surprise me. A boy full of mysteries."
        </p>
        <p>"Hahaha…"</p>
        <p>
          She chuckled softly, her eyes gleaming with both admiration and
          intrigue.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kneeling man couldn't help but feel flustered. He had never heard
          her laugh like this before. She always exuded an air of strictness and
          authority, yet she was laughing now.
        </p>
        <p>"What happened afterward?" She paused and looked down.</p>
        <p>
          "Pardon?" The man was caught off guard by her sudden question but
          quickly responded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "After that, he suddenly left the playground. He seemed to have found
          the link to the chimera and went straight after the dark alchemists."
        </p>
        <p>He glanced up and saw Jenna's smile widen, so he continued.</p>
        <p>
          "It was a reckless move, I could tell. He rushed in without
          investigating the enemies' strength."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna maintained her smile, wondering if it was really reckless or a
          well-thought-out plan he had devised beforehand. n/ô/vel/b//in dot
          c//om
        </p>

        <p>
          "Then, he entered the basement where the dark alchemists were. I
          didn't follow, in case he sensed me, but I stayed on high alert. Time
          passed with no signs of action, which prompted me to check if
          everything was fine. But when I entered the basement…"
        </p>
        <p>"…All I saw was a black burning page."</p>
        <p>"Hmm? And?" she asked.</p>
        <p>
          "And, the heretics were lying unconscious. He had exorcised the man
          and placed a rough block on the female heretic to prevent her
          corruption. Before I could investigate further, I sensed multiple
          presences—all exorcists. It seems he reported the incident to the
          local police, so I had to retreat."
        </p>
        <p>"Young master Oliver was nowhere to be found…"</p>
        <p>
          Jenna's eyes narrowed, a dangerous glint flashing through them as she
          processed this information.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Interesting. A black burning page, you say? And he disappeared
          suddenly… So they had a teleportation scroll with them, huh?"
        </p>
        <p>She spoke with a sharp expression.</p>
        <p>
          "A teleportation scroll!? Miss, then young master…!" The man fell
          silent, realizing the implications.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If that's the case, then there's no telling where he might have been
          sent without knowing the coordinates. Quite the predicament, and I
          just asked Paula too." She sighed, rubbing her forehead.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Miss, what if young master is in danger?" he asked, unable to hide
          his concern. If something happened to Oliver, Jenna would suffer a
          huge loss directly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm…" Jenna tapped the desk thoughtfully. "I highly doubt it, given
          the circumstances you described. He had already exorcised both
          heretics. Chances are, he used the teleportation scroll voluntarily,"
          she reasoned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He used it knowingly!? What sort of madness…!" the man blurted out.
        </p>

        <p>Jenna looked at him calmly, saying nothing.</p>
        <p>
          His reaction was understandable. Using a teleportation scroll with
          unknown coordinates was akin to courting death.
        </p>
        <p>Even great adventurers would hesitate to take such a gamble.</p>
        <p>
          For all they might know, they could land in a lava pool or somewhere
          worse.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she couldn't deny that Oliver's willingness to take such a risk
          spoke volumes about his courage—and perhaps, his recklessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a very risky move by Oliver. What could his reason be for
          taking such a chance?
        </p>
        <p>Jenna's expression grew serious.</p>
        <p>"No matter what, I need to make sure he's still alive."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was too valuable an asset for her to lose. She would spend her
          extensive resources if it meant ensuring his safety.
        </p>
        <p>____________</p>
        <p>Meanwhile…</p>
        <p>"P-please s-spare m-me… great l-lord…"</p>
        <p>"Do it."</p>
        <p>"NO…!"</p>
        <p>Splatter!</p>
        <p>
          A fountain of blood erupted as one of the slaves was beheaded by the
          butcher demon wielding a blood-stained, serrated knife. The demon,
          with jagged teeth protruding from his mouth and cruel, sunken eyes,
          wore an apron soaked in old blood and bits of rotting flesh. His grin
          widened with each swing, savoring the thickening terror in the air.
        </p>
        <p>"Ahh… w-we a-are going to die…"</p>
        <p>
          A man, his neck choked by a thick, rusted collar, whimpered as he
          watched the headless corpse collapse, his eyes dull with horror.
          Dressed in filthy rags, he clutched at his collar as if it could
          protect him from his inevitable fate. His tear-streaked face and
          trembling body mirrored the hopelessness that gripped the crowd.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though they had long endured the demons' cruelty, the reality of their
          impending deaths shattered whatever shards of courage or pride they
          had clung to. Death was now within reach, a blood-soaked executioner
          dragging them, one by one, toward that final, agonizing moment.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 239 - The Defiant Girl! Will they kill her?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 239</p>
        <p>
          Some slaves wailed, crawling forward and clasping their hands,
          pleading to the Inquisitor. "Mercy, please…! I've done nothing wrong!"
          they cried, only to be met with a dismissive wave or the taunting
          smile of the Inquisitor, who leaned back as if lounging in his own
          court.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth's eyes glistened with twisted delight, sweeping over the
          desperate faces below. He looked almost serene, his calm demeanor a
          terrifying contrast to the chaos around him. Now and then, he would
          beckon to the butcher demon with a lazy flick of his finger, signaling
          him to bring forth the next sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demons in the crowd watched, licking their lips, delighting in the
          spectacle. Some were shouting mock encouragements at the slaves, while
          others laughed cruelly as they watched humans who had once stood tall
          now grovel and debase themselves. It was a theater of humiliation and
          despair, crafted solely for their amusement. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          One woman with a bruised face clawed at the ground, screaming for her
          owner in the crowd, "Master! Have mercy! Haven't I served well? Don't
          let me die like this!" Her voice cracked, dissolving into sobs, as her
          plea fell on indifferent ears. Her owner, a demon with red eyes like
          burning embers, chuckled, as if this was a reward rather than a
          punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cries of those begging and the sight of others lowering their
          heads to the cold, stone ground only fueled the demons' derision.
        </p>
        <p>
          They leaned forward, eagerly awaiting the next execution, like
          spectators waiting for the climax of an act. The horror was
          inescapable, each sound, each scent — the coppery tang of blood, the
          stale stench of fear — saturating the square.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Inquisitor's voice sliced through the din, calm yet commanding.
          "Is this all humanity is capable of? Such pathetic creatures… Or
          perhaps one among you still clings to bravery?" He paused, his gaze
          sweeping over the assembled slaves, as if expecting an answer.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silence that followed was suffocating, the slaves paralyzed by his
          words, unsure if any response would mean a quicker death or a
          temporary reprieve.
        </p>

        <p>
          Among the crowd, one small figure remained silent, her expression
          defiant. A young girl with short, coal-black hair and piercing purple
          eyes stared at the scene, her fists clenched tightly at her sides.
          Unlike the others, her gaze held neither fear nor submission, but an
          anger that burned as brightly as the torches around them.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't cry out, didn't lower her head; instead, she glared at the
          Inquisitor, her jaw clenched in silent defiance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl's eyes burned with a fierce resolve, a determination that had
          not yet been crushed by the endless suffering she had endured.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each swing of the butcher demon's knife, each plea from the slaves
          around her, only seemed to harden her resolve further. Her gaze
          remained fixed on the Inquisitor, and for a fleeting moment, his own
          eyes met hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth curled his lips, it seemed to amuse him to find her interesting
          as compared to other slaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hint of her defiance in her eyes made him want to crush her. He
          tilted his head slightly, studying her with a new glint of interest.
          Here was one who would not beg, who would not tremble. A rare
          specimen, almost too precious to destroy outright.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a smooth, calm voice that resonated with malice, he called out,
          "Bring the little one here."
        </p>
        <p>
          The demons in the crowd sneered, eager to see the spirited girl
          brought low. She was forced forward by a rough hand on her shoulder,
          but she didn't flinch. Her purple eyes remained unwavering, locked on
          the Vasoth, and she spat on the ground in a final act of rebellion.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, aren't you a bold little thing," Vasoth purred in a strange
          voice, his tone deceptively soft. "Tell me, child, do you think you're
          different from them?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She said nothing, her mouth pressed into a stubborn line. The other
          slaves around her fell silent, their sobs and cries fading as they
          watched her, a glimmer of shock—and perhaps hope—entering their hollow
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Inquisitor's smile grew wider as he leaned in, his eyes gleaming
          with mock curiosity. "Are you angry?" he asked, tilting his head as he
          studied her defiant expression. He waited, savoring the tension as the
          girl's purple eyes burned with barely contained fury.
        </p>

        <p>
          "How amusing," he continued, feigning a look of pity. "You must think
          yourself quite brave, don't you? But all I see is a little insect,
          writhing at the sight of a boot ready to crush it. Do you really think
          your anger matters here, little one?"
        </p>
        <p>
          His voice took on a mocking lilt, each word crafted to twist deeper
          into her pride. "Look around you," he sneered, gesturing to the crowd
          of broken, trembling slaves. "You're no different than them. Just
          another pitiful human, helpless and afraid. Do you truly believe your
          defiance means anything at all?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth wanted to feast on this girl's despair as she suffers, demons
          like him found such despair to be quite the delicacy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl's fists clenched even tighter, her eyes blazing, but she
          remained silent, her jaw set in unyielding defiance.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Inquisitor's smile grew colder, his voice lowering to a cruel
          whisper. "But you are so weak… so powerless. You cannot do anything."
          He allowed the words to hang in the air, each one slicing into her
          like a blade. "Since you seem to hate this so much, let's have you
          watch every execution. Wouldn't that be fitting?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned to a demon merchant standing nearby, his tone icy and
          commanding. "Make sure she watches every single one of them."
        </p>
        <p>
          The merchant nodded eagerly, a twisted grin spreading across his face
          as he beckoned two demons to seize her. They moved forward, each
          grabbing one of her arms, yanking her to the ground and forcing her
          head to face the execution platform. She struggled against their hold,
          her teeth gritted, her face contorted with rage and frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ugh!" she groaned, her voice strained as the demons' claws dug into
          her arms, keeping her firmly in place, a trace of blood leaking from
          the sharp claws digging into her soft skin yet she didn't shed a tear
          and endured the pain.
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't look away; her head was locked toward the blood-stained
          platform, her line of sight fixed on the butcher demon's grisly work,
          no matter how hard she tried to avert her gaze. Her heart pounded with
          helpless fury, and the Inquisitor's chilling laugh echoed in her ears
          as he leaned back, watching her futile struggle with unfeigned
          delight.

        <h2>Chapter 240 &nbsp;A surprise gift for demons!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 240</p>
        <p>
          The next slave was dragged forward, and as the butcher demon's knife
          glinted in the torchlight, the Inquisitor leaned forward slightly,
          just enough to ensure the girl could see his eyes. "Pay attention,
          little one," he whispered, his voice as smooth and chilling as ice,
          "because this is only the beginning."
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled slowly, his gaze piercing through the crowd, feeding on the
          fear that had locked their tongues. "Then bring me the next one," he
          said softly, but his voice echoed across the square, slicing through
          their hearts. The butcher demon dragged a sobbing boy forward, a child
          barely in his teens, whose wide, terror-stricken eyes darted around,
          pleading for someone, anyone, to intervene.
        </p>
        <p>
          The laughter of the demons reached a fever pitch as they took in the
          child's small, shaking frame. Some even mocked him openly. "Oh, poor
          thing, will he even scream loud enough?" one jeered, while another
          demon called, "Better practice begging, little one. Maybe they'll let
          you go!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The child's screams as he was pushed to his knees were muffled by the
          din of laughter. His small hands shook as he lifted them in a futile
          attempt to shield himself from the butcher demon's blade.
        </p>
        <p>
          His cries mingled with the steady chant of the demons as they cheered
          for more blood, their voices blending into a horrifying symphony of
          cruelty.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Dispose of him," Vasoth said lazily to the butcher demon. The crowd
          of slaves recoiled, the small moment of hope slipping away as quickly
          as it had appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          The boy was shoved to his knees, his face dull and ghastly, and he
          looked directly at the blade with an expression that embodied fear
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The little girl shook slightly in anger, her strained eyes not wanting
          to watch her own kin being executed at a demon's whim. Yet, she felt
          restrained and could only watch amidst the mocking laughter filling
          her ears.
        </p>
        <p>
          She gritted her teeth as she watched the butcher prepare the sharp,
          long tool while restraining the boy on the execution device.
        </p>

        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          The butcher demon raised his axe, ready to strike the screaming boy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to close her eyes, but each time she tried, the merchant
          would yank her hair with force.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as the butcher was about to behead the boy, a loud sound echoed
          across the surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>It was a booming sound.</p>
        <p>
          Vasoth abruptly turned his head to the west, and as he did, he saw a
          shadowy object flying towards him at terrifying speed.
        </p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          Vasoth stretched his palm forward, and a translucent gray barrier
          appeared, covering him. The shadowy object collided with the barrier
          and fell to the ground before him.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the demons and slaves alike, stunned by the sudden interruption,
          turned their heads towards the object that had struck Vasoth's
          barrier.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth looked down, his pupils dilating as he recognized the 'thing'
          lying at his feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Drul…" he whispered in an eerie voice as he observed the bloody
          corpse of his comrade.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a sight that left him speechless—a twisted, brutal mockery of
          his former ally.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was the lifeless body of the Inquisitor Drul, the red-haired brutal
          demon from before.
        </p>
        <p>The condition of the corpse was beyond imagination.</p>
        <p>The body was missing limbs, with visible holes in various parts.</p>
        <p>
          Both his yellow, sandy eyes were gouged out and missing, as if someone
          had forcefully extracted them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most noticeable feature was the corpse's chest, where a gaping
          hole was visible—a void where his heart should have been, allowing
          anyone to see the ground through the empty cavity.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear that Drul had been tortured and brutally killed; there
          was no doubt. The sinister removal of the eyes and heart sent chills
          through the hearts of those close to Vasoth, who looked at Drul's
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          A hush fell over the crowd as they absorbed the horror of what lay
          before them. Even the most hardened demons felt a prickle of fear run
          down their spines.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth wore a serious expression, the atmosphere around him dark and
          eerie.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a scenario he had never anticipated. Drul, his companion who
          had come to the city with him, now lay dead before his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth knew better than anyone present how powerful Drul had been.
          Even he was unsure he could defeat Drul one-sidedly, much less leave
          him in such a state.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced once more at the tattered body of the demon inquisitor and
          felt a deep sense of unease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul belonged to a prestigious family of demons known for their
          berserk and violent nature—a bloodline feared throughout the demon
          lands. He was physically superior to most demons of his level, thanks
          to his excellent inherited genes.
        </p>

        <p>
          He possessed multiple abilities and had a high affinity with the sand
          element. Cornering him would not have been easy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he also had a special trump card. Yet, despite all
          this, Drul had died so miserably—a troubling sign.
        </p>
        <p>This meant the enemy had completely overpowered Drul.</p>
        <p>
          How one-sided it must have been… Drul's unique eyes should have bought
          him time to distract the enemy and escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those eyes were an inheritance from his forefathers, and even against
          higher-level demons, they should have worked for a moment or two,
          giving Drul enough time to use his artifacts to flee.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the result was before him—his eyes gouged out. The enemy must have
          taken them. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          "Such arrogance…" Vasoth muttered under his breath, his jaw clenched.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hahaha…" Vasoth's features distorted as an ugly expression twisted
          his beautiful face, a shiver running through him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fact that Drul's body had been thrown at him must have been
          intentional.
        </p>
        <p>What was the human intruder trying to convey?</p>
        <p>
          Vasoth turned and glanced at the confused, fearful slaves, his gaze
          becoming subtle and a bit colder.
        </p>
        <p>
          He understood the message. Leave the slaves, or he would meet a
          similar fate.
        </p>
        <p>However…</p>
        <p>The human was clearly underestimating them.</p>
        <p>A cruel smile spread across his face.</p>
        <p>
          Trying to threaten him in his own domain? What a fool. Vasoth would
          make sure he regretted it.
