        <h2>Chapter 131: Elemental Chambers! Chamber of Fire!</h2>

        <p>
          "Now that you all have managed to awaken your elements, it is time to
          start for real."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The first phase of your training will focus on your elements. This
          will be to improve your elemental mastery over your awakened element."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison got up from the chair she was sitting on and said, "Follow me."
        </p>
        <p>
          The children followed her as she led them outside the huge house,
          heading towards a small stone platform.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver noticed a huge array carved on the ground with many complex
          runic symbols drawn on its surface.
        </p>
        <p>Just looking at those symbols made his mind blurred.</p>
        <p>
          "Get on the array, we are moving to our first location," Alison said
          in a plain tone as everyone gathered inside the array.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison moved her hand in a strange gesture before a gentle light
          enveloped all of them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt his head shaking and a sudden urge to vomit. Everything
          looked blurry, and his head felt nauseous.
        </p>
        <p>"Ugh-!"</p>

        <p>He heard Daniel almost puke but in the end, controlled himself.</p>
        <p>
          All of them showed unpleasant expressions as they stabilized
          themselves by sitting down.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oops! Is this your first time using a space transportation array? It
          is normal to feel dizzy initially. Don't worry, it's nothing serious.
          You will be fine in a minute or so."
        </p>
        <p>
          She had expected them to be used to such space arrays given their clan
          background and lineage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, after they settled down, they saw they were in an
          entirely different place. The crisp mountain air filled their lungs,
          carrying a faint scent of pine and earth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In front of them were multiple cuboidal-shaped buildings—or more like
          chambers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison's voice sounded out as she explained, "These are elemental
          houses, and each chamber here is designed to target one particular
          element. For all of you with your elements, you will be training
          inside these."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Woah!" Amber's eyes sparkled as she looked at the structure in front
          of her. Being someone who was raised in the presence of all sorts of
          tools, she was very familiar with these things.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had heard of their existence but had never seen them personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          These elemental houses were specially prepared places where a specific
          environment was artificially created through the use of various
          high-end tools, runic symbols, and complex arrays.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main purpose of these elemental houses was to gain mastery over
          the element associated with your espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it has been evident since ancient times that the best way to
          quickly improve your elemental mastery and attribute was to be in a
          place rich in that attribute.
        </p>

        <p>
          Suppose you have the fire element and want to improve your control
          over it and increase the potency of the element. The best place for
          you would be a location rich in fire element.
        </p>
        <p>A place rich in fire-attributed espera.</p>
        <p>
          Such places could typically be found in areas near volcanoes or
          similar environments. However, not everyone could casually go to such
          harsh places as they wished.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, these elemental houses were made to imitate such places, and they
          were quite effective for training.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the amount of resources consumed to keep these elemental
          houses running was quite exorbitant and pricey, so only a select few
          would ever get an opportunity to enter such a place.
        </p>
        <p>
          But here they were, the rich heirs of the five major clans. To them,
          these resources were worth nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I assume you all are aware of what these elemental houses are for?
          Briefly speaking, each one of them has a replicated environment best
          suited for your element, and for the next few days, you will be
          frequenting this place."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison calmly said as she watched them looking at the scene in awe.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elemental houses were constructed at a place on the mountain top.
          There were some trees behind the elemental houses, and beyond them was
          endless white fog, so not much was visible to the naked eye.
        </p>
        <p>However, the scene was still just as enchanting.</p>
        <p>Oliver took a deep breath. The air was slightly cold and fresh.</p>
        <p>He could not wait to enter one of these chambers.</p>

        <p>"Let me give you all a small tour of the elemental houses first."</p>
        <p>
          She told them to follow her as she led them into the first chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This here is the fire-attributed element chamber," she slowly pushed
          apart the heavy metal door.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instantly, a heat wave swept past the whole crowd of children standing
          behind her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She easily entered inside the gate, prompting the others behind her to
          slowly follow.
        </p>
        <p>
          The moment they stepped inside, a blazing hot air assaulted their
          faces instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but close his eyes momentarily. Narrowing his
          eyes, his brows furrowed as he looked at the scenery in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          In front of him was a pond of terrifyingly hot lava, its molten
          surface bubbling and churning with a menacing glow. The ground beneath
          their feet was charred and cracked, blackened coal scattered like the
          remnants of a forgotten inferno. The oppressive heat seemed to pulse
          from the very air around them, making it hard to breathe.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if they were standing on the surface of a volcano at the
          moment. He could feel the heat from the ground through his expensive
          shoes.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was sure that if he stepped inside barefoot, he would burn his
          soles immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but just the normal temperature in the room was very
          hot, and he was already starting to feel uncomfortable just being
          present inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Agh-! It burns my face!" Amber cried out as she ran back to the exit,
          leaving the room at once.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tsk, tsk, she can't even handle this level of heat. Well, it should
          be expected given her endurance," Alison shook her head as she said
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso heaved a heavy sigh, wiping off the sweat that streamed down
          his face like a river. Each breath felt like inhaling fire, his lungs
          protesting against the scorching air. His clothes clung to his skin,
          drenched in sweat, as he desperately tried to find some relief from
          the relentless heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if he was inside a literal volcano. He was relieved that he
          was not the first one to escape the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I—excuse me, but I cannot stand here anymore… my skin is burning…" he
          said after a few more seconds passed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, Alphonso also spoke up. He could not tolerate it either.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 132: Bella's element! The teacher's shock!</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 132</h2>
        <p>
          "I—excuse me, but I cannot stand here anymore… my skin is burning…"
          Alphonso said after a few more seconds passed by. He couldn't shake
          off the burning sensation on his skin. He glanced at the others,
          seeking reassurance, but found only shared discomfort etched on their
          faces.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, Alphonso also spoke up.</p>
        <p>
          "Hahaha, well, we are all leaving now," Alison said as she glanced at
          the faces of the others. She could see Daniel and Evelyn having a
          tough time as well.
        </p>
        <p>"It looks like you all are too weak to be here."</p>
        <p>
          Hearing her words, they couldn't help but lower their heads in
          embarrassment. After all, it was true that they were really having a
          tough time just being at the entrance of the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          The oppressive heat of the chamber seemed to be getting heavier with
          each second, beads of sweat forming on their brows and trickling down,
          leaving dark patches on their clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if they were asked to go deeper? They really had no endurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You all don't need to make such faces. It's natural that you would
          feel such difficulty being in an environment that does not align with
          your element. But still, I want you all to at least be able to hold
          your ground even if the situation is not in your favor in the future.
          This is just the beginning, and most people are like this initially."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison said in a soft voice as she asked them to leave one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Remember, true strength isn't just about thriving in comfort—it's
          about enduring through the challenges," she added, her voice firm yet
          encouraging.
        </p>
        <p>She did notice one thing, however…</p>
        <p>
          And that was Oliver's resistance. She could see all the other children
          were drenched in sweat and had terrible expressions.
        </p>
        <p>But he…</p>
        <p>
          He remained unbothered… she could not see a drop of sweat on him
          amidst the furnace-like heat, his eyes steady and breaths even,
          contrasting starkly with the others' evident struggles.
        </p>

        <p>'Is he more resistant to the fire element? What's his element?'</p>
        <p>
          She wondered this as she looked at the others. Even Nadia had a frown
          on her face while leaving; she had awakened the ice element, so
          naturally, she was in a place polar opposite to her inherent
          attribute. She was at a natural disadvantage there.
        </p>
        <p>
          She decided to ask them their elements once they were out. If her
          guess was correct, then Oliver might have an element close to the fire
          element or aligning with the fire element family branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          How could she know that after obtaining a special physique, his body
          constitution had changed a lot?
        </p>
        <p>
          With the [Eternal Winter Physique], even in disadvantageous
          surroundings, he would still be resistant to a very high degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          His natural body temperature alone was now way lower than a normal
          human would have in the first place. So normal heat had little to no
          effect on his naturally cold body now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Eternal Winter Physique] not only protected him but seemed to
          exude a faint aura of frost, subtly cooling the air around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          While an individual with an ice element might suffer, someone like
          him, whose entire body constitution was based on evolved ice,
          naturally would not be at a serious disadvantage in such a place.
        </p>
        <p>
          After exiting the fire element chamber, Alison swiftly closed the
          heavy metal door with a bam.
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned around and couldn't help but question, "Right, I forgot to
          ask, but what are your elements?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes scanned the group with keen interest, awaiting their
          responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          She eyed Oliver, Bella, Daniel, and Evelyn when she asked this
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have the Thunder element," Daniel spoke up first, seemingly proud
          of his attribute nature. The Thunder element was a branch variant of
          the common element and was extremely potent.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, you have inherited your clan's signature element. Not bad."</p>
        <p>
          Alison had a hint of surprise. The Thunder element was not common and
          was quite rare in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals with the Thunder element had a lot of potential, given
          that it provided both speed and attack power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the Sacred Sword Clan's main family had many
          thunder-attributed individuals. Many of their sword techniques and
          exorcism techniques were based on the Thunder element as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each technique of their clan was quite destructive in nature, and on
          the battlefield, they always made the demons regret being their
          opponents.
        </p>
        <p>It was an impressive element overall.</p>
        <p>
          "I have the Light element, teacher," Evelyn spoke up next, her eyes
          shining with a strange glint.
        </p>
        <p>
          With her golden shiny hair and deep red eyes, she already had a holy
          look, but coupled with her Light element, she could easily be termed a
          saint.
        </p>
        <p>Her appearance and her element really matched each other.</p>
        <p>
          "A Light element? That's very rare," Alison commented, again
          surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Light element was one of the rarest elements, and not only that,
          it was the most effective element against demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a small attack from the Light element could easily obliterate a
          demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcism techniques based on the Light element were the absolute
          weapon against any demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was noted in textbooks that ancient exorcists with Light elements
          were one of the major reasons that humanity was able to stand against
          demons in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as you awakened the Light element, you were guaranteed a
          special spot in any place in human territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the major clans and top organizations would pay attention to an
          individual with the Light element and nurture them with plenty of
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison was genuinely surprised that someone from the Celestial Paradox
          Clan's main family lineage was able to awaken the Light element.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could be said that with their potent bloodline and Light element,
          Evelyn was destined to become a powerhouse in the future. She was a
          valuable asset to humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes couldn't help but shine. She was going to make sure that
          Evelyn would be able to utilize her element to the best of her
          capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was feeling excited after a long time seeing so much potential…
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella was next as she said in a calm voice, "Teacher, I have magnetism
          as my awakened element."
        </p>

        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          Alison felt numb for some reason. The Light element was already so
          rare, but magnetism…
        </p>
        <p>
          That element was very rare. She had hardly ever heard of individuals
          awakening magnetism as their element, even in her long life of
          hundreds of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could count people with magnetism as their primary element on one
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>But one thing that was common among them all was…</p>
        <p>They were all powerhouses in their own league!</p>
        <p>
          She felt a little complicated inside. Both these sisters had immense
          potential, and she was the one to nurture them to enter the vast world
          out there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought of training someone with such a unique element sent a
          thrill of challenge through her seasoned veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the element magnetism, she did not think that there was an
          elemental chamber dedicated to that element in these elemental houses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The element was extremely rare—even more so than some known rare
          elements like light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals awakening such elements were one in million, so making an
          elemental chamber that consumed so much resources for such a small
          percentage was not very feasible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus it was not even guaranteed that if they prepared such a chamber,
          it will ever be used in the future. Who knows that a person with
          magnetism as the element would ever come under them or not?
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, that was not the only factor, if one were to ignore this in
          favor of their potential and the future of such individuals for
          humanity, the main issue was the mystery surrounding the magnetism
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only was it not researched in depth, there were many complexities
          revolving its true nature, power and method of training.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcists dedicated to such researches were still not able to
          comprehend the element of magnetism in as much depth as other elements
          so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          First of all, finding individuals with magnetism as their element was
          already very hard, not to mention, convincing them to agree to take
          part in research was another chore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most of the people would not allow others to research on them or their
          body—especially when it might cost them their lives too.
        </p>
        <p>
          So Alison's worry was justified, she would need to delve deeper into
          this matter and prepare conditions suitable for Bella to train her
          magnetism element in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, she could do much more before that. While finding exorcism
          techniques and setting up a proper environment for magnetism might be
          complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, she could still train Bella in the basic way, all elements
          followed the similar technique in the beginning stages.
        </p>
        <p>
          Magnetism was a hybrid element and a very mysterious and powerful one
          at that, control over electromagnetism, radio waves and even light to
          some extent. This was just the gist of mastering magnetism. Not to
          mention the control over metals it provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only until later that the elements start to have much higher
          requirements for these.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 132: Bella's element! The teacher's shock!</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 132</h2>
        <p>
          "I—excuse me, but I cannot stand here anymore… my skin is burning…"
          Alphonso said after a few more seconds passed by. He couldn't shake
          off the burning sensation on his skin. He glanced at the others,
          seeking reassurance, but found only shared discomfort etched on their
          faces.
        </p>
        <p>In the end, Alphonso also spoke up.</p>
        <p>
          "Hahaha, well, we are all leaving now," Alison said as she glanced at
          the faces of the others. She could see Daniel and Evelyn having a
          tough time as well.
        </p>
        <p>"It looks like you all are too weak to be here."</p>
        <p>
          Hearing her words, they couldn't help but lower their heads in
          embarrassment. After all, it was true that they were really having a
          tough time just being at the entrance of the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          The oppressive heat of the chamber seemed to be getting heavier with
          each second, beads of sweat forming on their brows and trickling down,
          leaving dark patches on their clothes.
        </p>
        <p>
          What if they were asked to go deeper? They really had no endurance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You all don't need to make such faces. It's natural that you would
          feel such difficulty being in an environment that does not align with
          your element. But still, I want you all to at least be able to hold
          your ground even if the situation is not in your favor in the future.
          This is just the beginning, and most people are like this initially."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison said in a soft voice as she asked them to leave one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Remember, true strength isn't just about thriving in comfort—it's
          about enduring through the challenges," she added, her voice firm yet
          encouraging.
        </p>
        <p>She did notice one thing, however…</p>
        <p>
          And that was Oliver's resistance. She could see all the other children
          were drenched in sweat and had terrible expressions.
        </p>
        <p>But he…</p>
        <p>
          He remained unbothered… she could not see a drop of sweat on him
          amidst the furnace-like heat, his eyes steady and breaths even,
          contrasting starkly with the others' evident struggles.
        </p>

        <p>'Is he more resistant to the fire element? What's his element?'</p>
        <p>
          She wondered this as she looked at the others. Even Nadia had a frown
          on her face while leaving; she had awakened the ice element, so
          naturally, she was in a place polar opposite to her inherent
          attribute. She was at a natural disadvantage there.
        </p>
        <p>
          She decided to ask them their elements once they were out. If her
          guess was correct, then Oliver might have an element close to the fire
          element or aligning with the fire element family branch.
        </p>
        <p>
          How could she know that after obtaining a special physique, his body
          constitution had changed a lot?
        </p>
        <p>
          With the [Eternal Winter Physique], even in disadvantageous
          surroundings, he would still be resistant to a very high degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          His natural body temperature alone was now way lower than a normal
          human would have in the first place. So normal heat had little to no
          effect on his naturally cold body now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Eternal Winter Physique] not only protected him but seemed to
          exude a faint aura of frost, subtly cooling the air around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          While an individual with an ice element might suffer, someone like
          him, whose entire body constitution was based on evolved ice,
          naturally would not be at a serious disadvantage in such a place.
        </p>
        <p>
          After exiting the fire element chamber, Alison swiftly closed the
          heavy metal door with a bam.
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned around and couldn't help but question, "Right, I forgot to
          ask, but what are your elements?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes scanned the group with keen interest, awaiting their
          responses.
        </p>
        <p>
          She eyed Oliver, Bella, Daniel, and Evelyn when she asked this
          question.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have the Thunder element," Daniel spoke up first, seemingly proud
          of his attribute nature. The Thunder element was a branch variant of
          the common element and was extremely potent.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, you have inherited your clan's signature element. Not bad."</p>
        <p>
          Alison had a hint of surprise. The Thunder element was not common and
          was quite rare in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals with the Thunder element had a lot of potential, given
          that it provided both speed and attack power.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the Sacred Sword Clan's main family had many
          thunder-attributed individuals. Many of their sword techniques and
          exorcism techniques were based on the Thunder element as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Each technique of their clan was quite destructive in nature, and on
          the battlefield, they always made the demons regret being their
          opponents.
        </p>
        <p>It was an impressive element overall.</p>
        <p>
          "I have the Light element, teacher," Evelyn spoke up next, her eyes
          shining with a strange glint.
        </p>
        <p>
          With her golden shiny hair and deep red eyes, she already had a holy
          look, but coupled with her Light element, she could easily be termed a
          saint.
        </p>
        <p>Her appearance and her element really matched each other.</p>
        <p>
          "A Light element? That's very rare," Alison commented, again
          surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Light element was one of the rarest elements, and not only that,
          it was the most effective element against demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just a small attack from the Light element could easily obliterate a
          demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcism techniques based on the Light element were the absolute
          weapon against any demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was noted in textbooks that ancient exorcists with Light elements
          were one of the major reasons that humanity was able to stand against
          demons in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as you awakened the Light element, you were guaranteed a
          special spot in any place in human territory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even the major clans and top organizations would pay attention to an
          individual with the Light element and nurture them with plenty of
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison was genuinely surprised that someone from the Celestial Paradox
          Clan's main family lineage was able to awaken the Light element.
        </p>
        <p>
          It could be said that with their potent bloodline and Light element,
          Evelyn was destined to become a powerhouse in the future. She was a
          valuable asset to humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes couldn't help but shine. She was going to make sure that
          Evelyn would be able to utilize her element to the best of her
          capability.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was feeling excited after a long time seeing so much potential…
        </p>
        <p>
          Bella was next as she said in a calm voice, "Teacher, I have magnetism
          as my awakened element."
        </p>

        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          Alison felt numb for some reason. The Light element was already so
          rare, but magnetism…
        </p>
        <p>
          That element was very rare. She had hardly ever heard of individuals
          awakening magnetism as their element, even in her long life of
          hundreds of years.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could count people with magnetism as their primary element on one
          hand.
        </p>
        <p>But one thing that was common among them all was…</p>
        <p>They were all powerhouses in their own league!</p>
        <p>
          She felt a little complicated inside. Both these sisters had immense
          potential, and she was the one to nurture them to enter the vast world
          out there.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought of training someone with such a unique element sent a
          thrill of challenge through her seasoned veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the element magnetism, she did not think that there was an
          elemental chamber dedicated to that element in these elemental houses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The element was extremely rare—even more so than some known rare
          elements like light.
        </p>
        <p>
          Individuals awakening such elements were one in million, so making an
          elemental chamber that consumed so much resources for such a small
          percentage was not very feasible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus it was not even guaranteed that if they prepared such a chamber,
          it will ever be used in the future. Who knows that a person with
          magnetism as the element would ever come under them or not?
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, that was not the only factor, if one were to ignore this in
          favor of their potential and the future of such individuals for
          humanity, the main issue was the mystery surrounding the magnetism
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only was it not researched in depth, there were many complexities
          revolving its true nature, power and method of training.

        <p>

          comprehend the element of magnetism in as much depth as other elements
          so far.

          already very hard, not to mention, convincing them to agree to take

          body—especially when it might cost them their lives too.

          So Alison's worry was justified, she would need to delve deeper into
          this matter and prepare conditions suitable for Bella to train her
          magnetism element in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, she could do much more before that. While finding exorcism
          techniques and setting up a proper environment for magnetism might be
          complex.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, she could still train Bella in the basic way, all elements

          mention the control over metals it provided.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only until later that the elements start to have much higher
          requirements for these.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 134: Water Chamber! Fill the cup?</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 134</h2>
        <p>Snap! BANG!!</p>
        <p>
          As soon as Alison opened the thick chamber door, a roaring sound of
          lightning rang in their ears. The sound was thunderous and
          terrifyingly loud. The group instinctively flinched at the intensity.
        </p>
        <p>
          As soon as the environment came into view of the group, they saw a
          dark stormy sky with black clouds covering the entirety of the sky.
          The air felt charged, almost as if the storm itself was alive and
          pulsating with energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Constant lightning coursed through those thick clouds, occasionally
          raining down on the ground. Each bolt seemed to crackle with a life of
          its own, splitting the darkness with blinding light.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the distance, there were metal rods rooted into the ground and
          conductive surfaces spread like sheets in various areas. They covered
          the floor like patches, and electric current was constantly rampaging
          through those sheets. The ground itself seemed to tremble with each
          flash of lightning, proving to the raw power within the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wind was stormy under those dark clouds, and everything was just
          very destructive in the chamber in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          'This… is not a torture chamber, right?' Oliver paused as he glanced
          at Daniel, who was dazedly looking at the thunder in the sky. His eyes
          held a hint of pity when he thought about the little boy that was
          going to be electrocuted very soon.
        </p>
        <p>"Well then, let's move on to the last chamber."</p>
        <p>
          Alison's calm voice sounded amidst the roaring thunder as she led them
          out. Daniel remained back inside the chamber—too excited to care about
          other things anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison did issue him a strict warning as well, to not venture deep
          into the chamber early on or he would suffer severe consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was finally the last chamber that Alison was going to show them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This here is the chamber of the Light element. It was made after
          extensive research on the element and it consumes way more resources
          than any other chamber so far," she briefly introduced the chamber and
          its history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her voice held a note of pride as she spoke, indicating the
          significance of this particular chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          The history was simple: humanity had always considered individuals
          with the Light element to be divine missionaries sent from the heavens
          to aid them in their war against demonic beings and entities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light was seen as a symbol of hope and purity, a beacon in the
          darkness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Exorcists did not believe in such superstitious rumors, but there were
          many organizations and clans dedicated to worshiping Light element
          users as their holy beings or messengers of heaven.
        </p>
        <p>
          These groups would go to great lengths to protect and venerate those
          with the Light element, often forming entire communities around their
          presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were so-called fanatics, all controlled by a single big
          organization in the novel, which was revealed much later. This
          organization operated from the shadows, pulling strings and
          manipulating events to maintain their power and influence over the
          centuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even he as the reader did not have much information about that part;
          he was not able to read the novel to that extent, so he was just as
          clueless as others.
        </p>
        <p>
          But he knew that the organization behind it was just as powerful as
          the Black Codex Federation or even more so…
        </p>
        <p>
          These elemental chambers were specially requested to be added by such
          people, donating their research and resources to nurture individuals
          with the Light element.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          Alison opened the metallic door to the chamber and instantly a bright
          light enveloped the field of vision of the group.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          Narrowing his eyes, Oliver observed the interior of the chamber of
          Light.
        </p>
        <p>It was a bright, open space with varying light intensities.</p>
        <p>
          The room was filled with bright light of varying intensities,
          illuminating every corner of the room. There was not an inch of
          darkness anywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were multiple reflective surfaces like mirrors and crystals
          etched all around the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group was able to see their reflections at almost all the places
          instantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the distance, there were pillars emitting beams of light and
          rainbows.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was an unmistakable warmth in the room, and the group was able
          to relax under such warmth.
        </p>
        <p>It was a calm place with a bright atmosphere.</p>
        <p>
          If he was not mistaken, those lights emerging from the pillars were
          not ordinary by any means. He could sense a huge amount of espera
          concentrated over those tip points.
        </p>

        <p>
          He dared not use [Cosmic Void Gaze] or he was sure he would be flashed
          right in the eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be akin to seeing the sun directly with the naked eye on a
          bright sunny day.
        </p>
        <p>He refrained from doing something that reckless.</p>
        <p>"This place looks amazingly mystical!"</p>
        <p>
          The group was in awe of the chamber of Light; it was really beautiful
          after all. Evelyn could not help but feel a little special inside to
          have awakened the Light element and how all the others in the group
          were amazed by this.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well then, that's that for you lot. Now get to the chambers of your
          respective elements. I will visit you one by one and impart techniques
          and manipulation of your element."
        </p>
        <p>"Yes, teacher!"</p>
        <p>
          Slowly, they started to leave for their respective chambers one after
          the other.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Umm…" Bella suddenly interrupted Alison as she said, "What about me,
          teacher…?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She sounded hesitant as all her friends were assigned to chambers of
          their elements, but she was not.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had some inkling as to why that was. Her family had constantly
          emphasized and praised how rare magnetism as an awakened element was.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, she still felt a little uncomfortable inside being
          isolated like this while others had something to do and train.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm? Don't worry, girl. We are going to train in a different way."
          Alison patted her head and asked her to wait outside for a while.
        </p>
        <p>"Now then, I should get moving too."</p>
        <p>___________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver approached the entrance of the Water Chamber, a shiver of
          anticipation running down his spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The metallic-looking door, made of smooth, translucent blue crystal,
          shimmered with a soft light, refracting into a spectrum of colors.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking a deep breath, Oliver pressed his hand against the door, which
          swung open with a gentle whispering sound. The moment he stepped
          inside, he felt a sense of tranquility wash over him.
        </p>

        <p>
          The chamber was illuminated by a bright light from the bioluminescent
          plants and algae lining the walls and the lake. The soft glow created
          an ethereal atmosphere, making the chamber feel like a hidden oasis.
        </p>
        <p>
          He heard the gentle splashing of waterfalls, the soft patter of
          droplets, and the distant echo of the strong water current. To him,
          this was not bothersome at all—more so, it sounded like a peaceful
          melody.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp;It was as if the water was singing a calming lullaby, inviting
          him to connect with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air was filled with the fresh scent of rain, mixed with the earthy
          aroma of moss and wet stone. There was also a faint, pleasant smell of
          aquatic plants and flowers blooming along the water's edge.
        </p>
        <p>The combination of scents was refreshing and invigorating.</p>
        <p>
          He did not wait long before the door behind him opened once more as
          Alison entered the chamber too.
        </p>
        <p>
          She handed him a small, florid cup made of polished stone and pointed
          to a distant pedestal in the center of the lake, where a single water
          lily floated.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your first task is to fill this cup with water from the lake without
          touching the water physically," she said, her voice as soothing as the
          chamber itself. "You must connect with the element and draw the water
          to you if you want to fill this, literally."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver paused as he looked towards the area where she had pointed…
        </p>
        <p>
          The distance was quite large. The water lily was directly in the
          middle of the lake, and he had to draw water from that distance to
          fill his cup.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could control water nearby with some ease, but he had never tried
          to move water over larger distances than his arm's length ever.
        </p>
        <p>This was going to be his first time.</p>
        <p>
          Holding the cup in front of him, he closed his eyes and tried to feel
          the water's presence. He visualized the water rising and filling the
          cup, but when he opened his eyes, the water remained still.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not surprising, considering he was about 10 meters, around as much as
          the size of a city bus, away from the lake.
        </p>
        <p>
          He attempted again, this time using more espera to control the water
          to obey him and fall into the cup. He focused on the sensation of the
          water, trying to pull it towards him like a string.
        </p>
        <p>It did not work again.</p>
        <p>
          He tried again, this time, just trying to effectively push the water
          at the lake's edge and create some disturbances towards him and then
          draw out water. He envisioned small ripples forming and moving towards
          him.
        </p>
        <p>But again, this method also did not work.</p>
        <p>
          He kept attempting and trying different methods that came to his mind,
          trying to create all sorts of disturbances in the water, waves, or
          anything to pull out the water from the lake.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>He only got more determined to succeed with each try.</p>
        <p>
          He did not lack espera and used all the espera without constraint. He
          experimented as much as he wanted without getting tired.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was non-stop and kept trying, but the end output was not
          satisfactory and lacking. Despite his efforts, the water remained
          stubbornly out of reach.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          'It's really testing my patience...' he thought with a forced smile as
          he pointed his hand towards the water lily once more.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 135: Training elements!</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 135</h2>
        <p>
          'It's really testing my patience…' he thought with a forced smile as
          he pointed his hand toward the water lily once more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The water in the lake remained stubbornly still, defying his attempts
          to draw it toward him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frustration simmered within him—how could he have so much espera and
          still fail to control the water? He tightened his focus, trying to
          force the water to obey, but it only seemed to resist more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was his technique the problem then? He could not feel that it was the
          case, he had been doing as per the instructions and his
          instincts.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          If the technique was really the problem then he would not have been
          able to even cause the slightest changes or fluctuations in the water
          in the first place much less move anything.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But since that was not the case then he was sure it was not that the
          technique he was using to be changed.
        </p>
        <p>He'd been at this task for what felt like hours, with no success.</p>
        <p>
          The more he focused on trying to force the water to move, the less
          responsive it seemed.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Hmm...' he pondered. Was the approach correct? Should he try
          something different?
        </p>
        <p>A devious idea came to his mind at the moment...</p>
        <p>
          'Should I just go and fill the cup with water from the lake?'&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          But in the next moment, he laughed it off. This was foolish, Alison
          would definitely not believe till he showed her a practical
          demonstration in front of her own eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, it was also his loss if tried to fool her. In the
          future, he would have to rely on himself only after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been some time since he was busy with this task without any
          outcome. He heard the sound of doors moving and Alison entering.
        </p>

        <p>
          His concentration wavered, and he felt the cool dampness of the
          chamber starting to seep into his bones.
        </p>
        <p>Creak!</p>
        <p>
          The creak of the door broke his concentration, and he glanced up to
          see Alison entering, her calm presence reminded him to take a breath.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison approached him, her eyes looking in the still-empty cup with a
          hint of curiosity. "Show me what you've been doing," she asked gently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded, demonstrating his methods with a practiced but weary
          hand. Alison watched, her brow furrowing slightly, and then she placed
          a gentle hand on his shoulder to stop him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was quite surprised internally, given how many methods he had
          already shown her and used before her coming back. He must have
          consumed a lot of espera and was still able to keep going without a
          break.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Did he drink a potion?' she wondered, as this was the only reasonable
          explanation for his stamina so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're trying to control the water too forcefully," she
          observed.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          "Water is fluid and adaptable. It responds best to harmony and flow.
          Feel its rhythm, become one with its movement. Let it come to you
          naturally. Give your mind some rest and think about what I said."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver sighed, was he really forceful? She might have seen something
          that he had missed. He closed his eyes and focused on the cool,
          tranquil aura around him.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Oliver was alone in the Water Chamber, his friends in the nearby
          chambers were undergoing their own training.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the high plateau Wind Chamber, Alphonso struggled to control the
          powerful gusts of wind. His task was to create a gentle breeze to move
          a feather from one side of the chamber to a specific point located far
          away amidst the raging winds.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, each attempt resulted in either too much force, sending the
          feather flying uncontrollably, or too little, leaving it motionless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison's advice echoed in his mind: "Become one with the wind's
          natural flow. Don't resist it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison had given him the advice to become one with the wind's natural
          flow and not resist it, which he seemed to be doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweat trickled down Alphonso's temple as he tried again, inhaling
          deeply and exhaling with a soft, controlled breath. The feather
          fluttered, then slowly drifted toward its target, carried by a breeze
          as gentle as a sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, Amber was deep in the rocky formations and underground
          tunnels, struggling to shape a small boulder into a smooth sphere. Her
          initial efforts resulted in jagged, uneven shapes, her annoyance
          growing with each failure.
        </p>

        <p>Her efforts seemed to crumble literally.</p>
        <p>
          She was also prohibited from using any tools to aid herself, which
          made her quite annoyed. To her, tools were something akin to a body
          part of hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison had told her to connect with the earth's patience and
          persistence, to mold it with steady hands and a calm mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          She sat down, closing her eyes and placing her hands on the boulder.
          Slowly, she let the earth's steady energy flow through her, her
          movements becoming more deliberate and patient. Gradually, the boulder
          began to take a smoother shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the stormy Thunder Chamber, Daniel's task was to summon a
          controlled bolt of lightning to strike a designated target.
        </p>
        <p>
          His struggles were intense; the lightning often veered off course or
          dissipated too quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes, he would even almost bolt himself. He was overexcited to
          control lightning, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          His excitement often resulted in wild, uncontrolled bursts of energy,
          which resulted in the above outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison had to remind him to harness his emotions, to channel his
          intense energy into focused power rather than letting it scatter.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to her, it was not good to go against their inherent
          personality. Daniel was an aggressive and hot-headed boy—his nature
          was like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          So doing something that went against that nature of his was a waste of
          power, according to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She believed that it was instead better to use those intense emotions
          and energy for something more productive.
        </p>
        <p>That was to convert the intensity into power.</p>
        <p>
          Given that his awakened element was thunder, an already raging and
          turbulent attribute, she felt it was better that he use his
          over-the-top energy and transfer that to his manipulation of his
          element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison had told him to harness his emotions—to channel his intense
          energy into focused power rather than letting it scatter.
        </p>
        <p>And this was the most difficult thing for Daniel.</p>

        <p>
          While it might sound advantageous that he could use his intense energy
          and emotions without restraining himself, to do that, he needed just
          as much focus and concentration.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was required to have a calm mind to be able to achieve that. He had
          to achieve this through concentration, which was contrary to his
          hot-blooded nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          He clenched his fists, feeling the crackling energy within him. With a
          deep breath, he focused, letting his emotions fuel the lightning. A
          bolt shot forth, striking the target dead center, and Daniel grinned,
          his eyes alight with triumph.
        </p>
        <p>"Easy peasy...!"</p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>
          In the glacial cavern in the Ice Chamber, Nadia had to create an
          detailed ice sculpture using her abilities. Her initial attempts were
          crude, with the ice either shattering or forming into unrecognizable
          shapes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison's advice was clear: "Shape the ice with delicate finesse, not
          brute force."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison had taught her the importance of precision and control, to
          shape the ice with delicate finesse rather than brute force, which she
          seemed to be doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, something that separated Nadia from others was her
          persistence and lack of interest in anything other than power and
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was relentless, like an emotionless doll set to work tirelessly
          and infinitely. She would take feedback from her mentor and
          incorporate the teachings into her technique seamlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would fail, take input, repeat, and keep training, using ice to
          form a finely sculpted structure.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if someone did not tell her to stop, she would keep on going
          until she fainted, so Alison had to ask her to pause in between.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison was particularly impressed with Nadia's tenacity and espera. So
          far, only Oliver and the two sisters had proven to be capable of
          having as much espera as her.
        </p>
        <p>As for the sisters...</p>
        <p>
          In the sunlit Light chamber, Evelyn's task was to manipulate light
          beams to create a specific pattern on a wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her initial attempts resulted in scattered, unfocused light that
          failed to form the desired shapes. Alison guided her to focus her
          inner light, to control its intensity and direction with clarity and
          intent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Evelyn closed her eyes, centering herself. She imagined the pattern
          clearly, feeling the light within her pulse in response. Opening her
          eyes, she directed the beams with absolute control, and the desired
          shape gradually took form on the wall.
        </p>
        <p>_____________________</p>
        <p>
          Alison transported them all back to the dormitory using the array.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the day drew to a close, the group reconvened in the dormitory,
          exhaustion etched on their faces.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Back in the cozy dormitory, Oliver joined his friends as they unwound
          from the day's events. All of them had exhaustion written on their
          faces at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison had promised them a meal, and they gathered around the large
          wooden dining table, anticipation mingling with their fatigue as they
          waited for her.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Haha… then did you know, I used too much force and almost burnt my
          whole arm! The thunder bolts are no joke—very sharp and precise!"
          Daniel exclaimed, his eyes wide with the memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Pfft-! That's it? I was almost about to fall off a steep cliff due to
          the strong wind! Teacher came in the nick of the moment and saved me!
          I was almost dead otherwise!" Alphonso recounted, a shiver running
          through him.
        </p>
        <p>
          They shared stories, laughed about their mishaps, and made fun of
          others. The sense of community and support filled Oliver with some
          warmth. He liked this sort of atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>"Alright! The food is ready, you lot! Let's have a blast!"</p>
        <p>
          A cheerful voice belonging to Alison sounded as she entered the dining
          area with a steel pot in her hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, Oliver had an ominous feeling when he observed the brownish
          fumes wafting from the steel container.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Don't tell me this is one of those scenarios where the teacher would
          force us to eat her trash cooking?'
        </p>
        <p>
          His stomach churned at the sight, and he instinctively took a step
          back, eyes widening in disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          A look of horror flashed past his eyes when Alison put down the
          contained on the table for them to see.
        </p>
        <p>And he was right!</p>
        <p>
          The pot was nothing but a brown mess of something between liquid and
          solid—something unidentifiable entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh? What's this?" Daniel who was sitting a bit far came over
          curiously, The pungent smell hit him, and he recoiled, pinching his
          nose as nausea overtook him.
        </p>
        <p>'What the fuck is this!?'</p>
        <p>
          He instantly pinched his nose with his fingers, closing the entrance
          before he inhaled any more of this smell and puked on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          His face turned green, and he staggered back, desperately trying to
          hold his breath. The stench was overwhelming, invading his senses with
          an intensity that left him dizzy.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the brown content with a disgusted gaze, before his eyes
          wandered to the others sitting on the table and he could see they all
          mirrored a similar expression to his.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Fuck!' Daniel cursed internally, he didn't want to think that way but
          looking at the contents, his mind could not help but wander to that
          direction, as it wandered to the worst possible thought
        </p>
        <p>'Isn't this basically someone's sh*t!?'</p>

        <p>
          His eyes turned into saucers as his brain no longer restrained and
          thought all the worst things imaginable.
        </p>
        <p>"Ueakkh-!"</p>
        <p>Unable to hold it in, Daniel fell to his knees and puked.</p>
        <p>
          The sight of Daniel vomiting on the ground coupled with the smelly
          brown food and foul smell, all those present felt their hunger
          disappear automatically. The scene made their hunger vanish!
        </p>
        <p>
          "What happened to you? Already breaking out on the first day of
          training?" Alison looked at him confused.
        </p>
        <p>
          She seemed to be genuinely clueless why he was behaving in such a way.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Woah! Teacher, it seems he is having a tough time enduring the
          stress, allow me to take him back to his room! He needs immediate
          attention and medical care!" Oliver rushed over, hoping to escape the
          impending meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver walked over hurriedly, ready to take Daniel to his room and
          never return.
        </p>
        <p>However his scheme was cut short when another voice sounded out.</p>
        <p>
          "Wait, let me do it! My room is just next to Daniel, it would be more
          efficient for me to take him back!" Alphonso said in a panicked tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "W-What are you saying!? How is this related to rooms being next to
          each other? I-I will do it, this way I can make up to him for my
          mistake last time!" Amber interjected, also desperate to avoid the
          meal.
        </p>
        <p>Amber jumped in too ready to drag Daniel back with her.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia, Evelyn just watched the drama from sidelines, watching them
          fight among themselves on who would take him to his room.
        </p>
        <p>
          They both also did not want to eat this abomination of a dinner either
          but they could not act like them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stop." Alison said in a loud voice making the trio who were bickering
          among themselves on who would take Daniel back to his room.
        </p>
        <p>"I will do it. You guys in the meantime eat the food."</p>
        <p>Alison stated as she picked up the kneeling Daniel with one hand.</p>
        <p>
          "This isn't too severe; he just needs rest," she muttered to herself.
        </p>

        <p>
          She was thinking if it would be better to directly feed him a health
          potion or not but looking at it, it did not seem to be something too
          severe so she decided to let him rest.
        </p>
        <p>"This…"</p>
        <p>
          Looking at Alison's back, they did not know what to say, they planned
          to take him and then not return back to eat this food but now the plan
          would not work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glancing at the boiling brown food, they all felt a wave of disgust.
        </p>
        <p>"No human should have to eat this…" Amber whispered, worried.</p>
        <p>"What do we do?"</p>
        <p>
          Amber asked in a worried tone as she looked towards the other two.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I really don't want to eat this," Alphonso said, on the verge of
          tears. "I've never eaten anything less than a full-course meal, and
          now this…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso looked like he was about to cry, if it was his clan, then he
          would have simply ordered the cooks to make something else for him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a picky eater and never ate anything less than a full course
          fancy meal in his lifetime and now suddenly being asked to try this
          alchemical creation of their teacher.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was one hundred percent sure that he would never be able to eat
          this thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned his head over to Oliver who was now his only hope out of
          this situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being stared by two pairs of expectant eyes, he felt a little
          helpless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he had to do something or he was sure that he might not
          ever see the sun again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Teacher has gone up to put Daniel back to his room, it should take
          her a minute or two to diagnose him and then return. In the meantime,
          the best I could think of is to destroy this… thing," he gazed at the
          bubbling hot brown-ish food, "we need to get it done before she comes
          back. Dispose of this food."
        </p>
        <p>
          They exchanged hurried glances, a silent agreement forming. The clock
          was ticking, and Alison could return any moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso and Amber looked at him and were ready to follow what he
          spoke.
        </p>
        <p>"Should we throw it outside?" Alphonso suggested with a frown.</p>

        <p>
          "No, are you stupid? Teacher would definitely know if we do that!"
          Amber immediately retorted.
        </p>
        <p>"Then what?" Alphonso asked.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver sighed, "You all have storage artifacts, right? Someone just
          store it inside."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh!"</p>
        <p>
          Their eyes lit up. "Indeed, that's the best way!" Amber said
          excitedly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber excitedly said, if they stowed away this in their storage
          artifacts then there was no way their teacher was ever going to find
          it unless they showed it to her themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Great, absolutely genius! Hurry up, we should do it right now!"
          Alphonso excitedly said to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am not storing that stuff in my artifact," Oliver stated firmly.
          There was no way he was putting that abomination in his space. Either
          Alphonso or Amber had to do it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't want to stain my storage space either." Amber said and pouted
          at him and then looked at Alphonso.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver also looked at him.</p>
        <p>
          "Ugh!" Seeing the two of them corner him so quickly, he didn't have
          any way out.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced around desperately, searching for any possible excuse to
          avoid the task, but found none. Resigned, he let out a heavy sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          He groaned, realizing he had no escape. He glanced at the two silent
          girls at the table, still observing the scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          No! He could not ask two ladies to do it for him! How ungentlemanly
          would that be.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the end, he had no choice but to put the food in his storage space.
        </p>
        <p>'It's going to be a mess inside, how would I clean it.'</p>
        <p>
          He sighed again, contemplating how to store the contents without
          contaminating his entire storage space.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey, you guys, please help me out, I don't want to make a mess inside
          my storage space. You should know that there are potions and pills
          inside, if this toxic liquid touched those things, I would never be
          able to consume them…"
        </p>
        <p>He asked in a bitted tone to the two in front of him.</p>
        <p>
          "Well…" Oliver and Amber exchanged glances, realizing Alphonso had a
          point. Sacrificing his valuable items just to avoid eating the food
          wasn't fair.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could not sacrifice his stuff just for this. Not only would it be
          too selfish on their behalf but also a huge waste of such precious
          resources.
        </p>
        <p>"I have an idea."</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly a voice sounded out, making both Alphonso and Amber startle
          from their deep thoughts as they pondered about what should be done.
        </p>
        <p>
          They turned their heads towards the source of the voice and looked
          with wide eyes.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 137 &nbsp;Let him cook?</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 137</h2>
        <p>
          They looked with widened eyes towards the person who said it out,
          unable to help but feel a little emotional when they saw him speak
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was Oliver who once again had an idea about the situation, he was
          really their go-to problem solver, who once again had an idea.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both of them felt a surge of gratitude that he was present today with
          them, or else they might have seriously offended Alison already.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was the linchpin in their plan to avoid eating the alchemical
          disaster masquerading as dinner. No one wanted to risk their lives
          with that concoction. They needed to dispose of it discreetly, without
          arousing Alison's suspicion or causing a mess in their storage
          artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
          So getting rid of this thing was important for them, and they had to
          do it cleanly so they don't make Alison suspicious of them and their
          activities but also not start a mess in their storage artifacts
          either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time was of the essence. They had to act before their mentor returned
          from settling Daniel upstairs. The two couldn't help but silently
          curse Daniel's luck in avoiding this mess due to his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two could not help but silently curse Daniel about how lucky he
          was to escape this whole situation just because of his condition.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I have an idea." Oliver said as he glanced towards Nadia who met his
          gaze, "however, I would need some help…" n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia met his gaze, a flicker of confusion crossing her otherwise
          emotionless stare.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just hurry up! The teacher would be down any moment now." Amber
          urged.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright, I will use my element and concentrate this food in a cluster
          and then Nadia, could you freeze it for me? This way, Alphonso should
          be able to store it successfully in his storage artifact without
          messing around."
        </p>
        <p>
          When they heard this, all of them had a hint of realization. Indeed,
          that was definitely possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          All three of them turned their heads to the only girl with the ice
          element.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia frowned, but on second thought, if she did not help then…</p>
        <p>
          She glanced at the 'food' and decided to just aid them for the time
          being.
        </p>

        <p>
          Deciding it was better to help than to face the consequences, she
          nodded.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver quickly got to work…</p>
        <p>
          In fact, he could do both these things himself quickly, considering he
          had the control over both water element and ice element. Even though
          he had not trained the ice element much, he was confident in freezing
          some liquid on his own without any external help.
        </p>
        <p>
          But they did not need to know about this, at least not right now. He
          had just awakened his ice element and had not trained at all in that
          element either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, awakening two elements despite being under 10 years of age was
          an inhumane achievement in this world. According to the laws and
          principles of the world, a human would not be able to awaken more than
          a one element after drinking honorable stars' essence—not until their
          bodies fully assimilated the awakened element they primarily had
          awakened.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there were no such restrictions around, what was stopping the major
          clans to drown their heirs in honorable stars' essence since birth and
          let them awaken all elements in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only the human's affinity to a particular element mattered but
          also the how well they would be able to manage the power of more than
          one element inside their bodies.
        </p>
        <p>
          A child's body was considered not strong enough to coordinate two
          elements internally so no matter what, no exorcist was stupid enough
          to do this stunt especially when the child could just die to due to
          imbalance of elements in the body.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone did not have the affinity with a particular element, then
          no matter how many vials of essence they devoured, they would not be
          able to awaken that element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similarly, the stronger the element someone primarily awakens, the
          lesser their chances get to awaken more potent elements in the future,
        </p>
        <p>
          It was believed by the expert exorcists specialized in this field that
          a stronger primary element establishes a hardcore dominance inside the
          body of the individual, and further does not allow other weaker
          elements to exist...
        </p>
        <p>
          Suppose someone managed to awaken a powerful hybrid element like the
          Thunder element that Daniel had awakened, then their chances would be
          lesser as compared to Alphonso, someone who had awakened wind element
          to hope to awaken a second element.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was why that individuals with multiple elements were not common.
          He felt it was better to have some secret cards exclusive to his
          knowledge only.
        </p>

        <p>__________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver got to work, stretching out his hand towards the 'food', he
          closed his eyes and focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rhythm of the water resonated within him as the liquid inside the
          steel contained stirred slowly moving into circles as a small vortex
          formed at the center and in front of everyone's eyes, the liquid
          gathered and concentrated into a liquid ball, it was a brown-colored
          ball of floating liquid.
        </p>
        <p>"Nadia…" he called out to her.</p>

        <p>
          Nadia looked at the spherical ball and her eyes narrowed, his control
          over water element was surprisingly good.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could tell this, she would require a lot of concentration to be
          able to maintain this shape for a long time using liquid ice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, she pointed her finger towards the floating liquid ball
          as frost started covering the liquid, slowly freezing the entire ball
          until it turned into a crystalline ball of brown ice.
        </p>
        <p>"It's done."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver caught the ball in his hand mid-air before it crashed into the
          ground and threw it towards Alphonso who caught it in the end moment
          with some fumbling.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So cold!" Alphonso winced, quickly storing the ball in his ring. He
          looked at Oliver in surprise; the ice was unnaturally cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was weird, the ice was chilling cold, way colder than some normal
          ice yet he was fine and he had such a reaction? Was he that weak
          compared to Oliver?
        </p>
        <p>
          He almost believed that he might have gotten a frostbite had he held
          the ball longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Finally, it's disposed of…" Amber chuckled as she slumped down at her
          chair. She was already very tired and now after this stunt, she did
          not even have the energy to bother around anymore.
        </p>
        <p>Simply too exhausted.</p>
        <p>
          It looked like she would be sleeping empty-stomach, she regretted not
          storing some food supplies before leaving the clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes trailed to Oliver who was wiping his hands with a towel. She
          wondered if he had any arrangements or if he would be sleeping hungry
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before she could ask if he had any food, footsteps echoed from the
          staircase. Alison was coming down.
        </p>
        <p>
          They quickly settled back into their seats as&nbsp;Alison entered
          shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She noticed the empty steel container and raised a brow as she looked
          at the group.
        </p>
        <p>"You guys already finished it?" she questioned.</p>
        <p>
          "Ah! Teacher, it was a decent meal! We were so hungry that we ate it
          all. Hahaha." Amber said politely, laughing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Y-Yes ma'am, sorry for the lack of decorum," Alphonso added in
          support.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Hmm…" Alison hummed and looked at the other three who just remained
          silent.
        </p>
        <p>"Well, it's good that you liked the food." she smiled and said.</p>
        <p>"Now get back to your room and prepare for tomorrow's training."</p>
        <p>With that, she left the room leaving the group in silence.</p>
        <p>Growl… Rumble…</p>
        <p>
          A rumbling noise of stomach sounded in the silence—it was true that
          all of them were hungry.
        </p>
        <p>But now what?</p>
        <p>"Ahem, does anyone know how to cook?" Alphonso questioned.</p>
        <p>
          "My sister does…" Evelyn spoke but Bella was not there at the moment
          so it was not helpful.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you kidding me? How do you expect literal kids like us to know
          how to cook?" Amber frowned, crossing her arms against her chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well… Bella does, but she is not here haha." Alphonso laughed lightly
          but he was really hungry.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver sighed as he looked at the them, "I can cook."</p>
        <p>
          "Really!?" Alphonso's expression changed as his face lit up in
          delight, he stared at Oliver with anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber also stared at him with surprise, she did not expect him of all
          people to be familiar with such a skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can you please make us something?" Alphonso blushed a little, "Sorry,
          if I sound weird…"
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that Oliver was equally tired as them but he could not help
          but ask in hope. He did not want to sleep hungry. He was exceptionally
          courteous when he asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Cook with what? Do you have the ingredients?" Oliver questioned,
          looking at Alphonso as if he were a clown. How did he expect to make
          food without ingredients?
        </p>
        <p>"…Ah!"</p>
        <p>
          This realization instantly hit them hard, washing their dreams with a
          bucket of cold water.
        </p>
        <p>"However…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver let out a smile as he looked at the disappointed group of
          people.
        </p>
        <p>"I do remember storing some food before leaving my clan."</p>
        <p>_______________</p>

        <h2>
          Chapter 138 &nbsp;Getting skilled in using element! Practical training
          begins!
        </h2>
        <h2>Chapter 138</h2>
        <p>"I do remember storing some food before leaving my clan."</p>
        <p>
          It took a moment for the group to let his words sink in. When they
          finally registered what Oliver said, their expressions lit up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso sprang from his chair, excitement written all over his face.
          "You have food with you!? Why didn't you say so earlier!?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber's composure shattered. "Right! Oliver, we've been starving
          here!"
        </p>
        <p>"Hey Oliver, man we…" Alphonso looked at him expectant.</p>
        <p>
          "Of course, I can share some with all of you, but…" Oliver paused,
          glancing at the pack of hungry wolves before him. He continued, "…you
          need to pay."
        </p>
        <p>He rubbed his hands while eyeing them as potential customers.</p>
        <p>"Pay? Pay what?" Evelyn could not help but ask.</p>
        <p>
          "Well, it could be anything… you all must have brought some treasures
          and resources, right? How about sharing some of it?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "What…?" Amber's mouth dropped open. She looked at him in shock.
          Trading simple food for treasures? It was outrageous! This was
          daylight robbery!
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to trade simple food with treasures! How ridiculous was
          that? This was literal robbery!
        </p>
        <p>She didn't think anyone would agree to this idea at all.</p>
        <p>
          She expected everyone to balk at the idea, but reality surprised her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso was the first to speak, his eyes carried a determined
          expression as he said, "Indeed, you are right. I, the heir of Fallen
          Heart Clan, am not shameless enough to just take your supplies without
          any payment."
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at Oliver and added, "How about one vitality-strengthening
          potion? Is that enough for one day's worth of food?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver hadn't expected him to agree so quickly. He was ready for
          resistance and would have given them the food anyway, but their
          willingness to trade stunned him. 'As expected of rich clan heirs,' he
          thought, eyes shining with newfound insight.
        </p>

        <p>
          Indeed these people were the children of richest exorcists, they did
          not lack resources.
        </p>
        <p>They were great customers!</p>
        <p>"Of course!"</p>
        <p>
          "Then, here you go." Alphonso produced a glass bottle containing a
          blue liquid and handed it over to Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Pleasure doing business!" Oliver said, passing some food in return.
        </p>
        <p>"The pleasure is all mine. Then pardon me…"</p>
        <p>
          Alphonso went back to his chair and started eating the food elegantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at him eating and hearing the sounds of eating, the sound of
          him chewing the food made them gulp subconsciously.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will give you one vitality strengthening pill." Evelyn approached
          him and gave him a shiny crystal green pill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver exchanged the supplies, and she joined Alphonso at the table,
          eating quietly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia came up to him and stared into his eyes. He looked back, her
          eyes were serious.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can have it for free—" he started, but she cut him off, producing
          a scroll.
        </p>
        <p>She gave it to him and looked at him with a sharp look.</p>
        <p>"Umm… here." he did not open the scroll but first gave her food.</p>
        <p>
          He was intending to give it to her for free anyways so it did not
          matter what she wanted to trade it with.
        </p>
        <p>He stored the scroll away for later inspection.</p>
        <p>
          Only Amber was left, her expression a mix of difficulty and
          unwillingness. Oliver shrugged. He wasn't going to give her special
          privileges; if everyone else paid, she must too. Anyway, his supplies
          were limited, and it was better for him if she didn't take any.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Well, the food supplies will run out eventually, I should start
          arranging ingredients to cook in the future.'
        </p>

        <p>
          He took out something to eat for himself too—it was a simple plain
          sandwich.
        </p>
        <p>Crunch!</p>
        <p>
          Hearing the crispiness of the sandwich Oliver was eating, Amber's
          mouth watered despite her efforts to control herself. Gritting her
          teeth, in the end, she also offered him a potion and filled her
          stomach with his food supplies.

        <p>
          Days flowed by in a steady rhythm, each one filled with the hum of
          intense training. Oliver stood by the lake, his brow furrowed in
          concentration. He extended his hand over the water, feeling the cool,
          fluid energy beneath his fingers. Gradually, a thin stream of water
          rose, shimmering in the sunlight as it obeyed his will, twisting and
          turning in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a determined expression, he focused, his movements becoming more
          fluid as he manipulated the water to fill a nearby cup. The liquid
          obeyed, splashing gently into the vessel until it was brimming. A
          small smile tugged at Oliver's lips—he was getting the hang of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was becoming adept at using the water element, controlling it with
          increasing ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was able to successfully fill the cup by manipulating the water
          from the lake as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Occasionally, the solitude of the water chamber was broken by the
          arrival of his friends. Daniel would burst in, his eyes sparking with
          energy, eager to share his latest triumph with thunder. "Check this
          out, Oliver! I can summon lightning with just a snap now!" he'd
          exclaim, demonstrating with a crackling burst of electricity.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alphonso, ever composed, would stroll in, exchanging quiet advice and
          solutions. "Try visualizing the water as an extension of yourself," he
          suggested one afternoon, watching as Oliver practiced. "It's all about
          the connection. I am starting to realize it with my wind element too
          slowly, it's a wonderful feeling. "
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the days, their bonds also strengthened, the group was slowly
          knitting together one way or other, either by sharing their experience
          or thinking ways to avoid Alison's cooking.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the evenings, they would gathered in the dormitory after a long day
          of training, their laughter echoing through the halls had become a
          common occurrence.
        </p>
        <p>Time flew by...</p>
        <p>
          He was tasked with various things day after day, One day, he was
          tasked with forming a straight water blade, given that its edge should
          be sharp. He stood by the lake, his hand outstretched, eyes narrowed
          in concentration. The blade wavered at first, but then it solidified,
          glistening with a faint blue glow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another day, he plunged into the depths of the lake, staying submerged
          for as long as possible, the water enveloping him in a serene, silent
          embrace. He focused on his breathing, feeling the water flow through
          his lungs naturally, as if he belonged there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having water element, breathing underwater was quite simple and
          natural to him. He was shocked the first time he tried it.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the toughest challenges came when Alison tasked him to meditate
          beneath a roaring waterfall. The force constantly pounded against his
          shoulders, but he sat with eyes closed, legs crossed, balancing his
          mind amid the chaos.
        </p>

        <p>
          She had told him that it was necessary to nurture a calm mind and
          develop an extraordinary temperament as one should expect from a heir
          of a major clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water was often related to calm, so an individual with water
          attributed espera must be calm when using it. At least that was what
          she believed and taught.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, his muscles screamed in protest, but gradually, he grew
          accustomed to the pressure, his body and mind becoming one with the
          torrent.
        </p>
        <p>
          He found a certain peace in the water, a sense of belonging that grew
          stronger with each passing day. The water chamber slowly turned into
          his sanctuary where he would push himself to limits everyday and
          discover the true depth of his abilities.
        </p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>
          "It's been 2 months now, you kids have made significant progress in
          this time span. I am impressed by you and your potential."
        </p>
        <p>
          Alison was standing before the group of children seated in front of
          her.
        </p>
        <p>Except for Bella.</p>
        <p>
          When they questioned where she was, all they got as a reply was that
          she was training somewhere else due to her element's uniqueness and
          situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then, it's been a long while since you lot have been training
          your elements continuously, so from now on, we will be moving on to a
          practical course of training." she stated.
        </p>
        <p>"Practical course?"</p>
        <p>
          "That's correct, it's time you put your elements to use and not just
          keep on training, it's better for you kids to start gaining experience
          and learn about real combat. The earlier it is, the better!" Alison
          said.
        </p>
        <p>The group listened to her intently.</p>
        <p>"Teacher, how are we going to do that?"</p>
        <p>
          Alison looked at Amber who had asked and said in a light tone, "For
          this, elder Sigfor will be going to help you all."
        </p>
        <p>
          'That geezer?' Daniel frowned. He had unpleasant memories with that
          old man.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mhm. Elder Sigfor, you see has a special element. It's called
          illusion, the element of illusion. And he is the one who will be
          helping you with it."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well then, he will fetch you guys soon, I have something to do so I
          will probably see you all later. Ah, right, Bella will be joining your
          practical training soon."
        </p>
        <p>She said while leaving the bewildered group of children.</p>
        <p>
          "I don't want that old bastard to be the the one teaching us. I
          fucking hate that two-faced snake." Daniel groaned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's very crude and ill-mannered." Alphonso also commented lightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whatever, it's not like you guys can do anything about it." Amber
          scoffed.
        </p>
        <p>"Do what?"</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, an old and hoarse voice sounded behind them, making everyone
          flinch in shock.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 139 &nbsp;The unsettling grip in the elder's heart!</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 139</h2>
        <p>"Do what?"</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, an old and rasping voice sounded behind them, making all of
          them flinch in shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          "W-What!?" Amber spun around, eyes wide, and there stood Sigfor, hands
          clasped behind his back, wearing a simple red robe. "S-Sir Sigfor!
          When did you get behind us!?"
        </p>
        <p>
          All of them looked at him in shock; they did not sense him approaching
          at all.
        </p>
        <p>"I just arrived," he said, his tone flat.</p>
        <p>"Oh..."</p>
        <p>
          Hearing this, all of them heaved a sigh of relief. If Sigfor had
          overheard Daniel, they all knew there would be
          consequences.&nbsp;"Anyways, follow me, I will take you to your new
          training area."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor said as he clicked his tongue and left, with the group
          following behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          They followed him to an array formation. Sigfor activated it, and they
          were transported to a new location.
        </p>
        <p>
          By now, they were accustomed to the teleportation arrays and the odd
          sensations they induced. The initial nausea and disorientation had
          become minor inconveniences, easily brushed off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Be it nausea or something else, they eventually got used to that
          feeling in the end, so it did not bother them as much as it used to in
          the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were once again back to the familiar hall they were in at the
          beginning, meaning they were at the base of the mountain, the very
          bottom where they all started.
        </p>

        <p>"Alright, let's not waste time. We begin now," Sigfor announced.</p>
        <p>"Sir Sigfor, what are we be doing first?" Evelyn asked.</p>
        <p>
          "The first thing I want you to focus on is improving your teamwork. By
          now, you all must be aware that you will be entering the Perpetual
          Plane from your clans. While that place is a land of opportunities, it
          is anything but simple. The dangers there are just as terrifying for
          your level," he paused, allowing the gravity of his words to sink in.
          "Nothing is free—especially treasures and resources. To gain power,
          you must face trials."
        </p>
        <p>A silence enveloped the group as they listened.</p>
        <p>
          "So the most appropriate approach for you lot is to travel in a group
          or team when you enter that place. Not only will it increase your
          chances of survival out there, but you will also have more probability
          of chancing upon great treasures."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Which is why I will help you coordinate with each other and improve
          your teamwork as well. With varying elements, it is going to be
          difficult initially but nothing close to impossible," he told them in
          a calm voice.
        </p>
        <p>"How will that work?" Daniel asked, curiosity in his eyes.</p>
        <p>
          The old man cast him a side glance, remembering the dumb boy from
          before, his antics still the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We will be using some talismans for that," he replied in a light
          tone.
        </p>
        <p>"Talismans?" Daniel looked at him with a puzzled expression.</p>
        <p>
          "Each of you kids will be infusing your elemental espera in these
          talismans, first learning how to control the flow of your espera and
          supply it into a delicate talisman—making sure not to destroy it in
          the process."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The circuit inside the talisman is a complex thing, and learning the
          flow of your espera to control it and guide it inside is necessary to
          maintain its stability if you ever want to use it."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor explained. He snapped his fingers, and a wooden box appeared in
          his hands. Inside were talismans with intricate engravings and runes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were a bunch of talismans with complex engravings and different
          runes etched into them, making them look like a collection.
        </p>
        <p>He put the box down for the group to see.</p>

        <p>
          "Sir Sigfor, these talismans look of great quality," Amber said with
          interest as she looked at the talismans. "If I remember the patterns
          properly, one of them should be for creating barriers, and this one
          here should be for summoning elemental constructs or launching an
          elemental attack."
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing her speak as if she was familiar with the talismans, Oliver
          had a certain light in his eyes. It seemed she was genuinely
          knowledgeable about such things.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could later ask her for references or see if she knew how to make
          them. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>Sigfor's eyes gleamed with approval.</p>
        <p>
          "Good kid, what was your name?" Sigfor had a pleasant expression on
          his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can call me Amber," she said, thinking of something before
          introducing a bit more about her background, "I am from the Blue Crown
          Clan."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No wonder! Now I see why you are aware of this stuff. Your clan is
          unparalleled in this field, hahaha!" Sigfor laughed as he traced a
          hand over his beard. "Still, for a mere kid, you were able to
          recognize the patterns. It's quite impressive, I must say. The clan
          heir is indeed talented."
        </p>
        <p>
          Amber did not say anything and just listened to his rare praise. Her
          lips couldn't help but curl slightly. She secretly cast a glance in
          Oliver's direction only to see him lost in his own thoughts while
          staring at the talismans.
        </p>
        <p>He was completely oblivious to the praise.</p>
        <p>'He is not even listening...' she thought with a frown.</p>
        <p>
          "Damn! This old man actually praised her?" Daniel whispered to
          Alphonso, who nodded solemnly. They both clearly did not expect this
          old man to praise them ever. They were surprised by Sigfor's
          compliment
        </p>
        <p>To them, the old man had a black heart.</p>
        <p>
          "You brats! What are you whispering amongst yourselves! Say it out
          loud if you have something to speak!" Sigfor barked, his eyes sharp as
          he turned his head around to look at the two brats acting weirdly and
          whispering to each other.
        </p>
        <p>Were they ignoring him?</p>
        <p>
          "No, no, Sir Sigfor," Alphonso stammered. "We were just curious about
          how the talismans will help with our teamwork."
        </p>

        <p>
          Sigfor looked at him and shook his head. "It's simple," he said,
          taking out a talisman with a rune etched on its papery surface. "You
          will first learn to control your elemental flow, and once you all have
          achieved some level of control, I will assign you into pairs, two of
          you in one team."
        </p>
        <p>
          He grazed his thumb over the smooth texture of the paper as he looked
          at them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will be dividing your little group into teams of two. The two team
          members would then be tasked with filling the talisman—a blank rune
          talisman designed for elements."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your task will be to combine elements with your teammate and generate
          a combination attack, a mix of the two elements. I will be judging the
          output your team is able to generate in the end according to my
          standards. The more synergy between your team, the better." Sigfor
          paused, "And... the winning team will get a reward too."
        </p>
        <p>
          The group suddenly turned excited. Not only was this incredibly
          interesting to do, but they might also even win a reward if they
          performed well enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Note that this isn't easy. Carelessness can lead to injury. Matching
          your partner's elemental flow is crucial," Sigfor warned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Anyways, for now, work individually. Take a talisman from the box,
          but don't touch the purple ones; they are off-limits for now. After
          taking a talisman, take a seat at a desk behind and start channeling
          your espera into it. If you damage it, then take a new one. Most of
          them are dummy talismans, so feel free to use them."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor said as he summoned a chair from his storage ring and put it in
          front of them, calmly sitting on it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver turned around and saw a bunch of wooden desks and chairs behind
          him. The open hall gave a view of the outside to some extent, so it
          was a refreshing scene in general.
        </p>
        <p>
          He picked a talisman and sat at a desk, gently channeling his
          water-attributed espera into it. The others followed suit, focused on
          their task.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rest of the group followed suit and picked up a talisman for their
          own use.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor carefully observed them. He was able to see who had more
          control over their espera while they filled the talisman with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor watched closely, noting those with exceptional control. 'That
          white-haired kid… His control is frighteningly sharp. And the
          golden-haired girl… Equally impressive.'
        </p>
        <p>He could not help but feel they were too good for their age.</p>
        <p>
          However, his gaze lingered on Oliver. An inexplicable discomfort
          stirred in his heart whenever he looked at the boy
        </p>
        <p>
          His brows furrowed whenever his eyes scanned Oliver. It was not
          because he could not believe that a child his age could have such
          superior control over their espera, but something entirely different.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was just his intuition, an unsettling intuition that he could not
          shake. It was as if his heart was being suffocated by an invisible
          grip that he could not pinpoint even with his sharp senses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he had gotten used to searching or scanning those
          weaker than him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But earlier, when he first met Oliver at the mountain's base, he
          probed him only to be met with a blockage or a strong force messing
          with his senses the moment he tried to probe inside his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was incredulous how he was not able to map the true extent of the
          boy's abilities at all.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 140 &nbsp;Unexpected Team Up?</h2>
        <h2>Chapter 140</h2>
        <p>
          He was sure that despite his withering age, he was countless times
          more powerful than this bunch of kids, yet he was not able to perform
          a task as simple as probing. He could easily sense the other children
          and their levels properly, but for some reason, he was sure that what
          Oliver was showing was not his true level. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he had no proof; it was just an intuition of his that made
          him believe that or think in that direction. Only a gut feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          Either Oliver was using an artifact beyond his years, or Sigfor's age
          was dulling his senses—a thought that both frustrated and concerned
          him.
        </p>
        <p>If it was the artifact then it was too powerful for his own good.</p>
        <p>
          Sigfor had spent decades battling demons, patrolling borders, and
          dealing with the deadliest foes. He had spent a major portion of life
          battling disasters of mankind, he was all too aware of what was and
          could be classified a danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was familiar with the sensations when he fought such deadly demons
          at that time—it was still vivid in his heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          And it was a sensation similar to that whenever he tried to probe into
          Oliver… a strange risk that he felt in his life that was subtle but
          present.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Did Master not notice this?' he wondered, as he was sure that his
          master above the mountains must have felt this abnormality in the boy
          too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or maybe she was not obstructed like he was? He might have to ask her
          about it later to confirm his rising doubts and suspicions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, he had to focus on training these kids and preparing them for
          a future covered with darkness. It took some days, but the group
          slowly got used to controlling their espera flow in the end.
        </p>
        <p>
          The kids would often fail in their attempts, sometimes destroying the
          talisman, blasting it, or just doing something silly at the end step
          and having to do it all again.
        </p>
        <p>All of them were seriously dedicated and never gave up trying.</p>
        <p>
          "Alright, now I will split you all into groups of two. The serious
          things would start from now onwards. Try to complement your teammate.
          It will take time, but it will help you all the way later. In the
          battlefield, any human could become your teammate, so it becomes
          mandatory for you to learn to adapt to your team when your life is on
          the line."
        </p>
        <p>Sigfor said in a very serious and eerie tone.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver knew about this; in the battlefield against demons, any human
          you find becomes your ally automatically in the fight. The more allies
          you have on the field, the better your chances of survival.
        </p>

        <p>"So, here's the match-up:</p>
        <p>Daniel goes with Nadia.</p>
        <p>Alphonso will go with Amber.</p>
        <p>And lastly, Evelyn goes with Oliver."</p>
        <p>He said sternly.</p>
        <p>
          There was a momentary silence after Sigfor announced the line-up
          before Daniel could not help but burst out.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What sort of terrible line-up is this?" he looked with widened eyes
          around before his eyes landed on the emotionless girl. He pointed at
          her as he said, "How did you even think that thunder and ice elements
          could ever be combined together?"
        </p>
        <p>He turned to Sigfor, "Elder, have you finally lost it—"</p>
        <p>Smack!</p>
        <p>
          A loud smack resounded in the air as Daniel was sent flying backward,
          crashing into the desks.
        </p>
        <p>"Pfft-!"</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at Sigfor, who was red with anger and embarrassment.
        </p>
        <p>
          He secretly exclaimed at how bold Daniel was. He could really provoke
          anyone under any circumstances without caring about the consequences.
        </p>
        <p>This was the shamelessness one should strive for.</p>
        <p>
          "Stupid little brat! You dare question me!?" Sigfor spat in anger. He
          roared, "You think I have gone senile!? I am still decades young
          before going crazy due to old age! Stop being ageist!"
        </p>
        <p>Oliver blinked, somehow he found those words quite familiar.</p>

        <p>
          He had to give it to Daniel this time. Although he interrupted and was
          disrespectful, his initial question was valid nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Had he asked this more politely, perhaps Sigfor would have explained
          it deeply as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alas, his tongue was loose and his mind was dense, so it could not be
          helped that Sigfor was furious.
        </p>
        <p>
          After calming down, Sigfor stroked his beard once again, a force of
          habit now, as he keenly looked at the group with his sharp gaze.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't need to think about it. The team I have assigned are
          correct; you just need to do it. There's no other way around it.
          Believe in yourself, you can do it. Also, if you act foolishly, you
          will suffer like that brat over there."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sigfor harrumphed and left the group alone. He did not forget to leave
          them with some talismans, however.
        </p>
        <p>
          These talismans were the real deal, waiting to be filled with the
          espera of an elemental attribute.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well…" Oliver looked at the lying Daniel and then at Nadia, "He
          should be waking up in a few minutes. You can think of what to do…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia had a cold look in her eyes as she gazed at the lying
          black-haired boy. She hated weaklings like him the most.
        </p>
        <p>
          She preferred to do it alone, not with anyone; she was more than
          capable of doing it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes turned frosty. This was all slowly turning pointless. She
          would rather have it that she was sent back to the ice chamber to hone
          her element more or just back to her clan.
        </p>
        <p>But she did not want to be the first to complain or else…</p>
        <p>
          She cast a glance towards Oliver, who had his back facing her as he
          was walking up to Evelyn.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not want him to have any thoughts. Not only was she older than
          him but also stronger; she could not act like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt a pang of hatred toward the old man for not pairing her with
          him instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          Water and ice elements were alike; they were basically one element.
          The ice element was a hybrid element of the water element family.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was a hundred percent sure that her compatibility with his element
          and his compatibility with her element was better than anyone present
          here in this group with them.
        </p>

        <p>
          She was confident that as long as Oliver followed her lead, she could
          easily generate a very deadly attack. Using his element to enhance her
          own element's offensiveness, she could easily overpower everyone
          present with minimal difficulty.
        </p>
        <p>But they were not paired together.</p>
        <p>She turned around and left as well.</p>
        <p>Join for FREE at : /WinterDragon573</p>
        <p>___________</p>
        <p>"Hey, Evelyn…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver reached out to the girl standing next to the pile of talismans,
          looking at him.
        </p>
        <p>"We're teamed up," she smiled.</p>
        <p>
          "Yes. Combining our elements for an attack will be challenging,"
          Oliver admitted, considering how the light element wasn't inherently
          offensive. His water element didn't seem a perfect match.
        </p>
        <p>
          The light element was basically not an offensive element by its
          nature. At least not until the bearer of the element developed it
          later into killing arts.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, Evelyn was not in that league, so her light element was
          basically quite docile in nature, with healing capabilities, blinding
          effects, defense, and all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stuff like that with his water element, he was not sure what to make
          of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, his main goal was not to win the challenge set by Elder
          Sigfor but rather to shift his target to Evelyn from Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the best opportunity he could have gotten so far. He just
          needed to be in physical contact with her for some time before the
          system message appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          He just needed to somehow get in contact with her; he already had a
          plan to achieve that.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let's start by coordinating our espera. Then we can think about
          attack combinations. How about it?" he suggested.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sounds good. Let's get in tune with our espera first," she agreed,
          picking up a talisman and placing it on the desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How should we do it? Hmm…" Oliver started as he said, "First, we
          should channel our espera into the talisman one by one and see if we
          can balance it out. If it does not work like that, then we can try it
          at once."
        </p>
        <p>"Alright, will you go first?"</p>

          espera. In the next try, I will do it all, and you will just have to
          fill it with your light-attributed espera instead."

          it up with your espera. I will then maintain the balance afterward."
