        <h2>Chapter 91: Ophelia's thoughts and suspicion</h2>
        <p>
          Ophelia was now in front of him, her cold and emotionless gray eyes
          looking into his deep amethyst eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          They remained fixed in that position for an unknown amount of time,
          their eyes trying to look into each other as if wanting to discover
          something inside.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver could not bear her emotionless eyes.</p>
        <p>
          His heart felt as if it had been gripped tightly by something. Fear?
        </p>
        <p>
          She was beautiful, but he felt her expression looked like that of a
          psychotic serial killer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her eyes were dead, or he felt as if they were dead; she looked too
          scary for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her head did not even move an inch as she kept staring into him,
          making him think she was a true psychopath.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at Nadia, who was also frozen in her spot, and her
          expression was also unnatural at the moment. He knew that she was also
          scared and could not muster up her courage.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gathered some will and finally spoke, his tone stuttering slightly
          due to the sudden pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          "M-Mother?" he said, looking at her eyes, trying to let out a smile,
          but it crooked up in the end due to the pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          The word 'Mother' felt foreign to him. It had been years since he used
          it, and even now, he did not feel anything emotional from it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead, he felt like he was calling a stranger his mother due to the
          circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia blinked her eyes as she heard him. She was not expecting him
          to even be able to look at her properly.
        </p>
        <p>"You have grown up."</p>

        <p>
          Her cold voice rang in his ears, and he felt that even her words
          carried a presence of their own. His spine tingled for some reason
          when she spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could determine just from looking at him that he had matured more
          than he looked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded. For some reason, he felt even more pressure on his
          shoulders than before.
        </p>
        <p>He knew that she had increased the pressure on him.</p>
        <p>Her gray eyes shone as she looked at her struggling son.</p>
        <p>
          In an instant, he felt as if he had turned naked, as if all his
          secrets were laid bare in front of her.
        </p>
        <p>He felt helpless as he could only stand and watch.</p>
        <p>
          But in the next moment, he saw her eyes showing a sharp glint as she
          seemed to increase her focus.
        </p>
        <p>'Is she also unable to see through the Abyss energy?'</p>
        <p>
          This thought came to his mind, and he sneered at her probing. This was
          good; she wouldn't be able to breach him if that was the case.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was a bit disappointed as there was not much change in her
          reaction. She didn't show surprise, nor did she show anger or
          curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>'Is she even human at this point?'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver wondered as he looked at her emotionless eyes. He felt that she
          was a being without a soul.
        </p>
        <p>A soulless being…</p>
        <p>'Ugh-!'</p>
        <p>
          It seemed that she could not accept the reality that she was not able
          to breach the defenses of a Rank-1 exorcist.
        </p>

        <p>
          She was not satisfied with the average amount of espera that Oliver
          was emitting. Unlike the elders, she knew there was something deeper
          to this all.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, she was the one who had seen him the closest when he was
          born. She was sure that she could never miscalculate or make a mistake
          in such a matter.
        </p>
        <p>Something definitely happened after that.</p>
        <p>
          She did not trust anything in her life, nor did she believe what she
          was seeing with her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but exclaim at how keen this woman's insight
          was. She was indeed very cautious.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was clearly able to sense that he had only a so-so amount of
          espera but still insisted on probing him deeper.
        </p>
        <p>
          But what made him angry was that she kept applying more and more
          pressure on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if she was toying with him, as if she was experimenting on
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was trying to test how much more pressure he would be able to take
          before he gave in and let her enter inside him. Her senses were
          constantly trying to penetrate deeper and deeper but could not get
          past the Abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          She did not think that there was anything he could use to resist her
          power; she was simply just too strong.
        </p>
        <p>
          But looking at his struggling expression, a sharp glint passed through
          her eyes as she slowly increased the pressure even more.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air turned suffocating and cold, and almost all the pressure was
          now focused mostly on Oliver in the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia looked at him and closed her eyes. If her mother wanted
          something from him, then there was no one who could stop her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She simply felt relieved that at least he was not going to be killed.
          Had her mother wanted him to disappear, there was nothing stopping
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver, who was now facing the tremendous pressure, felt helpless.
          Even after his breakthrough and the boost, he was still not able to
          withstand this pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt that if she increased the pressure some more, he might get
          crushed into the ground itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          While Oliver was struggling, he did not dare to give in to her
          attempts. He knew that he must not let her know his true rank;
          otherwise, there was no way he could avoid getting involved in her
          schemes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, he also feared that she might as well brainwash him and
          make him into her puppet.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted a weapon, not a child. He did not know about her end goal,
          but he was sure of a single thing: she wanted to make the strongest
          exorcist in the world, be it herself or someone she could control.
        </p>
        <p>
          He must avoid letting any information be known. At least he would try
          his best; the rest depended on the situation and circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia, on the other hand, narrowed her eyes. What Oliver and Nadia
          did not know was that the amount of pressure she was currently
          releasing was not something any novice exorcist candidate could bear
          and stand still.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pressure was past the limit of what Oliver should have been able
          to endure, given the amount of espera he was showing to the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was purposefully releasing enough pressure that only a Rank-1
          exorcist could bear.
        </p>
        <p>Today had been quite the day.</p>
        <p>
          First was the phenomenon. She had clearly sensed the gathering of
          energies being focused near this place.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had sensed the presence of both Nadia and Oliver together at this
          place. There was no way such a massive phenomenon would occur for no
          reason, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why was it more concentrated at this place, at this point where the
          two of them were?
        </p>
        <p>
          And now that she was there, the energies dissipated out of existence
          or were concealed by someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside the chambers, she sensed Nadia's presence along with another
          familiar presence she knew from some years ago.
        </p>
        <p>What surprised her was his current state.</p>
        <p>
          Not only had his physique improved to that of a Rank-1 exorcist, but
          also his eyes… she felt something weird about them.
        </p>
        <p>
          And now when she was trying to sense what was happening inside him
          through her senses, she was unable to find anything out of ordinary.
          Her senses could not pass through, something inside him was definitely
          interfering.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was not sure about it but there was no other explanation to how he
          was able to withstand her pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was someone who had long passed through the realms of a normal
          exorcist, there were things that she could see and others not. Not to
          mention, the experience she had far surpassed most.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus she was able to conclude that the reason why she couldn't sense
          anything extraordinary from him was not that he actually had nothing
          going on but instead he was hiding something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he might not have noticed this but his presence was
          dimmer than an ordinary child. It was nothing significant but it was
          there….
        </p>
        <p>No matter what, it was going to be revealed soon.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 92: Intense moment interrupted!</h2>
        <p>
          It was just her hunch, but there was definitely something going on
          behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would soon find out. She just had to penetrate him with her
          senses, and she could know it all—his brain, his body, his
          espera—nothing would escape her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>Every bit of information would soon be in front of her.</p>
        <p>
          Whether there was really something special about this son of hers or
          not…
        </p>
        <p>Whether she had indeed made a mistake at his birth or not…</p>
        <p>It would soon become clear.</p>
        <p>
          She would devise her next course of actions based on that information…
        </p>
        <p>She knew the moment she laid her eyes on him.</p>
        <p>
          To peel off his coverings, she tried to probe him, but contrary to her
          expectations, she was quite puzzled when she could not sense past him.
        </p>
        <p>
          All she could feel around him was a slightly above-average amount of
          espera and heightened physical strength.
        </p>
        <p>'But how?' she could not help but ponder.</p>
        <p>
          This boy was the 'useless' one when he was born, but today not only
          did he have espera but also raw strength.
        </p>
        <p>She applied more pressure and continued to probe him.</p>
        <p>
          But to her puzzlement, he was doing well under the pressure for a
          Rank-1 exorcist.
        </p>
        <p>How was this even possible?</p>
        <p>
          She thought for a moment that perhaps his physical strength had
          crossed the threshold of a Rank-1 exorcist, so he was able to endure
          the pressure.
        </p>
        <p>But still, something did not make sense in the back of her mind.</p>

        <p>
          She continuously kept increasing the pressure, but he was still able
          to stand normally and speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          It got to the point where the pressure she was focusing on him was way
          past the threshold of a newly made Rank-1 exorcist's limits.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was well beyond that point. She knew that Nadia had broken through
          and similarly released only that much amount of pressure initially to
          test her out.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at this point, her main focus was Oliver. The pressure alone was
          enough to make almost any Rank-1 collapse to their knees.
        </p>
        <p>Yet he was still able to maintain his stance.</p>
        <p>'He's hiding something.'</p>
        <p>Her eyes turned even colder when she realized this.</p>
        <p>
          He was a creation of hers, and he had no right to hide anything from
          her. If she had not intended it, he wouldn't have been born.
        </p>
        <p>So, he must obey her and never hide anything from her.</p>
        <p>This was the reality and should be the law for them.</p>
        <p>She has to teach him who he was and where he stands.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes widened as the pressure suddenly became too much for
          him. From Ophelia's face, he could not discern a single emotion; it
          seemed nothing had changed on her face.
        </p>
        <p>Why was she so focused on forcing him?</p>
        <p>Why was she not satisfied after sensing what he was showing?</p>
        <p>
          He cursed under his breath, feeling his blood rush to his head as his
          legs started to shake slightly.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes narrowed, and anger welled up in his heart. If push came to
          shove, he wouldn't care and would use every power he had if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          And… he also had 'that' if he wanted to escape far away from this
          place.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as she was about to give the final push and crush him completely,
          an unexpected voice rang out in the chambers.
        </p>
        <p>"Meow~"</p>

        <p>_______________________</p>
        <p>
          Everyone present in the chambers paused and turned to look at the new
          arrival.
        </p>
        <p>It was a beautiful, pristine white cat.</p>
        <p>She was calmly sitting at the entrance, looking at their faces.</p>
        <p>
          The head-judge, who had been kneeling all this while without even
          daring to move, also looked up.
        </p>
        <p>'Clan guardian!? Why's she here? Did something happen?'</p>
        <p>
          His eyes shot open as he saw her. She was an existence that barely
          showed herself in public…
        </p>
        <p>
          Half of the clan elders had only ever heard about her and never
          personally met her.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was said that she was a divine existence and could bring fortune to
          those who received her favor and blessings.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was aware of her identity because he had the fortune to meet her a
          few times in the past when he was young. Their meetings had always
          been short, and he had always been accompanied by a group of elders of
          very high standing and seniority whenever he met her.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had heard rumors that she could read fate by observing the stars in
          the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was always accompanied by the elites, the founding pillars of the
          clan whenever he had seen her.
        </p>
        <p>She enjoyed a very noble status in the clan.</p>
        <p>For her to suddenly appear here, what was the reason?</p>
        <p>
          It was apparent that she had come for a purpose. Greeting the clan
          guardian and being in her presence was an honor for him.
        </p>
        <p>However…</p>
        <p>He still did not move from his spot, not an inch.</p>
        <p>
          Mistress Ophelia was here. If the clan guardian enjoyed a noble
          status, then Mistress Ophelia had a royal status.
        </p>
        <p>He was not allowed to move unless she ordered him to.</p>

        <p>Ophelia did not turn around to face the cat.</p>
        <p>Her eyes were still fixated on her son, Oliver.</p>
        <p>
          But when the meow sounded out, Oliver felt the pressure on him lessen
          significantly. He huffed slightly in relief.
        </p>
        <p>"Meow!"</p>
        <p>
          The cat jumped over and landed directly in front of Oliver—in between
          the mother and the son.
        </p>
        <p>Nadia, on the other hand, was utterly confused at the moment.</p>
        <p>A white cat?</p>
        <p>
          What was a cat doing here? She had read about cats but never seen one
          in real life, so it was also her first time seeing one so close in
          person and not in pictures and books.
        </p>
        <p>But how did a cat enter the clan?</p>
        <p>
          The clan had a barrier that repelled or prevented the entry of
          anything unauthorized inside.
        </p>
        <p>So it puzzled her how this cat appeared.</p>
        <p>
          She did not find it abnormal that a cat could jump so high and land so
          carefully and precisely between her brother and mother.
        </p>
        <p>
          She believed it might be how cats were, nothing more, nothing less.
        </p>
        <p>She assumed many theories in an instant.</p>
        <p>
          It was possible that a merchant had brought her from outside using
          special permissions to be sold in the clan market.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or it was possible that an alchemist asked for the cat to experiment
          on…
        </p>
        <p>There were many possibilities.</p>
        <p>
          But her heart could not thump any louder when she realized that her
          mother had been interrupted.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt nothing as she thought about how the cat was going to die.
        </p>
        <p>
          If possible, she would have liked to touch it before its death, but
          she could do it after it died as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main thing right now was what her mother wanted from Oliver, for
          some reason, her heart was not calm at all when she saw him quivering
          earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had hoped that their mother would let him leave now that she had
          been interrupted by the cat.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the cat could be sacrificed to divert her mother's attention, then
          so be it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unknowingly, Nadia had already marked the clan guardian as good as
          dead. In her eyes, she felt that the best use for the cat would be to
          become a sacrifice so that Oliver could leave from here.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 93: Rewarding the good cat!</h2>
        <p>"Meow…"</p>
        <p>
          The cat meowed at Ophelia, whose focus had now shifted from Oliver to
          the cat instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          She narrowed her eyes as she calmly observed the cat, who was waving
          her tiny paws at her and then at Oliver, as if indicating something.
        </p>
        <p>"…."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at the clan guardian and felt speechless. What was she
          trying to say?
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia observed the cat. She was naturally aware of her identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          She glanced back at him, her eyes flickering briefly as if she were
          contemplating many things.
        </p>
        <p>
          A look of comprehension spread across her face, as if she had just
          pieced together a hidden puzzle.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sinister glint flickered in her eyes, unnoticed by anyone except the
          clan guardian.
        </p>
        <p>
          What could Ophelia be plotting now? Her mind raced with possibilities,
          each more chilling than the last.
        </p>
        <p>The cat knew that gaze. Ophelia was scheming something terrible.</p>
        <p>
          Her heart could not help but sink. She knew now Ophelia was already
          developing plans involving Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian had seen countless schemers and politicians, but
          none could even compete with this emotionless woman.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even she herself could never understand her actions. But one thing the
          cat knew was that every action of Ophelia brought cruelty.
        </p>
        <p>One crueler than the other.</p>
        <p>
          She was that dangerous, but unfortunately, as the clan guardian, she
          did not have the power or authority to oppose her.
        </p>

        <p>Ophelia was way stronger than her, after all.</p>
        <p>
          Was protecting Oliver worth the potential backlash? The clan guardian
          pondered, weighing her loyalty against the situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was already going beyond her bounds by shielding Oliver here. It
          might even risk her dearly in the future too.
        </p>
        <p>Whatever it was, now that she has decided, she cannot back off.</p>
        <p>
          But she had no choice. Oliver's case was just that special and
          sensitive. She could not allow Ophelia's shadow to fall on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, with his powers, he might become the worst threat to this
          world under Ophelia's influence.
        </p>
        <p>"Meow—"</p>
        <p>The cat meowed and looked at Ophelia in her eyes.</p>
        <p>Her actions conveyed a simple message to her.</p>
        <p>'He's under my protection. Leave now.'</p>
        <p>
          Of course, Ophelia was not obligated to follow the clan guardian's
          words, but in that moment, she did something unexpected.
        </p>
        <p>She looked over at Nadia and called out, "Follow me."</p>
        <p>
          After throwing a glance in her son's direction, she left the chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
          What did that final glance mean? Oliver couldn't shake off the feeling
          that it was a silent warning.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian had expected Ophelia to ignore her and use force,
          but, as always, Ophelia was unpredictable.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia knew that since the clan guardian had so, this meant that his
          abnormal growth and the mysterious incident was all being watched by
          the clan guardian.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          'She's definitely going to plan something. It seems that I need to
          rush my plan before something happens.'
        </p>

        <p>Zippy sighed as she thought of the risky plan in her mind.</p>
        <p>'It cannot be delayed now.'</p>
        <p>
          Just as she was in her thoughts, Oliver picked her up from behind.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Zippy, why did you come here? Didn't I ask you to go home and wait
          for food?" he asked with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>The clan guardian had proven herself to be quite useful today.</p>
        <p>
          He had always thought that she was there for his rations, but
          unexpectedly, she had helped him not once but twice today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head judge looked at him, his eyes popping out of his sockets as
          he saw this kid casually pick up the esteemed clan guardian and pet
          her.
        </p>
        <p>This level of disrespect…</p>
        <p>
          But he seemed to know the cat, and the clan guardian also did not seem
          to mind. More like, she did not even reveal her identity here.
        </p>
        <p>
          A thought crossed his mind as he wondered if the clan guardian did not
          wish for her identity to be exposed.
        </p>
        <p>He was quite confused.</p>
        <p>
          First, it was Mistress Ophelia who was pressuring this kid for some
          reason, but then the clan guardian arrived, and for some reason,
          Mistress Ophelia left directly.
        </p>
        <p>What was up with this kid?</p>
        <p>Things were definitely not simple.</p>
        <p>
          For two of the clan's supreme existences to arrive at a single place
          and meet a single kid, and that too right after that earlier
          phenomenon in the sky.
        </p>
        <p>'Was that related to him…?'</p>
        <p>
          He remembered how Oliver had disappeared just before the incident and
          how he returned just after the phenomenon was over.
        </p>

        <p>
          Could Oliver be linked to the mysterious event? The head judge's
          curiosity grew more.
        </p>
        <p>He secretly made a note to investigate more later.</p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>
          After everyone left, Oliver said to the cat, "Today, I will make
          something delicious. I remember purchasing meat."
        </p>
        <p>
          The worried cat's ears perked up when she heard this, and her eyes
          started to twinkle.
        </p>
        <p>
          She pounced on him, and Oliver caught her and left the chambers as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          He needed some time to familiarize himself with his newfound powers
          and the things he was now able to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was relieved that he saved himself from getting his cover blown
          fully in front of her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She would have one hundred percent brainwashed him into an
          emotionless, lifeless, colorless killing machine had she realized his
          true potential now.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that if that happened, there would be no point in living a
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon arriving at his courtyard, he directly headed to the kitchen. The
          cat deserved a treat!
        </p>
        <p>
          Setting aside training for a while, he was quite hungry as all he ate
          in the forest was some fruits and seeds. It did not satisfy him at
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          He used the meat available on the shelves. The world had different
          sorts of meats that he was initially not familiar with, but after some
          time, he started to like the taste of the fantasy meat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each cut of meat seemed to hold its own elegance, flavors waiting to
          be discovered. Oliver's knife moved with practiced ease, slicing
          through the interesting textures.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since he was hungry, he focused on preparing a small meal first
          for himself and the cat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the months, his cooking skills had improved significantly as he
          cooked for himself rather than relying on the maids.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon, a small meat-based meal suitable for two was prepared. It was an
          afternoon meal.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was stewed rump eaten with bland bread. The rump was naturally
          strong in flavor, it was just barely seasoned with strong oils, and
          eaten with fish.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fish was properly seasoned with herbs and salts. It was just the
          right amount.
        </p>
        <p>"Meow!"</p>
        <p>
          The cat jumped up and down as the aroma filled the room. This was the
          best time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to Oliver's participation in the demon hunt, she had not tasted
          this cooking for a long time. Now she was ready to devour it all!
        </p>
        <p>Good treat!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 94: Mind space! A spy?</h2>
        <p>
          Just like that, a few weeks passed as everyone settled back into their
          lives.
        </p>
        <p>
          The phenomenon was roughly rounded up as well since no one was able to
          find the cause or reason for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian was questioned by a group of worried elders, but she
          didn't tell anything useful and only dropped vague sentences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head-judge, who had some clues that it was regarding Oliver, also
          investigated more, but in the end, after a few months of continuous
          investigation, he could not find anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that Mistress Ophelia surely knew something as well, but he
          did not dare to tell the other elders about that.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wouldn't even know how he died the next day; Mistress Ophelia kept
          her private affairs private. No one was allowed to talk about her and
          any action she took unless provided permission by her personally.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only drink his frustrations and silently observe Oliver. He
          didn't dare get too close to him either; the clan guardian was with
          him, and he didn't want to offend her.
        </p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>In one of the courtyards.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was sitting cross-legged, and in front of him were multiple
          empty vials that once contained various expensive potions.
        </p>
        <p>From vitality-enhancing potions to espera-strengthening potions.</p>
        <p>He had gulped down all of them.</p>
        <p>He was getting used to handling the large amount of espera.</p>
        <p>'So this is Abyss energy…'</p>

        <p>
          He thought in his head as his hand was suddenly coated in a dark
          blackish-red hue.
        </p>
        <p>The energy was potent and pulsing with dread and power.</p>
        <p>'It is stronger than espera…'</p>
        <p>
          On his other hand, a colorless energy flowed out. It was gentle and
          completely still.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was his espera. He had already managed to completely stabilize it
          thanks to the enhanced talent he now had.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, after his monthly allowance had increased twofold, he
          was able to spend his time in luxury as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could buy any potion he wanted in the clan market without batting
          an eye or get any weapon he had wanted without worrying about the
          cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the help of multiple potions, he was able to suppress his espera
          and coordinate his increased physical strength as well.
        </p>
        <p>His body was also now full of energy.</p>
        <p>He gazed at his now improved body analysis.</p>
        <p>_______________</p>
        <p>[Name: Oliver Mystic]</p>
        <p>[Race: Human]</p>
        <p>[Status: Rank-1]</p>
        <p>[Strength: Level 5]</p>

        <p>[Espera: Level 4]</p>
        <p>[Abyss Energy: Level 3]</p>
        <p>[Charisma: Level 3]</p>
        <p>[Luck: Level 4]</p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>
          In the weeks he had been sorting out the unknown knowledge he had
          received when his body became an Abyss circuit.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had managed to make two clusters in his mind, one that he had some
          idea about, and the other cluster carried the knowledge that was too
          complex for his current level to even comprehend.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seemed that he had now become a creature of Abyss, thus gaining
          resistance against any sort of divinities.
        </p>
        <p>
          He smiled. Although this meant that he might never be able to access
          divine energy, it was good because he had Abyss energy, something very
          difficult to obtain.
        </p>
        <p>
          He closed his eyes, and the next moment he opened them, he was in a
          pitch-black space.
        </p>
        <p>Everything here was pitch black.</p>
        <p>It was his mind space.</p>
        <p>
          Something he was able to access after he became a circuit of Abyss.
        </p>
        <p>
          He gazed down at himself, and his entire body had turned white. In the
          whole dark space, he alone was the whitest thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          His whole body had turned featureless, and he was like a being with
          nothing but a white-colored form. No face, nothing…&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p>From head to toe, everything was featureless and pure white.</p>
        <p>
          The space was quite large and wide. It was unknown where it ended, but
          he could sense it was limited.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the knowledge he had acquired, he knew that as long as he grew
          stronger, it should expand likewise. The Abyss energy was low in
          quantity, but it was quite potent nonetheless.
        </p>
        <p>
          His gaze wandered in the black space before landing on some weapons
          that were casually lying around.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the advantage of having a mind space, he had canceled the need to
          have a storage ring as he could directly store his belongings in the
          mind space, which was countless times safer than any storage ring.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he still purchased a storage ring in order to let others
          know that he was not an abnormality and used the storage ring to get
          his items.
        </p>
        <p>'The clan is indeed generous when they recognize you.'</p>
        <p>
          He thought as he gently touched the ring on his finger. These rings
          were very expensive, and even with his monthly allowance, he was
          hesitant to buy one.
        </p>
        <p>
          But fortunately, the clan gifted him one a few days after that
          incident. He suspected that the head-judge was involved in him
          receiving this ring, considering how he was the sole witness to what
          happened in the chambers and had authority over other elders for such
          tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter what, the ring was empty, and everything from the good
          quality weapons that he had purchased to potions was now all stored
          inside his mind space.
        </p>
        <p>He came out of his mind space and got up.</p>
        <p>He could finally feel the espera, an overflowing energy.</p>
        <p>
          His water element had never been more active. He could feel its force
          and effect increase multiple times as well.
        </p>
        <p>'I can start to get creative with the element now…'</p>
        <p>
          Earlier, it had been pretty much difficult for him to utilize the
          water element for anything other than a small water ball, but now
          things were no longer the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stood up. At the moment, he was in the secret spot behind his
          courtyard surrounded by trees.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a hot day, and he was sweating buckets, so he packed things up
          and went back to the courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon reaching the courtyard, he was greeted by an unexpected voice
          that was not there before and he was not used to.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Welcome back, young master." A woman in a maid uniform bowed as she
          used a towel to quickly help him wipe the sweat.
        </p>
        <p>He stopped her and did it on his own as he glanced at the woman.</p>
        <p>This woman was a spy.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 95: Joint-training? A program?</h2>
        <p>
          She was the new personal maid assigned to him after the event. He felt
          that the main reason she was here was to spy on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The head-judge must be quite anxious after seeing the clan guardian,
          so he directly called out to one of his subordinates to keep an eye on
          him.
        </p>
        <p>'I cannot sense her rank at all.'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver secretly shook his head. This woman was clearly a strong
          exorcist but was now role-playing as a maid.
        </p>
        <p>The head-judge truly was meticulous in his preparations.</p>
        <p>
          The woman had long black hair and champagne-colored eyes. She was tall
          and beautiful, and her expression was professional.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the week since she had come to serve under him as a personal maid,
          his chores were directly eliminated. From laundry to cooking to
          shopping, she did everything before he even had the need to.
        </p>
        <p>
          He exclaimed when he was going to cook, but the maid stopped him from
          doing that, stating it was below him as the young master of the clan
          to do chores like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but snicker at that time. Where was this dignity
          when he was alone?
        </p>
        <p>
          The behavior of others has also improved considerably since the demon
          hunt event's news spread out.
        </p>
        <p>
          They no longer ignored him and even treated him with respect. His
          courtyard, which had earlier been ignored, was now tended to regularly
          by a team of gardeners and servants.
        </p>

        <p>Not to mention, there were now guards stationed around the area.</p>
        <p>'This feels more like a restriction than a privilege to me.'</p>
        <p>
          He could not help it. After all, he was used to living alone with a
          lot of freedom.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there were some advantages to the situation as well since he was
          able to access the places in the central area which he was previously
          not allowed entry to.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Young master, your clothes have been prepared and the bath water has
          been prepared as per your preferences."
        </p>
        <p>The maid said in a calm tone. Her name was Sesha.</p>
        <p>Sesha Bureh.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but feel that the surname 'Bureh' was familiar
          to him, but he could not remember where he had heard of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          'It was definitely in the novel, but where…?' He pressed his head as
          he thought about it, but nothing rang a bell.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had been years since he read that novel. He had a good memory
          thanks to being born with the blood of strong exorcists and the espera
          in the atmosphere making his brain more functional.
        </p>
        <p>But still, he was not able to tell when this name was mentioned.</p>
        <p>
          Since he could not remember it, he had been keeping a distance from
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not sure if the name was associated with demonic forces or
          exorcists. Nonetheless, she was dangerous, and he was wary of her.
        </p>

        <p>He nodded at her and went inside to bathe.</p>
        <p>Today was a somewhat special day.</p>
        <p>
          He was going to meet with children from the other five clans for the
          first time!
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, he was going to leave the clan for the first time in
          his life!
        </p>
        <p>
          He suddenly recalled the brief meeting he had with an elder from the
          clan after the demon hunt some days ago.
        </p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>"Say again?"</p>
        <p>
          "You!" The elder's eyelids twitched fiercely when he heard the boy's
          words. He had just explained everything, but this brat was still
          asking for him to repeat everything again.
        </p>
        <p>He could not help but be frustrated.</p>
        <p>
          "Calm down, elder. It was just an expression," the boy smiled
          gleefully, looking at the frustrated elder.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So basically, to summarize, the five great clans have agreed to
          familiarize their children with each other and train under a joint
          program for the ones with potential together due to the looming threat
          of demons that could start a war at any moment?"
        </p>
        <p>The boy summarized what he heard.</p>
        <p>"That's right," the elder nodded, "you finally get it."</p>

        <p>
          "Of course," the boy smiled. "And among the children selected, my name
          was also chosen due to the results of the demon hunt?"
        </p>
        <p>The elder paused briefly and explained.</p>
        <p>
          "Out of the clan's main heirs, you and Miss Nadia have been selected
          for this… your age and talent match the best with the other candidates
          selected by the other five clans."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a great honor! Be respectful that the higher-ups considered you
          in the first place!" The elder's eyes almost bulged out of their
          sockets when he saw the ungrateful expression the boy was making.
        </p>
        <p>He almost had the urge to beat him up, but he refrained.</p>
        <p>
          The boy who was sitting opposite the elder stretched his hands and
          folded them back behind his head as a pondering look appeared on his
          face.
        </p>
        <p>His silver hair flowed against the wind as he stared at the sky.</p>
        <p>
          "What a coincidence. From all the five pairs of twins, how is it
          possible that Nadia and I were the ones selected? I don't think the
          third brother and sister are much older than us?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder could not endure it and stood up, saying in a loud tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You bastard-! Do you think we deliberately put your name forward! Do
          you dare believe that I won't break your legs here right now for
          doubting the supreme elders!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder, who clearly had a short temper, looked at the lazy boy with
          anger as he further added,
        </p>
        <p>
          "After what you did to the third pair of siblings. Do you still
          believe they are worthy enough to join this program? Those useless
          brats who couldn't even handle a single brat with no espera!? DO YOU
          BELIEVE THAT?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The boy hurriedly corrected his posture and put his hands forward as
          he said in a calm tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whoa, elder! Calm down, I never said I doubted the decision of your
          superiors."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am a proud heir of the Mystic Purge Clan. How can I be so
          ungrateful, right?" His eyes curved into a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "If you have thought about it, then there must be a reason why I was
          selected. I will honor the wishes of my esteemed elders and definitely
          participate and establish dominance in front of the other children
          from the other clans."
        </p>
        <p>The elder visibly calmed down as he heard the boy's words.</p>
        <p>
          It seemed he was the one being more flustered. The elder sighed and
          looked at the laid-back boy, he still could not understand why he was
          suddenly selected either.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 96: The taste of luxury</h2>
        <p>
          "If you have thought about it, then there must be a reason why I was
          selected. I will honor the wishes of my esteemed elders and definitely
          participate and establish dominance in front of the other children
          from the other clans."
        </p>
        <p>The elder visibly calmed down as he heard the boy's words.</p>
        <p>
          It seemed he had been too impatient and misjudged the boy earlier.
        </p>
        <p>
          "By the way, elder, I was curious about something…" he looked the
          elder in the eyes, "…did mother agree to this as well?"
        </p>
        <p>The elder narrowed his eyes when he mentioned the word 'mother'.</p>
        <p>
          "Of course, Mistress Ophelia gave us permission. That's why I said
          this was a big honor to be a part of this."
        </p>
        <p>
          The boy nodded with a solemn expression and asked, "What preparations
          do I need to make?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nothing for now. We will tell you the date when we will be leaving.
          The first meeting will be a brief introduction between you kids to
          familiarize yourselves with each other and gain an understanding of
          your rivals."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You will be trained personally by professionals… Establish the
          dominance of the clan. Miss Nadia has already been informed. You only
          need to support her and help her establish the clan's dominance."
        </p>
        <p>He informed the kid, who calmly nodded.</p>
        <p>"Then I'll be waiting for the day."</p>
        <p>With that, the boy was left alone.</p>
        <p>After the elder left, he could not help but laugh to himself.</p>
        <p>"Finally, I can leave this clan for once, hahaha!"</p>

        <p>The boy was naturally none other than Oliver.</p>
        <p>_____________</p>
        <p>
          After taking a comforting bath in his private pool, he quickly dressed
          up.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wore a designer kimono specifically tailored for him. It was black
          in color—a contrast to his silver hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but these clothes were quite expensive as they were
          made of rare materials. After all, he was supposed to meet others from
          the five great clans that had been there since the Mystic Purge Clan
          was founded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clothes he wore even had a special property to remain fragrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          He came out of his courtyard and looked at the fat cat lying inside
          after eating two servings of large meals. He sighed; this cat was so
          lazy.
        </p>
        <p>She seemed to be getting fat slowly, as he had expected.</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but wonder about the program that the elder had
          mentioned to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was no such program or details about training in such a way in
          the novel. He wondered if it was a behind-the-scenes thing but
          discarded that notion too.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt suspicious of this fat cat in front of him too. How come his
          name was selected out of all of his siblings?
        </p>
        <p>
          Surely, it couldn't be due to the fact that they were twins that they
          were selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          'If I remember correctly, the first pair of siblings should be in the
          institute right now, so it's understandable that they weren't
          selected.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver shook his head. He threw one last glance toward the lazy cat.
          He might be thinking too much in the end.
        </p>
        <p>How could this fat cat be behind his name getting selected?</p>

        <p>
          She should be smart enough not to repeat herself after the last
          incident, no?
        </p>
        <p>
          He nodded to himself as he looked at the cat who woke up from her
          sleep and looked at him with lazy eyes.
        </p>
        <p>She waved her paw at him as if saying goodbye.</p>
        <p>"…"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver ignored her and left toward the exit of his courtyard, where
          his personal maid in uniform was standing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Behind her was a car, a modern invention of this world, mainly used
          for transportation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car had a sleek and aerodynamic shape with an organic, almost
          living appearance. The design on the car was carefully made as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car had an intricate lattice of vines and leaves etched on its
          surface that glowed from time to time, suggesting its connection to
          natural elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had four large crystalline wheels. These wheels glowed with a soft
          light and could adapt their shape to provide optimal traction on any
          terrain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The engine was nothing but a core powered using fire-attributed
          espera, ensuring great speed and a smooth experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could not help but take a deep breath as he gazed at the luxurious
          car. He knew from a glance that it was far better than those ordinary
          cars used in normal human cities.
        </p>
        <p>
          This car definitely showed the wealth and power of one of the five
          great clans. He knew that it must belong to the elder who was going
          along with them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maid looked at his stunned face and elegantly bowed with a stoic
          expression, as if the car behind her was not worth her attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Young master, the car is ready, please…" she said as she slowly
          opened the door for him to enter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver quickly entered the car and was again pleasantly surprised. The
          interior was way more spacious than it looked from outside.
        </p>

        <p>
          He could notice some glowing runes carved inside that were most likely
          used to expand the space within.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seats inside were made out of special leather, making them
          incredibly soft and magically adjustable to provide perfect comfort
          and support to the occupant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the interior was also lined with Luminous Moss that
          provided a soft amber light, giving a warm and natural feeling.
        </p>
        <p>
          To communicate and issue commands to the driver, there was a dashboard
          made out of a crystal orb to work as the central unit that helped
          display information and drive using the thoughts of the driver with
          espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          His head was filled with the thought of owning such a car in the
          future. It was way better than any car he had ever sat inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, in his previous life, due to his eye problems, he was
          very limited in driving. But now, he could drive freely and as much as
          he wanted to.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the corner and saw an elder sitting in front of the
          dashboard, probably communicating with the driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          He did not speak much and quietly sat in one corner of the car. His
          maid soon followed inside.
        </p>
        <p>'She's also tagging along?'</p>
        <p>His eyes narrowed as he saw her sitting in front of him.</p>
        <p>
          "Young master, if you need anything, do let me know," she said,
          looking at him.
        </p>
        <p>He nodded and shifted his focus to the runes.</p>
        <p>
          Although he was not able to comprehend these runes, he knew there were
          many of them all around the car, serving different functions and
          features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of them must be for shielding purposes as well in case someone
          tried to attack the moving car.
        </p>
        <p>
          The car moved. If not for the windows, he wouldn't even have realized
          it was moving due to how smooth it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few minutes later, from the window, he saw the car stopping near a
          familiar courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>It was Nadia's courtyard.</p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, she emerged out wearing a plain but elegant kimono, she
          was brimming with a heavy aura around her possibly due to the fact
          that she had stabilized herself after the recent breakthrough to
          Rank-1.
        </p>
        <p>
          The espera around her was calm and still and her expression was also
          serene.
        </p>
        <p>Coupled with that outfit, she looked like a princess truly.</p>
        <p>
          The door opened as she too got inside only to pause in her tracks when
          she noticed the unfamiliar individual.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 97: She lost control! Abyssal being?</h2>
        <p>"Welcome, young miss."</p>
        <p>
          The maid opened the door for her as she got in, and the elder also
          greeted her politely.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey?"</p>
        <p>
          He waved at her. She was wearing a pale red-colored kimono and looked
          like a true lady from a rich clan.
        </p>
        <p>
          She raised her brow, ignoring Oliver. Her eyes went up to the new
          woman.
        </p>
        <p>'Who is she?'</p>
        <p>
          She narrowed her eyes as she tried to gauge the woman. She had maid
          clothes…
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver saw this and quickly interrupted, introducing them to each
          other,
        </p>
        <p>
          "She's Sesha, my new personal maid. The elders were feeling generous
          and decided to assign her to me."
        </p>
        <p>The calm maid also looked at Nadia for a moment and bowed.</p>
        <p>
          "Greetings, young miss. I am Sesha Bureh, young master Oliver's
          personal maid and attendant. Feel free to ask for my assistance. I'll
          do my best to aid you."
        </p>
        <p>Nadia's eyes didn't stop looking at the woman.</p>

        <p>
          In that very instant, her eyes shone with a mysterious glint. As her
          eyes darkened, she activated her special vision.
        </p>
        <p>'She's strong…'</p>
        <p>
          That's what she quickly concluded after seeing the tremendous amount
          of espera radiating out of her.
        </p>
        <p>'Hmm…?'</p>
        <p>
          However, her eyes did not stop as she started to see an extremely dark
          red aura inside the car.
        </p>
        <p>
          She moved her head, following the trail of energy, and as her eyes
          landed on Oliver, they could not help but tremble.
        </p>
        <p>
          Right beside her, he was sitting calmly while looking at her with
          curious eyes.
        </p>
        <p>But what she was seeing was completely different in that instant.</p>
        <p>
          At that moment, instead of the normal lazy Oliver, she saw something
          else… something dreadful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Instead of the normal Oliver that she was used to seeing, there was no
          trace of him… or his humane self.
        </p>
        <p>
          But rather, what was in front of her eyes was a pitch-black being
          oozing with a very darkish red energy…
        </p>
        <p>
          The figure seemed to absorb all light around it, creating a void of
          absolute darkness. The pitch-black body had no discernible features,
          only an endless abyss that made her feel as if she was staring into
          the depths of a nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>
          This sinister presence was so intense that it felt as if the very air
          was being sucked into the blackness, leaving a vacuum of suffocating
          dread around him.
        </p>

        <p>
          The dark red energy pouring out of him was not just a glow but a
          thick, pulsating essence that seemed alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          It oozed from every inch of his form, flowing like a malignant fog.
          This energy was a deep, repulsive crimson, swirling with malevolence
          and dread. It moved with a slow, menacing life of its own, creating a
          vile miasma that threatened to consume everything in its path.
        </p>
        <p>
          The espera did not even dare to approach the thick miasma as if
          fearing getting consumed by it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was as if the world itself refused to acknowledge his existence, a
          sinister void that repelled all life and light.
        </p>
        <p>
          The sight was overwhelmingly terrifying. A raw, primal fear gripped
          her chest. The dark red energy seemed to seep into her very soul,
          filling her with a paralyzing horror that made it difficult to even
          think.
        </p>
        <p>
          The once-familiar face of Oliver was gone, replaced by this
          featureless, pitch-black figure that radiated nothing but malice and
          despair.
        </p>
        <p>The being was the definition of primal fear.</p>
        <p>
          The sight of him, the feel of that dark energy, made her feel as if
          she was teetering on the edge of an endless abyss, one wrong step away
          from being swallowed whole by the darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia could feel her heart racing uncontrollably, the blood pounding
          in her ears as she struggled to maintain her composure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every instinct screamed at her to run, to get away from this
          nightmarish being, but she was frozen in place, trapped by the sheer
          terror of the sight before her.
        </p>
        <p>Her eyes were starting to turn misty...</p>
        <p>
          Oliver, on the other hand, looked at her confusedly, wondering what
          she was staring at so intensely. He felt awkward as he saw her dead
          serious eyes as if she was boring a hole into him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as he was about to say something to lift up the suddenly heavy
          atmosphere, he saw a flash of silver right before his eyes.
        </p>

        <p>
          His hand moved automatically due to the constant training with weapons
          he had been doing and his new strength worked into action as he
          blocked.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hand caught the body of a sharp silver sword that was aimed at his
          head. His instincts were sharper than before.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes widened suddenly as he saw Nadia attacking him out of nowhere
          with her sword. Had he not reacted in time, she would have already
          slashed off his head.
        </p>
        <p>Hiss!</p>
        <p>
          He winced in pain as he could feel the sharpness of the high-quality
          sword slowly cutting through his hand like slicing through butter.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly looked at her and noticed that her eyes seemed to have lost
          focus for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before he could guess what was even happening, his hand started to
          burn in pain as the sword cut through his flesh.
        </p>
        <p>"Agh-!"</p>
        <p>
          Before he could push her away, the maid in front of them reacted and
          dragged Nadia away from Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had a surprised look on her face when she saw how young Miss Nadia
          nearly tried to kill her young master in an instant for no reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was too out of the blue. She narrowed her eyes as Nadia resisted
          her grip, but she still maintained it nonetheless. Due to the
          difference in strength, she was able to suppress her easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver gasped in relief and quickly retrieved a healing potion from
          his mind space, starting to quickly gulp it down.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pain in his hand started to dull as his skin began to mend itself
          back to how it was before.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at her struggling expression and realized her problem. Just
          now, she must have used her special eyes to look through them.
        </p>
        <p>
          But because of the presence of Abyss energy, she lost her focus and
          attacked him due to the instinctive fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned. She was able to see through it, and it had such an adverse
          effect on her. These special eyes of hers were called Abyss eyes, so
          it seemed that they had the capability to see his abyss energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to him becoming a circuit of Abyss, he was sure his body had
          turned into something inhuman, some sort of abomination.
        </p>
        <p>This could explain her exaggerated reaction as well.</p>
        <p>But now the problem was how to get her back to normal?</p>

        <h2>Chapter 98: Suppressing her! Arriving at the destination!</h2>
        <p>
          Due to him becoming a circuit of Abyss, he was sure his body had
          turned into something inhuman, some sort of abomination.
        </p>
        <p>
          He shuddered at the thought, feeling the cold, creeping dread of the
          Abyss still lingering on his skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          He himself had witnessed the creatures of Abyss, albeit for a very
          short moment, but all of them were extremely repulsive and
          deadly.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          Their twisted forms and piercing gazes haunted his thoughts, leaving
          him with a deep-seated revulsion that he couldn't shake off.
        </p>
        <p>He was not able to sleep well for some days due to nightmares.</p>
        <p>
          He could understand that she must have seen something similar instead
          of his humane self.
        </p>
        <p>
          He realized the fear she must have felt, seeing him as one of those
          grotesque beings rather than the guy she knew.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those grotesque beings served him a reminder of the Abyss he now
          belonged to.
        </p>
        <p>It was no wonder she recoiled...</p>
        <p>
          He looked at her and activated [Cosmic Void Gaze], looking at her
          seriously, as if trying to suppress her with his aura alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes met hers, a palpable tension filled the air, as if the very
          fabric of reality trembled under the weight of his gaze
        </p>
        <p>
          The effect was instant as she slowly stopped struggling, and her eyes
          seemed to be gaining clarity back.&nbsp;
        </p>
        <p>
          The fog of confusion lifted slowly, replaced by a flicker of
          recognition and uncertainty.
        </p>

        <p>
          Oliver's eyes were an evolved version of hers, so naturally, he was
          able to do this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it was just a try, he did not expect it to work in first try,
          was this also associated with the Luck level?
        </p>
        <p>
          As Nadia slowly gained clarity, her eyes turned confused as she looked
          around and behind at the maid who was now holding her arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You guys! Be quiet and let me focus!" the elder shouted from the
          front as the haziness in her mind slowly cleared.
        </p>
        <p>
          She yanked her hand away, and the maid let her go after noticing the
          shift in her behavior.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew something strange had happened just now. At one instance, she
          was attacking him, and now after Oliver looked at her once, she calmed
          down.
        </p>
        <p>But she could not tell what…</p>
        <p>
          Nadia looked around, and confusion was visible on her face. What
          happened and why was she being held by the maid like this?
        </p>
        <p>She could not remember it.</p>
        <p>
          'What happened just now?' she strained her mind but could not recall.
        </p>
        <p>"Are you good?" A concerned voice sounded beside her.</p>
        <p>
          She turned her head around and looked at Oliver when a sharp pain
          assaulted her head as she started to remember the bits and pieces of
          the incident that had transpired just a moment prior.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at the sword thrown beside her, and there were droplets of
          red blood coating the shiny body of the weapon. The metallic scent of
          blood mixed within the fresh earthy air lingered near her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mood turned sour. Not only had she attacked him so suddenly like
          this despite him not doing anything, but she also showed such
          irrational behavior in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at him with a sullen face and distanced herself away,
          sitting in the corner opposite to him.
        </p>

        <p>
          A heavy silence enveloped them, she seemed to be feeling guilty, the
          weight of her regret could be felt through air.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed. Just earlier, he almost didn't see the sudden sword coming
          toward his head. Had his instincts not worked at the correct time, he
          could have suffered very serious injuries.
        </p>
        <p>It was his luck that he managed to avoid it.</p>
        <p>
          He secretly praised the power of level 4 Luck in his mind. He was
          lucky that his instincts and hands moved at the correct time to
          prevent a fatal injury.
        </p>
        <p>
          Luck or fate, he wasn't sure, but the narrow escape left his heart
          pounding in his chest, it was still beating wildly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at Nadia. He did not know what to do as he saw her glancing
          at him from time to time with a mix of wariness and curiosity evident
          in her expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was definitely wondering right now about what she saw and if it
          was right, then how was it possible, and all sorts of questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver refrained from talking to her for the moment since he did not
          have answers for her.
        </p>
        <p>Instead, he looked at his maid who was also observing him.</p>
        <p>'So she's strong enough to subdue Nadia without any problems.'</p>
        <p>Oliver knew he couldn't be careless with this maid.</p>
        <p>
          He was mostly conspicuous with his activities, but who knows when she
          might be watching him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder driving the car seemed to have not noticed the small
          commotion from before.
        </p>
        <p>Or even if he did, he intentionally ignored it.</p>
        <p>
          He looked at his clothes, and fortunately, they were not stained with
          blood, or else it would have put a bad impression on others
          considering this was his first meeting.
        </p>

        <p>
          The rest of the journey was in silence as Nadia did not speak, and
          Oliver, who did not want to be questioned, did not take the initiative
          either.
        </p>
        <p>
          The maid… well, she was quite interested in knowing what had happened
          and the reason why Nadia attacked him.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she was role-playing as a maid at the moment, and a mere maid was
          not in authority to know about things her master had not permitted her
          to ask.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was sure that something was amiss there. The always calm and
          composed genius Nadia would not suddenly attack someone like this,
          after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was also aware that she could not see them using special eyes
          on each other, and he did not intend to tell her either.
        </p>
        <p>"We're here."</p>
        <p>
          These words suddenly cut through the tension, drawing their focus to
          the windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder announced in a serene tone, prompting the attention of the
          occupants of the car.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver felt a small tremble as the car stopped.</p>
        <p>The maid was quick to react and opened the door for him.</p>
        <p>"Woah…"</p>
        <p>
          What he saw in front of him was a lush green forest—no, they were
          inside a dense green forest.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder who also got out said, "This is where the young heirs of the
          five clans will be meeting. This is a secluded sanctuary made by the
          clans. It is impossible to locate without prior information. Not only
          that, this sanctuary is protected by a powerful barrier."
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder pointed at the towering ancient trees and the lush greenery
          as he further added, "This place is quite old and not used as much as
          it used to be before. The clans shifted their meeting locations long
          ago, but it still exists and used to be the place where powerful
          exorcists of the past would meet and discuss important matters."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at the trees, and they did seem quite ancient. They were
          tall and almost covering his view of the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So this place serves as a neutral spot for the clans?" he questioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's right. Although it is now not the official meeting place
          anymore, it is still regularly maintained by the guardian spirits."
        </p>
        <p>
          'Guardian spirits?' Oliver's ears perked up. He had heard of them
          before but did not expect this place to have them.
        </p>
        <p>"Now, follow me. I will be leading you to the meeting spot."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but feel excited as he walked behind... it was
          finally time to meet them.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 99: Meeting the main-protagonist for the first time!</h2>
        <p>"Now, follow me. I will be leading you to the meeting spot."</p>
        <p>
          The trio followed behind the elder as he took some turns, and in a few
          minutes, they could finally see the place.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was like the heart of this forest, a clearing surrounded by the
          towering trees whose intertwined branches formed a natural canopy
          above.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air felt charged with an ancient energy, as if the forest itself
          was alive and watching them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ancient-looking stones carved with runes of unknown origin were placed
          strategically, forming a round table and chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further behind the table, they could also see moss-covered altars and
          statues, remnants of the past when this place was used frequently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's eyes were drawn towards the table and chairs. It was a
          gathering grove.
        </p>
        <p>
          The soft glow of bioluminescent flora and the melodic chirping of
          unseen birds gave the atmosphere a touch of tranquility and peace.
        </p>
        <p>
          His eyes wandered as he spotted others already seated around the
          table.
        </p>
        <p>'So we're the last to arrive.'</p>
        <p>
          He noticed the respective elders who had brought the heirs with them
          in the corner.
        </p>
        <p>'The meeting is not simple.'</p>
        <p>
          He knew this beforehand. First of all, there was the main goal of the
          meeting, which was some joint training program.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was said that due to the demons' increasing activities, they wanted
          to quickly nurture the talents in the younger generation and produce
          more powerhouses for the future war.
        </p>
        <p>
          They all knew that the war was going to happen sooner or later. There
          was no stopping it, and this war was going to be more violent than the
          previous one.
        </p>

        <p>
          So they decided that it was best to prepare their talented youths
          faster.
        </p>
        <p>
          But Oliver knew that for the meeting to happen so suddenly, the other
          clans must be curious about the void cloud phenomenon that happened
          some time ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          The elder must have come here in order to make deals for information
          or clarify matters.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at Nadia from the corner of his eye as she was also looking
          at the other children with an emotionless gaze.
        </p>
        <p>She walked up to the gathering grove as he followed behind her.</p>
        <p>He could feel all the gazes on him and her.</p>
        <p>"Hey?"</p>
        <p>
          He waved at the other children since he didn't know how to interact
          with them for the first time. They all had varying personalities.
        </p>
        <p>He soon received a curt response.</p>
        <p>
          First was a guy with short dark blue hair and blue eyes. He put a hand
          over his chest as he greeted back.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good morning, Sir Oliver. I am Alphonso Jadesins from the Fallen
          Heart Clan. You can call me Alphonso."
        </p>
        <p>
          His tone was polite, and his behavior was proper like a noble. He was
          taught well and had good etiquette, not to mention he was dressed in a
          formal suit for this meeting.
        </p>
        <p>"Pleased to meet you. You can call me Oliver too!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver also told him. Since the other party was willing to have
          informal relations with him, who was he to reject?
        </p>
        <p>
          He couldn't help but compare this little gentleman to a thoughtful
          scholar.
        </p>
        <p>
          He then heard another voice. This time it was a kid dressed in a
          simple shirt and pants, "I am from Sacred Swords Clan. You can call me
          Daniel."
        </p>
        <p>Oliver glanced at the boy and noticed his features.</p>

        <p>
          His body was notably sleek. He had shoulder-length, wavy hair of black
          color. His droopy eyes were the color of golden jewels.
        </p>
        <p>He nodded and also told him to be informal with him.</p>
        <p>
          Afterwards, it was a girl with narrow eyes of olive green color. She
          had long ankle-length, apple-green hair, her physique was athletic,
          and she had a pouting mouth.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am Amber from the Blue Crown Clan," she briefly said, somewhat
          coming off as aloof.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not mind. He could understand that she might be awkward
          with others.
        </p>
        <p>He gave her a reassuring smile, hoping to ease her discomfort.</p>
        <p>And finally…</p>
        <p>His gaze automatically went towards the last occupants.</p>
        <p>What a coincidence it was that the other party was also twins.</p>
        <p>
          His eyes focused sharply as he observed one of the two girls in front
          of him.
        </p>
        <p>'The protagonist has finally appeared…'</p>
        <p>
          His heart pumped blood in excitement. He was finally meeting the main
          protagonist of this world!
        </p>
        <p>He was face-to-face with her!</p>
        <p>
          "Greetings! I am Bella, and here's my little sister Evelyn! We're from
          the Celestial Paradox Clan!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl introduced herself and her little sister. She had platinum
          blonde hair falling to her shoulders like a cascading waterfall and a
          very confident aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          The lady reminded him of the famous character he had read in the
          novel.
        </p>
        <p>He knew her by her nickname from the novel.</p>

        <p>The unstoppable machine!</p>
        <p>
          She had slanted gray eyes that were like two silver coins. Her fine,
          wavy, alabaster hair was medium-length, and she wore a hairpin that
          was not actually a hairpin but a destructive artifact disguised as a
          hairpin.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had a cream-colored healthy skin tone and a tall, athletic build.
          She was the tallest in the group of children too.
        </p>
        <p>Of course, she was not the main protagonist.</p>
        <p>Her little sister was.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was immediately drawn to her, considering her radiant
          appearance and features.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her long golden locks cascaded down her back like streams of sunlight,
          each strand catching the light and radiating with a brilliance that
          seemed holy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her hair danced around her like a halo, framing her delicate features
          with an ethereal glow.
        </p>
        <p>But…</p>
        <p>It was her eyes…</p>
        <p>
          It was her eyes that truly caught everyone's attention. Her eyes were
          a shade of velvet, like the color of a deep, velvety rose in full
          bloom.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were glowing with an inner light, a warm aura surrounding her.
        </p>
        <p>It was as if her very soul radiated purity and strength</p>
        <p>
          It was those same eyes that drew demons to her like moths to a flame
          only to perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coupled with her golden hair, she truly had the main-protagonist aura
          to her.
        </p>
        <p>An attractive appearance like any other protagonist.</p>
        <p>
          She had a healthy, milky white skin tone and was dressed in a coat of
          midnight blue over a pristine white shirt. She looked like an
          aristocrat.
        </p>
        <p>Despite her tender age, she had the air of an elegant lady.</p>
        <p>A beacon of light in a world consumed by darkness…</p>
        <p>'Haha…'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but feel extremely excited. No matter what, he
          was going to bond with her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was the main protagonist who had yet to achieve considerable
          strength. There was no way he was going to miss this opportunity.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 100: Alphonso's doubt</h2>
        <p>
          Looking at the awkward girl, he couldn't help but think about the
          childhood of the protagonist mentioned in the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was a normal rich heiress in her childhood and lived in the shadow
          of her big sister, always behind her back.
        </p>
        <p>
          But all it took was a devastating incident, and everything changed for
          her forever.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main reason why she bore the unlimited hatred towards demons
          rooted from that incident.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed and shook his head. Looking at the excited yet stoic faces
          of the children, he knew half of them would not be the same in the
          future.
        </p>
        <p>"Oliver, right?"</p>
        <p>The elder sister of the protagonist, named Bella, called out.</p>
        <p>"Yes, Miss Bella?"</p>
        <p>
          "Ah, you don't need to use titles with me or my sister. You can talk
          to us normally too. We are here to get to know each other after all,"
          she said.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nodded, "Alright, I will call you Bella from now on and…" he
          looked at the quiet girl, "Evelyn."
        </p>
        <p>The girl turned her head and looked at him.</p>
        <p>
          As he saw her staring at him with those red eyes, he could not help
          but tremble slightly. For some reason, those red eyes were quite
          intimidating.
        </p>

        <p>
          'She should have awakened her special eyes already, huh. What a pity.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver knew the talent of the protagonist was extraordinary. He could
          feel an intensity behind that stare.
        </p>
        <p>"Right, right."</p>
        <p>
          Bella nodded. She was quite sociable and asked others to do the same.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver also helped Nadia to get acquainted although she barely said a
          word and kept her indifferent expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So, do you have any idea what's with this sudden meeting? I heard it
          was for some joint training program or something," Bella asked
          everyone, wanting to lighten the atmosphere and make everyone
          comfortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not help but nod. This was a true extrovert, eager to get
          comfortable with others and take charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I heard the same. I am not aware of the sudden reason behind it. The
          elders of my clan suddenly summoned me," Alphonso also informed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Daniel placed his hands on the table as he pondered, "If I had to
          guess, it might be related to the recent increased activity of demons
          at the borders."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That sounds about right," Oliver added. He noticed that Daniel was
          carrying a sword dangling by his waist.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Too simple," Amber casually said, much to Daniel's displeasure as his
          brows furrowed a bit.
        </p>
        <p>"What?" he questioned, looking at her.</p>
        <p>
          Amber, however, ignored him and looked at Oliver and Nadia with a deep
          gaze as she asked, "Your clan recently had an anomalous phenomenon,
          right? What was it about?" she questioned with a sly smile.
        </p>

        <p>
          'The others did not know about this. It seems that she got the
          information from her clan.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at her thoughtfully. He had to phrase his words in a way
          that didn't give any confidential information out, lest he got
          reprimanded by the elder later.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It was actually—" Just as he started to explain, he heard a loud
          banging sound from a corner.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          "Are you ignoring me!?" Daniel asked in a slightly louder tone as his
          eyes locked onto Amber, and his hand, which had turned into a fist,
          was placed on the table.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmph." Amber scoffed and turned towards him, "Did I ask you?"</p>
        <p>
          "OH? You…? I don't really fight with women, but you're provoking me,"
          he spat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Umm, calm down, you two," Oliver tried to maintain the peace, but…
        </p>
        <p>
          "You don't fight with women? Why? Are you scared of getting beaten?"
          Amber taunted him, further pushing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You! I can handle you even with my hands tied, haha. I am scared of
          none."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Really? I am sure I can put you in your place even with my eyes
          closed."
        </p>
        <p>The argument was slowly getting out of hand.</p>
        <p>"Remember, guys, we are here to get to know each other…"</p>

        <p>
          He tried to speak, but his voice only got drowned out by their loud
          heated talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned to Bella and saw her serious eyes. She stood up, and he
          thought that she was finally going to be a true leader who calmed the
          crowd.
        </p>
        <p>"How about a duel then?" she suddenly said.</p>
        <p>
          The two stopped and looked at her at the same time and asked, "Duel?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She smiled and replied, "That's right. Instead, how about we all duel
          with each other? Isn't it a great way to connect and familiarize
          ourselves with each other? We can develop a strong bond too by knowing
          each other's skills!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver stood up and said in a hurried tone, "Hey, hey, what are you
          saying? Why all of us? Just let these two fight it out."
        </p>
        <p>
          He suddenly felt a little regretful. She was indeed the unstoppable
          machine; he should have predicted this outcome given her nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry, Oliver," Bella looked at him, "It's going to be a
          friendly match."
        </p>
        <p>
          She paused for a moment and thought of something, "If you are worried,
          then we can ask one of the elders to oversee. I believe they will be
          good to judge."
        </p>
        <p>
          "But why exaggerate—" Once again, he got cut off in the middle of his
          sentence when Alphonso interrupted with a comment.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I do not mind. I believe we noble exorcists must recognize each
          other's skills if we truly intend to get to know each other." He
          looked at others before adding, "We will be the future of our clans
          and humanity at the same time. Someone weak would only drag us down.
          Of course, I am not implying that any of you here is weak. Neither am
          I trying to disrespect your respective clans. However, personally, I
          will never believe someone whose skills have not been seen by me."
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at Oliver as he said this. It seemed that he doubted
          Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ever since he had arrived here, he had seen others come one by one.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't tell this to anyone, but he was carrying an artifact with
          him that helped him measure the strength—overall esper—of those around
          him to some degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          The artifact buzzed constantly in the presence of the two girls from
          the Celestial Paradox Clan, informing him of their superior strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was able to acknowledge them through this alone and their clan's
          reputation.
        </p>
        <p>
          So was the case with the other two clans as well, so he had no
          problems whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had always been a person who did thorough research on both his
          allies and enemies beforehand.
        </p>
        <p>And there was a reason why he was feeling doubtful...</p>
