        <h2>Chapter 241 - Freedom? Love for Demons?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 241</p>
        <p>
          Their captain, Captain Sera, was present in the town. He only needed
          to convey to her once he found the human invader; she would take care
          of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't doubt that the human invader was weaker than her; otherwise,
          he would not have needed to hide in this city.
        </p>
        <p>
          'The nerve… a human defiling our land,'&nbsp;he muttered to himself. A
          vein popper on his calm face.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm, this is quite the predicament…"</p>
        <p>
          Vasoth paid little attention to Drul's death. To him, there was no
          particular relationship between them, nor were there any benefits to
          be shared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Indeed, Drul's death came as a shock to him, but that was the extent
          of it—a momentary shock.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced at the corpse with mild distaste. 'A waste of talent,' he
          thought, but nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>
          "S-Sir Inquisitor, this…" the merchant anxiously asked as he looked at
          the lifeless, tortured body of the other Inquisitor. He could now
          understand things subtly; this whole event to execute human slaves out
          of the blue, followed by this sudden death of an Inquisitor.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear the Inquisitors were likely trying to find someone in the
          city.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that someone was dangerous. To have killed an Inquisitor so boldly
          and thrown their body to a crowd was a daring move.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was obvious the person was strong, given how brutally they had
          finished Drul. But what was more shocking was their boldness—killing
          an Inquisitor was a serious offense against demons.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Inquisitors served directly under the Lords of Demons, and acting
          against them was akin to rebelling against a Demon Lord; such an act
          would bring severe consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Inquisitors were not feared for nothing. In fact, most demons
          would sooner betray their own kin than risk crossing one. Looking at
          Vasoth's calm face, the merchant could tell that Drul's death didn't
          faze him much.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demons in the crowd were whispering loudly, slowly and discreetly
          scattering. They all knew that a bloody battle could break out at any
          moment, and in the fights of the strong, weaklings were the first to
          perish.
        </p>
        <p>
          The merchant was sweating bullets. He wanted to leave as quickly as
          the others but didn't dare to in Vasoth's presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Such chaos over one corpse,' he thought, irritated by the crowd's
          sudden weakness.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It looks like the rat hunt will have to pause for now. The rat is not
          a rat, it seems," Vasoth said clearly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't look at the slaves and left directly. All the demons present
          were shocked.
        </p>
        <p>Wasn't this cowardly? Was the great Inquisitor scared?</p>
        <p>
          Otherwise, why would he leave in such a hurry? Leaving behind the
          livestock and abandoning everything in the middle.
        </p>
        <p>The merchant felt even more fear.</p>
        <p>
          He, too, looked at the slaves but suddenly didn't want to order his
          subordinates to drag them back.
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, this entire ordeal had started with these slaves. Drul's
          corpse was a chilling reminder of the consequences. Drul's corpse was
          still fresh, a direct warning to them.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was shameful to be so fearful of an unknown person, but he valued
          his life more. Even Vasoth, an Inquisitor, had left without saying
          anything, so no one could blame him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, no one would dare say anything to Vasoth's face either.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Wrap up! Everyone, go back to your homes. Sir Vasoth had something
          urgent come up," the merchant announced without explaining further.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the demons, who appeared to be the master of one of the human
          slaves, asked from the crowd, "Can I take my slave back?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The merchant halted, looked to see who had asked, then replied coldly,
          "Scram!"
        </p>
        <p>
          There was reluctance among the demons in the crowd, unhappy to leave
          behind the slaves they had bought. But despite their unwillingness, no
          one voiced much objection.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image of Drul's brutally tortured corpse was still fresh in their
          minds, even after his body had been taken away by the guard demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fear had cemented itself in the atmosphere, gripping the crowd like an
          iron chain. No one wanted to suffer such a fate, so one by one, they
          all left, abandoning the confused slaves.
        </p>
        <p>
          The black-haired girl was also released by the guards, who shoved her
          away.
        </p>
        <p>
          She stumbled forward but managed to balance herself. Her purple eyes
          reflected hatred for the demons, but at the same time, there was
          another emotion not present before.
        </p>
        <p>It was admiration and desire.</p>
        <p>
          She had witnessed everything, from the moment the Inquisitor's body
          was sent flying at Vasoth to the point where Vasoth was forced to
          leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          This feeling of victory, even though it did not belong to her, made
          her chest swell with heat. She felt tears in her eyes as she watched
          the demons who had always tortured them leave in fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the mysterious person not showing his face for even a moment,
          all the demons present were afraid of him. His presence lingered in
          the air like an invisible shield over the slaves. Even the mighty
          Inquisitors, who were thought to be undefeatable, had been brought
          down by this person.
        </p>
        <p>
          Such strength made her desire the freedom she dreamed of daily even
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were people strong enough to kill these Inquisitors. She wanted
          to be like that, too.
        </p>

        <p>
          She wanted similar strength to protect herself and her kin, to protect
          herself, and to eradicate all demons from this world.
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked around, hoping to catch sight of the mysterious person, but
          to no avail; all she saw were empty rooftops.
        </p>
        <p>
          She clenched her fists and looked back at the other slaves, all of
          whom were in a state of confusion and anxiety, uncertain of what would
          happen to them now.
        </p>
        <p>
          They didn't know where to go, as all the demons—their owners—had
          abandoned them alone in the city square. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>"W-What do we do now?"</p>
        <p>"I don't know…! We're all alone in this place!"</p>
        <p>
          "C-Could it be some sort of trick? To l-leave us alone and then
          suddenly kill us…?"
        </p>
        <p>"I w-want to go back… My master left me alone… Where do I go?"</p>
        <p>
          These slaves, whose mental states were fragile after enduring
          prolonged torture, were having panic attacks. They didn't know where
          to go, fearing they might be killed if they tried to leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their wills had been broken. Most of them had lost the strength to
          think independently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though they had been tortured and treated harshly, they seemed to
          want to return to the way things were.
        </p>
        <p>
          The chains may have fallen from their bodies, but not from their
          minds.
        </p>
        <p>Stockholm Syndrome.</p>
        <p>They were all suffering from this condition severely.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 242 &nbsp;Was there really no way?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 242</p>
        <p>Stockholm Syndrome.</p>
        <p>All of them were suffering severely from this condition.</p>
        <p>
          Even though the demons had abused them their entire lives, they still
          wanted to return to them, even now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The thought alone made her stomach twist. How could they want to go
          back? To willingly step into the chains that had held them down,
          crushed them, torn them apart piece by piece…
        </p>
        <p>
          "WHY? Just WHY?" a crazed slave muttered while biting his fingernails.
          His fingers were gnawed down to the quick, raw and red, trembling as
          he chewed on them with a strange desperation. "Why would someone
          interfere!? Maybe my… my master would have taken me away if only
          everything hadn't been interrupted…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearing this, a few other slaves had a strange glint in their eyes.
          "Right… m-my owner would never abandon me…" n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          "M-My mistress too, s-she is often strict but a-at least I-I could
          still live…"
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at the scene, the black-haired girl felt a surge of anger. A
          hot, pulsing wave, rising from her gut to her throat until her chest
          felt tight. How could they think like this? Even when their lives had
          been spared from the butcher, they were still blaming the mysterious
          person.
        </p>
        <p>Were they even in their right minds?</p>

        <p>
          Her jaw clenched tightly. She could feel her teeth grinding together,
          and a dull ache was building along her jaw. All of them were adults,
          yet she couldn't understand why they were acting this way.
        </p>
        <p>Shouldn't this be the time for them to plan their escape?</p>
        <p>
          It was a golden opportunity to leave this accursed land forever and
          find somewhere safer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Somewhere without the demons' shadow looming over every sunrise, where
          they could breathe without fear.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't know where it would be safe, and she wasn't even sure if
          such a place existed for them, but one thing she knew for certain was
          that they had to leave quickly before the demons returned.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if possible, she wanted to find that mysterious person who had
          saved them. She believed that if they grouped together with him, they
          might truly be safe from the demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          But… the others weren't even thinking straight. Their eyes were
          glazed, as if they were looking at something far away, something only
          they could see. She gritted her teeth and spoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stop arguing and blaming the savior! If not for that person, we all
          would have been beheaded. We need to get out of here quickly before
          the demons return!"
        </p>
        <p>The arguing slaves paused and looked at the young girl.</p>
        <p>"E-Escape? I-I wouldn't dare… no."</p>
        <p>"Right… we cannot leave… where would we even go…?"</p>
        <p>
          "Humanity has abandoned us anyway. We might as well go back to our
          owner…"
        </p>
        <p>"Y-You're right… I… I'll go back too…"</p>

        <p>
          Many others voiced agreement, and the girl's expression turned to
          disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was like watching drowning people refuse the hand reaching to pull
          them to shore, choosing the darkness below instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          She couldn't understand why they would want to return to their cruel
          lives, even after being given a chance to escape.
        </p>
        <p>No, she had to stop them.</p>
        <p>
          "What are you all saying!? Why are you trying to go back? Let's
          leave!"
        </p>
        <p>
          She ran up to an elderly woman and tried pulling her back to prevent
          her from leaving.
        </p>
        <p>
          "L-Let go of me!" the woman screamed hysterically and pushed the girl
          away with force.
        </p>
        <p>Crash!</p>
        <p>
          The ground rushed up to meet her, and she landed hard, gravel biting
          into her knees and palms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl was thrown back by the force, falling and scraping her knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ouch!" she groaned in pain as she looked down at her knees, which
          were now scratched and bleeding from the rough texture of the road.
        </p>
        <p>
          Blood welled up, bright against the dirt, stinging as it trickled down
          her legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The slaves didn't even bother to look back and began running to their
          places, to their demonic owners.
        </p>

        <p>
          She was discarded. No one listened to her; no one cared about her. It
          was as if her voice was nothing more than a breeze, swept away without
          a second thought. She tried to get up but stumbled forward in pain.
          Her knees were hurt and bleeding now.
        </p>
        <p>
          She gathered her courage and tried to support herself against a nearby
          wooden crate.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rough wood dug into her palms, but she held on, feeling the
          splinters bite into her skin as if the pain could anchor her in this
          nightmare.
        </p>
        <p>
          A few slaves still remained who, unlike the others, hesitated. She
          closed her eyes and calmed her mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the silence, she forced herself to breathe, each breath shallow and
          quick, her chest tight with the weight of everything unsaid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Opening her eyes, she glanced at the others and asked in a low yet
          somewhat hopeful voice, "Well… since you didn't go back, that must
          mean you also want to escape, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          They looked at each other, their faces filled with fear and
          hesitation. One woman clutched her arms around herself, her shoulders
          hunched as if trying to make herself smaller, less visible. Another
          young man kept glancing over his shoulder, flinching at every distant
          noise. It was clear they, too, were contemplating whether to return or
          not.
        </p>
        <p>But the cruel days of torture held them back.</p>
        <p>"H-How do we get out of here?"</p>
        <p>A boy in his late teens asked the others.</p>
        <p>
          "S-Should we just run toward the north gate? I heard there are the
          fewest guards there," someone suggested.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, I overheard my mistress say on the way here that the city has
          been sealed on the Inquisitor's orders."
        </p>
        <p>"W-What…? What do we do now!?"</p>
        <p>Panic spread among the remaining few slaves.</p>
        <p>
          "N-No… I'm going back too… it's hopeless…" One of them broke down and
          ran back in a hurry.
        </p>
        <p>
          The black-haired girl swallowed hard, her throat dry as sand. "Huff…"
          She rubbed her thigh, trying to soothe the pain. She had expected this
          to some extent.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt too tired to stop them from leaving, she knew there was not
          much she could do.
        </p>
        <p>
          A bitter laugh echoed in her mind. Here they were, given a chance at
          freedom, and they were too afraid to take it. Was this what the demons
          had reduced them to?
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 243 - Oliver but something is different?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 243</p>
        <p>
          'Should we attack the demons? No… Impossible; we'd be captured without
          mercy.'
        </p>
        <p>
          'Then… maybe steal weapons and kill the guards.' Her eyes narrowed, a
          fierce glint flashing through them as she imagined it—a desperate,
          brutal fight for freedom, no matter the cost. She had already made up
          her mind that to survive, they must be ruthless toward their enemies.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the problem was that they couldn't compete with specially trained
          guards, and there was no guarantee the other demons would stand by and
          watch.
        </p>
        <p>
          She didn't know what to do in such a situation. Her mind raced, but
          every plan seemed like a dead end, another trap waiting to snap shut.
          There were six of them left, but where could they even go? Almost
          every corner had demons. Wherever they went, they would be devoured.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Is there really no way out?' She sighed internally, lamenting the
          situation. Even though they'd been given a chance, they were helpless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her legs were injured, and she could barely balance herself, let alone
          attack the demons. She wasn't even sure if she could run away.
        </p>
        <p>
          If, in the end, the demons returned and captured her and the others,
          it would truly be the biggest waste of an opportunity.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Maybe they'll starve me to death…' She wondered what sort of
          treatment awaited her once she was taken back. The thought left a
          bitter taste in her mouth, and she clenched her fists, nails digging
          into her palms as if the pain could keep her focused.
        </p>
        <p>
          'If that's how it was going to be… why did they even bother leaving us
          here? Did they already know we'd go back on our own? Was this their
          attempt to completely crush our spirits?'
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked down at the ground, her eyes feeling warm for some reason.
          Her vision blurred, the edges softening as something hot prickled
          against her lashes. She quickly wiped at her face, smearing dirt
          across her cheek.
        </p>
        <p>It was then that a voice suddenly sounded.</p>
        <p>"Only you six are remaining? What a shame."</p>

        <p>
          A magnetic voice echoed in the quiet city square, instantly attracting
          the attention of all six of them!
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl's head snapped up, her heart pounding as she scanned the
          darkness. She looked up and saw a figure slightly taller than herself,
          cloaked in dark robes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deep blue eyes, visible from beneath the hood, stared at them
          scrutinizingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Even after going through all that trouble, only six of you had the
          courage? How lame."
        </p>
        <p>
          The girl's breath caught, her chest tightening. Those eyes seemed to
          pierce straight through her, cold and calculating. Her eyes widened,
          and she hastily asked, "A-Are you the one who… did that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The man turned his gaze toward her, and she felt a chill run through
          her as she looked into those cold blue eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Indeed, if that's what you're referring to," he nodded.</p>
        <p>
          "Ah…" The girl's face went blank. A mix of awe and fear settled over
          her, and for a moment, she forgot the pain in her knees, forgot the
          hopelessness that had weighed her down just moments ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          "W-Wait, why did you come only now!? All the others have gone back to
          the demons! How are we going to get them back!?" one of the remaining
          six slaves exclaimed in shock.
        </p>
        <p>"Get them back?" The man asked in confusion. "Who said that?"</p>
        <p>
          "I'm not responsible for them. If they choose to go back, that's their
          decision. To me, they're useless baggage—the less, the better," he
          said with a dark laugh. His voice held a detached amusement, as if the
          lives of those who'd returned meant nothing more to him than discarded
          trash.
        </p>
        <p>
          "W-What are you saying…? Aren't y-you part of reinforcements from
          Humanity?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Reinforcements? Ah, there was something like that, yes. But I'm not
          part of it. I'm a solo traveler." He tilted his head slightly as he
          explained.
        </p>
        <p>"B-But how could you do that…? Aren't you human?"</p>

        <p>
          "Everyone, stop it!" the girl exclaimed loudly, interrupting the
          others. Her voice shook, but her eyes were steady.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Be grateful that this person came to save us. Those who have left
          have already been corrupted by the demons. Taking them along would
          only add to his responsibilities." n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          She spoke firmly. "He has no obligation to help us. He could leave us
          alone in this place. Are you confident enough to fight and survive
          against the demons? Right now, we must stick together and follow what
          he has planned for us."
        </p>
        <p>
          The man raised an eyebrow, though his expression remained hidden under
          the cloak. Internally, he looked at her with interest, noting that she
          was the youngest of the group and yet possessed such courage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking into her eyes, he sensed the dominant spirit within her; she
          hadn't yet been broken by the demons.
        </p>
        <p>"What's your name?" he asked.</p>
        <p>
          "I-I don't have a name…" she stammered, her cheeks flushing with a mix
          of shame and defiance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Forget it, then. All of you who want to escape, follow me. I believe
          you've all made up your minds, haven't you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned around, his cloak fluttering slightly in the chilly wind as
          he continued, "Of course, those of you who are afraid, don't bother. I
          won't protect you much. You'll be on your own. So, if you're willing
          to risk it, follow me."
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, he entered the nearest alleyway, waiting for them to follow
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We must do this… it's the same in both cases. Even if we return,
          there's no guarantee we won't be killed or that our treatment would
          get any better. This is the first and last chance to escape. Even if
          it costs our lives, we should risk it now."
        </p>
        <p>
          The black-haired girl got up, trembling, her knees shaking, but her
          eyes filled with determination. Pain shot through her legs as she
          moved, but she gritted her teeth, willing herself to ignore it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I will follow him. The rest is up to you; I can only persuade so
          much. We're humans and should cooperate when we can."
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear from her words that she valued her race and kin deeply.
          She was persuading them for the sake of their shared humanity. She
          knew she couldn't let her kin suffer any longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, she limped and dragged herself toward where the man was
          waiting. Every step was agony, her knees burning, but she refused to
          slow down.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, another person followed her, then another, and then two
          more.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h2>Chapter 244 &nbsp;Sera's disappointment! The sudden summon?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 244</p>
        <p>
          Just like that, all six of them began following him through the narrow
          alleyway. The smell of the gutter was strong and overwhelming; it was
          evident that this was where the city's waste tunnels were connected.
        </p>
        <p>
          The black-haired girl instinctively wrinkled her nose as she did her
          best to keep up with the others. The foul air seemed to cling to her
          skin, seeping into her clothes and hair. The stench was suffocating—a
          sickly blend of rot and decay that clung to the back of her throat.
          Her young age, coupled with her knee injury, made it difficult, but
          she remained silent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gritting her teeth, she pressed forward, her mind fixed on the thought
          of freedom, even if it lay at the end of a dark, foul-smelling alley.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was clearly trying not to be a burden on anyone. Every step sent a
          sharp jolt of pain through her knee, but she forced herself to keep
          moving, her jaw clenched tightly against the discomfort. One could
          tell she had matured well beyond her years under harsh circumstances.
          Her breathing was heavy as she grew tired, but the group didn't stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pain was relentless, flaring with each step until her legs felt
          like they would buckle beneath her.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wanted to ask if they could pause for a second so she could catch
          her breath, but she was afraid that Oliver, who was ahead, would
          ignore her and leave her behind, abandoning her.
        </p>
        <p>The other slaves were too occupied to pay attention to her.</p>
        <p>
          The group mostly consisted of teenagers, with the only exceptions
          being a man in his mid-twenties and a woman in her 30s.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huff… Huff…" Her breaths were coming in ragged gasps now, each one
          catching in her chest. Her eyes felt partially blurry as she kept
          walking. The stench from the surroundings was making her dizzy, and
          the pain was increasing with every step.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her rags were drenched in sweat, and her steps felt heavier and
          heavier as her eyes opened and closed intermittently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each time her eyes drifted shut, she struggled to force them open
          again, her vision swimming as exhaustion clawed at her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Slowly, darkness covered her vision as she fell forward onto the
          ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, before she could hit the ground, a hand caught her, lifting
          her entire body up. The grip was firm, almost gentle, and for a moment
          she felt as if she were floating, as if the pain had faded to nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          She could only hear muffled sounds; the last words she heard were:
        </p>
        <p>"Such a stubborn girl, just like her."</p>
        <p>And with that, she fainted.</p>
        <p>______________</p>
        <p>In a luxurious room somewhere.</p>
        <p>"I am incompetent, Captain. Please punish me as you deem fit."</p>
        <p>
          Vasoth was kneeling on a carpeted floor. In front of him was a chair,
          and seated on the chair was Sera.
        </p>
        <p>
          The room was lavish, with dark velvet drapes and polished mahogany
          furniture, a stark contrast to the harshness of their conversation.
          Sera's expression at that moment was extremely cold and dangerous.
        </p>

        <p>Her eyes barely suppressed the murderous intent raging inside.</p>
        <p>Drul was dead.</p>
        <p>
          And the killer was still unknown; they did not even know his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth had planned foolish stunts behind her back and had failed
          miserably, further ruining the reputation of the Inquisitors.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, they had achieved nothing but loss since they had arrived in
          this city.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was nothing noteworthy about them. Vasoth had run away cowardly
          when he saw Drul's lifeless body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Vasoth… you have successfully ruined our reputation. How do you
          feel?" she questioned in a stern voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          The silence that followed was heavy, oppressive. Vasoth lowered his
          head, his face pale, beads of sweat collecting at his temples. He was
          wiser; he remained silent rather than risking anything more.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Once we return to headquarters, we will proceed with your
          punishment," she said, her tone still harsh.
        </p>
        <p>"For now, identifying and finding the culprit comes first."</p>
        <p>
          "Mobilize all the forces present in the city to find him… no matter
          what," she continued. "We have the city lord's approval to use his
          forces. Do not disappoint me anymore, Vasoth."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, ma'am." Vasoth bowed even further. His hands clenched into fists
          at his sides, his jaw tight with suppressed anger. He felt angry and
          humiliated; because of one human, he was being berated and punished.
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite Drul's body being thrown at his feet, he had still been unable
          to sense that human. It was certain the human had been very close at
          that time, yet his exceptional senses had detected nothing.
        </p>
        <p>The thought gnawed at him, a constant itch he couldn't ignore.</p>
        <p>
          Just what sort of technique was the human using to hide himself?
          Whatever it was, Vasoth had to find it. It was an extremely risky
          variable. The family he belonged to was known for their exceptional
          detection senses, and if humans had managed to develop a way to evade
          those senses, it would be a huge setback for the demons in the wars.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to find the human, make him reveal the secret, and then
          promptly develop countermeasures, no matter what.
        </p>
        <p>As he was contemplating, a knock sounded on the door.</p>
        <p>Sera frowned; she had clearly instructed not to be disturbed.</p>
        <p>"Enter," she said.</p>
        <p>
          A young demon entered the room, dressed in the city's official guard
          uniform, with a rough air about him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guard bowed quickly, though his eyes darted nervously between
          Vasoth and Sera, sensing the tension.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Miss Sera, the city lord urgently wants to meet you and Sir Vasoth.
          It's a matter of utmost importance," the guard said.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A matter of utmost importance? What is it about?" she questioned.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am afraid only the city lord can tell you that. He has asked me to
          escort you both to him as soon as possible; he seemed distressed."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera's eyes narrowed slightly. She thought for a moment before
          nodding. "Alright, show the way."
        </p>
        <p>The guard saluted and gestured for them to follow.</p>
        <p>
          Sera and Vasoth followed after the guard and were soon led to the City
          Lord's Office.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera was currently staying as a guest in the city lord's castle, so it
          did not take long to reach her destination.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guard knocked twice on the door, and a crisp sound was heard from
          inside.
        </p>
        <p>"Let them in."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 245 &nbsp;It was erased!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 245</p>
        <p>
          "Please…" The guard bowed, opened the door, and gestured for them to
          enter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera walked in, maintaining her graceful yet commanding posture. Her
          chin was lifted slightly, a cool confidence radiating from her as if
          she owned the very air around her. Her heels clicked sharply against
          the polished floor, each step precise and controlled, like a blade
          slicing through the air. The clicking of her white boots echoed
          clearly as she moved.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth followed closely behind her, curious as to why the city lord
          had summoned them so suddenly.
        </p>
        <p>
          A faint prickle of anxiety crept up his spine, cold and insistent. His
          stomach twisted with a vague sense of dread. Whatever this was, it
          couldn't be good.
        </p>
        <p>
          Two desolate eyes stared at them as soon as they entered. Vasoth
          narrowed his eyes, observing the lord of this city.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fanged mouth exhaled dark mist, and four thick horns adorned his
          rugged head, which was etched with fiery symbols. Forked nostrils
          flared within his curved nose.
        </p>
        <p>
          A robust, tall body leaned against the window of the room, covered in
          armor from head to toe. The armor gleamed in the dim light, each plate
          etched with intricate demonic runes that seemed to pulse faintly, as
          if alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demonic man stepped closer to them, his legs easily carrying his
          diabolical form. His boots hit the ground with a heavy, rhythmic thud,
          each step exuding authority.
        </p>
        <p>He completely ignored Vasoth, his gaze fixed on Sera's calm eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "Miss Sera, I presume you are already aware of what your subordinates
          did?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed. He will be punished accordingly once we return to
          headquarters," she replied, not losing her composure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether her subordinate had committed a mistake or not, the matter of
          punishment was up to her and the higher-ups. She needed to maintain
          her position in front of others.
        </p>

        <p>
          "I certainly do hope for that. But…" The demon turned around, his back
          facing the two inquisitors as he continued, "the reason I have called
          you here is not that, but something else."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera's gaze sharpened, her eyes narrowing ever so slightly "What is it
          about, then?"
        </p>
        <p>
          A burst of dark aura erupted from the city lord's body, instantly
          filling the room with terrifying pressure. The force pressed down on
          Vasoth, nearly forcing him to his knees.
        </p>
        <p>
          It felt like a mountain had dropped onto his shoulders, the weight
          pressing down on his chest until he could hardly breathe. It was
          overbearing, as if a mountain was weighing down on his shoulders;
          however, the next moment, the pressure ceased to affect him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked up to see an equally ominous and powerful energy field
          surrounding him. He recognized it at a glance as the captain's aura.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Incredible… this is the captain's aura… such density, such power.
          This suffocation… it's as if I'm standing next to a draconic beast.'
        </p>
        <p>
          Draconic beasts, descendants of dragons, were known for their
          terrifying aura. To be compared to one in terms of aura was high
          praise.
        </p>
        <p>
          'But to think the city lord was this strong…' Vasoth's gaze narrowed.
          His eyes flicked between Sera and the city lord, assessing,
          calculating. The city lord's strength was no joke either. To withstand
          the captain's energy was shocking. Although he was being shielded by
          Sera, the city lord was clearly formidable.
        </p>
        <p>
          "City Lord, are you rebelling against the demon lords?" Sera asked in
          a threatening tone.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haha… HAHAHAHA!" The city lord burst into maniacal laughter, making
          Sera frown. The laughter reverberated through the room, low and
          menacing, each note tinged with something dark and unhinged.
        </p>
        <p>"What's so funny?" she asked sternly.</p>
        <p>
          "Funny? What's funny? YOU DON'T KNOW?" He shouted, his eyes bloodshot
          with rage.
        </p>
        <p>"Calm down and explain." Sera remained unfazed.</p>
        <p>
          To her, losing composure was weakness—a flaw she had trained herself
          to purge long ago. Losing composure was immature, in her opinion,
          especially for a city lord.
        </p>
        <p>
          "…The western region of the city," the city lord took a deep breath
          and continued, "it's been wiped out."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wiped out?" Sera raised a brow, confused by the meaning behind his
          words.
        </p>

        <p>"All demons in the western region have been killed."</p>
        <p>
          "Impossible!" Vasoth shouted in horror, his eyes widening, a chill
          spreading through his veins.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was also where he last sensed Drul going. If what the city lord
          said was true, then the one behind this was…
        </p>
        <p>Sera was silent, not saying anything.</p>
        <p>This was indeed a shocking matter—a grave matter.</p>
        <p>
          "All demons are dead? Is that…" she hesitated, "…really the case?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The city lord's face twisted, his expression a mix of rage and
          despair. "Haah…" The city lord rubbed his swollen temples, gently
          scratching his horn.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's true. I received the report from the northern guards who went to
          inspect. Every single demon—and by that, I mean every single demon, be
          it a guard, merchant, or civilian—all of them were found dead."
        </p>
        <p>
          A shudder ran through Vasoth, and he clenched his fists, trying to
          process the enormity of it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A pool of blood filled the western streets. It was a brutal and
          humiliating sight." The city lord's teeth cracked in anger.
        </p>
        <p>"My wife… she too was killed." He finally said it.</p>
        <p>
          Sera closed her eyes. A slight crease appeared between her brows, the
          only sign of her inner thoughts. It looked like things had gone way
          out of hand. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>
          She had to step in now. There were no excuses for their incompetence.
          They were in this city for a mission; although it wasn't directly
          related, the security and order of the city naturally fell under the
          Inquisitors' purview whenever they visited.
        </p>
        <p>
          If she didn't find the culprit now, it would escalate into a major
          issue at headquarters, especially for those eyeing her ambitious rise
          in the hierarchy.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Could it be a scheme?' She didn't dismiss the possibility. She had
          numerous enemies who wanted nothing but her downfall, so it wasn't
          impossible that they would act in such a way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her mind raced, calculating potential threats, forming contingencies,
          but she kept her face calm and unreadable.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How was the entire western region of the city murdered overnight
          without anyone realizing it? At least one demon should have been able
          to escape. Aren't you partly responsible for this situation? Where
          were your guards? I'm sure your wife must have been a strong demon
          too." Vasoth chimed in, forming a hypothesis.
        </p>
        <p>
          He tried to keep his voice steady, but there was an edge of doubt.
        </p>
        <p>_______________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 246 &nbsp;What is she thinking?</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 246</p>
        <p>
          He tried to keep his voice steady, but there was an edge of doubt, of
          disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter what, it sounded too absurd for a single human to do it
          without alerting anyone. The very idea gnawed at him—an entire region
          wiped out, and yet no one had noticed until it was too late. He didn't
          want to believe that this was done by the human but rather that it was
          some kind of ploy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haha… you brat, you think I don't know what you mean? Grow your horn
          first before suspecting me. It's my city, and all demons here are my
          subjects. I won't sacrifice my kin for useless schemes," the city lord
          growled, his voice low and dangerous.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera stepped forward. The air around her seemed to sharpen, a cold,
          dangerous edge in her stance. "I will handle this matter personally
          from now on. I assure you that the culprit will be presented before
          you shortly."
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth's eyes widened slightly, a flicker of surprise breaking through
          his usual stoic expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera's words came as a shock to Vasoth. For their captain to step up
          was very rare, but the situation was also serious, so he remained
          silent.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Captain!" He managed to contain his astonishment, but inside, he felt
          a pang of shame. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>A single human was not worth his captain's attention at all.</p>
        <p>
          How badly had they failed if their captain herself was forced to
          intervene?
        </p>

        <p>
          Despite being cunning and scheming, he and Drul, along with all her
          other subordinates, were extremely loyal to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demons followed the law of strength, loyal to those stronger and in
          awe of those with capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          Vasoth was on Sera's side and always made plans in her favor, to
          elevate her above others. Even back at headquarters, he had always
          been cautious of everyone, keeping his captain's reputation above
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          But this time, so much had happened that their captain was forced to
          come in person to take action.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt even more ashamed than before. The bitter taste of failure
          lingered in his mouth, stoking a fierce resentment for the human who
          had forced them into this situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          If something happened and the human caused even more danger, then the
          people back at headquarters would attack Sera brutally with this
          excuse and try to restrict her as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>He had never felt more hatred for a human than at this moment.</p>
        <p>
          The thought filled him with cold dread. Sera was not only his captain
          but his ally in a world where loyalty was rare. He could not allow her
          to fall because of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, everything would be over soon. Sera was not like them, after
          all.
        </p>
        <p>
          The city lord waved his claw in a dismissive motion. "Do what you
          must. I want the culprit behind this whole situation, dead or alive.
          Let me witness the power of the infamous Black Lotus."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sera didn't reply but turned around and left. She should have acted as
          soon as she was informed of the intruder in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
          She hadn't expected it to turn into such a huge matter now. Even one
          of her subordinates was killed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Her jaw clenched as anger simmered beneath her calm exterior. Her eyes
          darkened as she parted her lips, an enchanting yet threatening smirk
          forming on her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          'A single human… it's been a while since someone so interesting has
          appeared.'
        </p>
        <p>
          The sound of her heels clicking against the rugged road echoed; the
          thrill of the hunt stirred something fierce and exhilarating within
          her.
        </p>
        <p>'A human I was not able to sense…'</p>
        <p>
          She looked at the yellow, dusty sky, feeling a surge of excitement in
          her veins. The sky seemed to mirror her mood, casting a dim, hazy
          light over the city as if preparing for a storm.
        </p>
        <p>"Vasoth," Sera called to him, her back facing him.</p>
        <p>"Yes, captain?"</p>
        <p>"You said you left those human slaves at the city square?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, captain. I left those livestock there only." A brief hesitation
          flickered in his eyes as he asked, unsure, "…Was I supposed to take
          them with me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          He asked the last sentence in a low tone, wondering if leaving the
          slaves there was a mistake. Perhaps they could have threatened the
          human by holding them hostage?
        </p>
        <p>
          After all, it was known that those human rebels in the demon lands
          usually went after the captured ones, aside from other nefarious acts.
        </p>
        <p>
          He considered them nothing more than mere livestock, and what he did
          was logical. People like them were not weak enough to need
          hostages—especially not their captain.
        </p>

        <p>But maybe the situation required them to settle this quickly?</p>
        <p>"No," Sera shook her head, a smile on her face.</p>
        <p>"What you did was right."</p>
        <p>
          She whispered as a glint flashed through her cold eyes. It was a
          calculating look, a gleam of anticipation that Vasoth rarely saw.
        </p>
        <p>"He will fall for it," she said. "After all, he is a human."</p>
        <p>"Prepare the troops, we are going to clean a lot of pests soon."</p>
        <p>
          "Pardon?" Vasoth asked. But Sera said nothing more, a mysterious
          expression on her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, neither of them realized that the human they were after had
          already left the city.
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>Outside the city…</p>
        <p>Oliver was sitting on a piece of rock.</p>
        <p>He had already left the city along with the group of slaves.</p>
        <p>
          The city gates now lay far behind him, the distant silhouette of the
          walls barely visible in the misty morning light. He had incapacitated
          the guards at the city gate and forced their way out.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, he was sitting across from a makeshift campfire with a few pieces
          of sleeping cloth laid out in the open, where the other six who had
          left with him were resting.
        </p>
        <p>
          They had, of course, looted the guards at the city exit, ransacking
          everything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Coins, food, and scraps of armor lay scattered around the camp,
          hastily gathered trophies of their escape.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't want to share his belongings in the space artifact with
          them, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after rescuing them, he didn't have any solid plans for them. His
          gaze flicked over the sleeping forms, his mind already calculating his
          next move.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 247 &nbsp;The memory!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 247</p>
        <p>
          It was then that he remembered the existence of secret human
          reinforcement hideouts spread across the demon lands.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he didn't remember exactly where they were, but fortunately
          for him and the others, the older man among the six knew about the
          place from his time spent with other captives who were now dead.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had barely managed to survive among the demons and was quite
          resilient. With Oliver's extensive knowledge and the man's awareness
          of the terrain, it didn't take them long to guess where the
          reinforcement hideout would most likely be.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't an exact location, but Oliver felt it was close enough; once
          they reached nearby, he could find it on his own.
        </p>
        <p>
          He stretched his legs out toward the fire, feeling the warmth seep
          into his weary muscles, easing the tension that had settled into his
          bones. His purpose in the city was already fulfilled, and staying any
          longer would have only brought trouble.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had caused permanent damage to the city, and if he guessed
          correctly, everything should be in chaos at this moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          A faint smirk tugged at the corner of his mouth, his eyes reflecting
          the dancing flames as he pictured the confusion and terror his actions
          would have left behind. Memories of the past flashed through his mind
          as he recalled the time when he had just finished dealing with Gureon
          and her goons.
        </p>
        <p>He reminisced about what happened afterward.</p>
        <p>____________</p>

        <p>Few days ago…</p>
        <p>"Phew. It was quite the work."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver wiped the sweat from his brow, his hands slick with the blood
          of demons. The stench clung to him, metallic and foul, but he hardly
          noticed anymore. He wiped off his sweat after finishing with all the
          hearts he had extracted from the demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a long and atrocious process, but he felt pretty numb to the
          fact that he had eaten hearts. What would have once horrified him now
          felt like routine. The inner sense of disgust had reduced
          significantly by now.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now that the main obstacle has been cleared…" His expression darkened
          as he continued, "It's time to clear the side quests."
        </p>
        <p>
          Gureon controlled the west, and there were plenty of demons living in
          this place.
        </p>
        <p>More demons, more hearts…</p>
        <p>
          A sinister smile crept across his face, sharp and unsettling. Oliver
          subconsciously broke into a sinister smile; he didn't realize it, but
          something was affecting him.
        </p>
        <p>Something darker and more sinister was influencing him…</p>
        <p>
          It was unclear whether it was a change he should be cautious of or
          whether he should welcome it.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hours that followed were filled with intense slaughter, a
          one-sided massacre where demons were butchered left and right without
          mercy by a single entity.
        </p>
        <p>
          He moved through the streets like a shadow, silent and unstoppable,
          his every step trailing a wake of death. His presence was
          undetectable, even to the best of the best or the most sensitive of
          beings. It was like a ghost killing everything in its path, with
          nothing able to stop it.
        </p>

        <p>
          What was even more terrifying was that the demons themselves did not
          realize they were slowly being killed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He swept over the whole region like a storm, leaving nothing but blood
          and silence in his wake. A bloody mist penetrated the very air in the
          area as he continued dismantling them.
        </p>
        <p>
          His hands were bloodied by the time he stopped, and his clothes were
          drenched in the vile blood of the demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          He took a deep breath, his mind dizzy from the aftermath. The coppery
          tang of blood filled his nostrils, and his heart pounded in his chest,
          but he felt… nothing. Just a hollow calm. He didn't know when he had
          become so numb to killing, but he felt nothing more than a slight
          sense of disgust.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe it was because of how he had been brought up in this world that
          his mind had adapted to the cruelty and killing, now normalized in his
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          He glanced into his mind space and saw a heap of hearts stacked like a
          pile of grass lying there.
        </p>
        <p>But…</p>
        <p>
          He looked around, his gaze sweeping over the empty, blood-soaked
          streets. Looking at his desolate surroundings, he wondered if any
          demon was even left alive.
        </p>
        <p>
          The streets were littered with the bodies of countless demons, the
          shops filled with the corpses of their owners and customers.
        </p>
        <p>
          A thick, cloying silence hung in the air, broken only by the faint
          drip of blood pooling in the gutters. Everything had happened so
          quickly. Those demons were weak and didn't put up much resistance
          against his onslaught.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't discriminate and attacked every demon, young or old, undead
          or alive; even the skeletons were destroyed by him.
        </p>
        <p>"Huff…" n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om</p>

        <p>
          "Huff…" He exhaled heavily, sliding down to sit against a nearby
          container, his body finally relaxing after the hours of relentless
          slaughter. It had not been easy. He would not have been able to do it
          if the region hadn't been relatively small and easier to navigate.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had attacked the guards first, and as a result, the remaining
          civilians were left extremely unorganized and chaotic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using abyss energy while hunting them down was extremely effective;
          all of them went down as if they were carrots waiting to be pulled
          out.
        </p>
        <p>It was probably then that he came across this area…</p>
        <p>Drul… the demon inquisitor.</p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>Drul's POV</p>
        <p>"What happened to this place?"</p>
        <p>
          Drul stared in disbelief at the streets littered with demon corpses,
          blood painting the ground and walls, bones scattered everywhere. The
          metallic scent of blood and decay filled the air, thick enough to
          taste. It was a horrendously chilling scene.
        </p>
        <p>'What sort of monster has done this?'</p>
        <p>
          Drul couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart as he looked at the
          insane rampage and brutal slaughter. His lips curled into a twisted
          smirk, and despite himself, he felt a thrill race down his spine.
        </p>
        <p>
          The feeling of danger, the thrill of being close to a predator—it was
          intoxicating to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          A jolt of pleasure ran through his demonic body, his feet moving on
          their own toward the area despite the obvious signs of danger.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just what sort of inhuman monster must have committed such a massacre?
        </p>
        <p>It was absolutely insane.</p>
        <p>'He has to be at least as much of a maniac as our captain.'</p>
        <p>
          He knew who was behind this carnage, it couldn't be anyone else, his
          sharp nose was telling him this.
        </p>
        <p>________________________</p>

        <h2>Chapter 248 &nbsp;Drul found him!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 248</p>
        <p>
          Drul had a foreboding feeling that this was done by the same human who
          had trespassed into their city through teleportation.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had wandered to this area of the city on a whim after separating
          from Vasoth at the city center.
        </p>
        <p>
          But as he entered, the atmosphere was completely different; it was
          eerily silent and cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          The usual bustling noise of the city had vanished, replaced by an
          oppressive quiet that clung to everything like a heavy shroud. The
          silence pressed down on him, thick and unnatural, as if even the air
          itself was holding its breath. It was almost as if he had mistakenly
          walked into a graveyard, not a regular city area.
        </p>
        <p>'Not only that but…'</p>
        <p>
          He glanced at one corpse, then another, and another; all of them had
          deep, gaping holes in their chests where their hearts should have
          been.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dark, dried blood stained the ground beneath each body, forming a
          grotesque path of carnage. 'The human has been collecting their
          hearts. But why?' Drul thought silently.
        </p>
        <p>He could not understand why the human would do that.</p>
        <p>
          For alchemy? There wasn't much that could be done with a demon's
          heart.
        </p>

        <p>
          For a ritual? It was possible, but for him to collect so many hearts
          at once… it only meant one thing.
        </p>
        <p>The human was likely planning something big and dangerous.</p>
        <p>
          He was internally shocked by how swiftly this had happened, with even
          the guards nearby unaware that something like this had occurred right
          behind their backs.
        </p>
        <p>
          His claws flexed instinctively, the anticipation building in his
          chest. He had never expected to stumble upon such a scene.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It looks like I won't need Vasoth to draw out the human; the prey has
          willingly come to me."
        </p>
        <p>
          A gleeful grin spread across his face, his bright yellow eyes
          narrowing with excitement. He licked his fangs in anticipation,
          feeling the thrill of the hunt coursing through his veins. It was an
          obvious signal of the deadly game that was about to begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking up, his eyes met the sky… With a sharp inhale, he amplified
          his senses, letting the scents and sounds of the world sharpen in his
          mind. His senses amplified as all scents in the world became familiar
          to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Found you." Drul let out a feral grin as he leaped high into the sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          His speed was tremendous as he ignored everything in the distance and
          reached the place where Oliver was.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There you are, human!" Drul bellowed joyfully as he looked at the
          cloaked figure below. n/ô/vel/b//jn dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>It was definitely the human; he could tell despite the cloak.</p>
        <p>
          The human had tried to mask his scent with mud and leaves, but it was
          a weak attempt, laughable to someone with Drul's heightened senses. It
          was almost as if this was the first time the human had come to the
          demon lands. Not only that, but the human was definitely inexperienced
          and young.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was almost as if this was the first time the human had come to the
          demon lands. Not only that, but the human was definitely inexperienced
          and young.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since he had found the human before Vasoth, he didn't need to care
          about what Vasoth wanted. He could do whatever he pleased now.
        </p>
        <p>_____________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver glanced up at the demon; it was the same inquisitor who had
          interrupted Sera when she was about to touch him at the abandoned
          temple.
        </p>
        <p>
          From that brief experience and the demon's willingness to reveal
          himself by shouting now, he concluded that this demon had a hot temper
          and more muscle than brains.
        </p>
        <p>
          An impulsive, brutal opponent—easy to manipulate but dangerous if
          underestimated.
        </p>
        <p>A foolish yet brutal enemy.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver stood up; he had rested enough. This inquisitor seemed brutal,
          and the evident hatred in his eyes was palpable.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could almost feel the demon's malice radiating toward him, thick
          and suffocating like poison.
        </p>
        <p>A cruel and dangerous demon.</p>
        <p>
          Not that it mattered—whatever the demon was after had nothing to do
          with him. Since the demon was here to kill him, he wouldn't hold back
          either.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hearts of common demons were already stocked in his mindspace, and
          he wouldn't mind adding a potent one.
        </p>
        <p>
          A strange hunger stirred within him, a craving for the power that
          would come from devouring this demon's heart. His body craved it… the
          power he would gain by devouring Drul's heart… he could hardly wait.
        </p>

        <p>
          "How did you find me?" Oliver asked, his childish voice now audible.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You see, I have a keen sense of smell. But…" Drul paused and looked
          at him with narrowed eyes. The gleam in his eyes was unsettling, a
          predatory intensity that made Oliver's skin crawl. "How old are you?
          Your real age."
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm… why do you want to know that?" Oliver asked back.</p>
        <p>
          "My scent tells me you're a kid, but the skills you've shown don't
          seem to belong to a child," Drul said with a smile, though the smile
          didn't reach his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"You have a sharp nose," Oliver acknowledged.</p>
        <p>
          "Then that means…" Drul frowned, his expression darkening as he
          processed the information.
        </p>
        <p>"You really are a kid."</p>
        <p>
          "Indeed, I should be around nine this year," Oliver replied
          uncertainly; his birthday hadn't been celebrated, and he didn't care
          much, so it was only a rough guess.
        </p>
        <p>Maybe the clan directory would have the exact figure recorded.</p>
        <p>
          In this world of exorcism, people aimed for immortality, so birthdays
          weren't often celebrated unless they marked a milestone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, this was only valid for exorcists; normal humans still
          celebrated every year. Their lives were shorter, and they cherished
          each one.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a way, normal humans were happier than many exorcists with their
          monotonous lives of meditation and combat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Impossible," Drul said calmly. "A mere kid can't use such advanced
          stealth techniques."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then why did you even ask?" Oliver felt exasperated. Why would the
          demon ask if he didn't want to believe him?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shall we begin?" Drul ignored Oliver's exasperation and asked with a
          menacing grin, his claws flexing in anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>"No," Oliver replied.</p>
        <p>"It doesn't matter what you say! HAHAHA!"</p>
        <p>Drul lunged from the ledge he was standing on toward Oliver.</p>

        <h2>Chapter 249 &nbsp;The fight!</h2>
        <p></p>
        <p>Chapter 249</p>
        <p>
          "TAKE THIS!" His fist morphed into sharp silver claws as he slashed at
          Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>
          A cloud of dust rose as Drul clenched his fist, but there was nothing
          left but rugged ground where Oliver had been standing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul's eyes narrowed, a flash of irritation darkening his face as he
          realized he'd missed his mark. He turned to see that Oliver had
          already moved some distance away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Human, why struggle? You're about to become my prey. Just stay still
          and take my punch."
        </p>
        <p>Drul showed his sharp teeth, his yellow eyes shining brightly.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver met his gaze, and for a split second, he felt a strange
          dizziness wash over him. His vision blurred momentarily, as if the
          yellow, sandy eyes were swirling in his consciousness.
        </p>
        <p>He felt those eyes invading his mind.</p>
        <p>
          A cold, insidious presence seemed to seep into his thoughts, as though
          Drul were trying to sink hooks into his very soul. Drul recognized the
          opportunity and seized it.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          Drul's iron-tough fist slammed into Oliver's gut, the force blasting
          through him like a sledgehammer. The impact threw him back, crashing
          him into the wall behind. n/ô/vel/b//in dot c//om
        </p>
        <p>The wall cracked from the impact.</p>

        <p>
          "Ugh-!" Oliver gritted his teeth, his body shaking from the force. A
          sharp pain radiated through his ribs, each breath sending a fiery ache
          through his chest. He felt the blow directly in his ribs, as if they
          had cracked from the force.
        </p>
        <p>The strength of this demon was terrifying.</p>
        <p>
          If he let himself be hit a few more times, he might not be able to
          endure it.
        </p>
        <p>And something was even more concerning than that brute strength.</p>
        <p>
          It was those yellow eyes. They were not average eyes. While not one of
          the four special types, they held a lower-level ability; there were
          many eye techniques and unique bloodlines, and this demon inquisitor
          clearly had a special one.
        </p>
        <p>The eyes seemed to possess properties of hypnosis or obstruction.</p>
        <p>
          "You're tough for a kid," Drul said, tilting his head with a creepy
          expression, his lips stretching into a grin that showed far too many
          teeth.
        </p>
        <p>A sword appeared in Oliver's hand.</p>
        <p>
          "A sword? Well, it won't change anything. Let's see how long it lasts
          against my fists."
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul's figure blurred as he appeared before Oliver, his hand moving
          forward as Oliver raised his sword to block the incoming strike.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>
          The clang echoed sharply as Drul's fist collided with the metal blade,
          the force of the impact reverberating through Oliver's arm. Despite
          the sword being made of tough metal, it rang as Drul's fist collided
          with it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul was definitely fast and strong—a proper mid-level demon—while
          Oliver had only just entered Rank-2.
        </p>
        <p>
          And unlike heretics with fake strength, Drul wielded true potent dark
          espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even from a single punch, Oliver could feel dark espera seeping into
          his body, trying to consume his pure espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          A cold, sickly energy slithered through his veins, threatening to
          corrupt him from the inside. He channeled his own espera and purified
          it within.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Usually, one punch is enough to corrupt an exorcist. But you… you did
          nothing but flinch slightly," Drul said in a quiet voice, his eyes
          gleaming with a dark curiosity.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Moreover, I sense little espera in you, but the traces of my dark
          espera were completely erased just now. You're clearly hiding your
          true power, but what irks me is that…"
        </p>
        <p>Drul paused dramatically, locking eyes with Oliver in a frenzy.</p>
        <p>"…I can't sense its depth."</p>
        <p>
          Although Drul's voice was calm and sober, his expression was filled
          with intense rage, his bloodshot eyes wide, his sharp teeth visible.
        </p>
        <p>A pulsing black energy enveloped both his arms.</p>
        <p>
          Sensing the energy, Oliver frowned, feeling an odd disgust. It was as
          if something holy had been rolled in dirt and sewage, tainting its
          purity.
        </p>
        <p>'Is this what exorcists feel when facing demons?'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver grinned and said, "If you can't sense my espera, then that
          means you're only so-so."
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite knowing that Abyss energy was potent enough to evade even
          Ophelia's perception, he taunted Drul just to enrage him further.
        </p>
        <p>The words had an immediate effect on his enemy.</p>
        <p>
          Drul snarled, his face twisting with fury, and in an instant, he
          almost vanished from sight, reappearing inches from Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>
        <p>Bang!</p>

        <p>One punch after another rained down on Oliver.</p>
        <p>
          But Oliver countered them all, his sword moving in a flowing
          pattern—from right to left, up and down—blocking from every angle.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each strike sent shockwaves up his arms, the relentless force of
          Drul's blows threatening to shake the sword right out of his grip.
          Despite his rage, Drul aimed for precise points, constantly targeting
          Oliver's vitals. Dark espera was leaking more and more from Drul's
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air grew thick with malevolent energy, a suffocating darkness
          pressing down on everything around them.
        </p>
        <p>Holy Flames of Nightmare</p>
        <p>
          Just as Drul was pushing Oliver back, a torrent of pitch-black flames
          engulfed Oliver's sword, causing Drul to instinctively jerk back at
          the sudden burst of heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver didn't miss the demon's momentary lapse and lunged forward,
          slashing at Drul's face.
        </p>
        <p>"Bastard!"</p>
        <p>
          Drul roared as the flames burned him, his dark espera corroded by
          those strange flames.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite the flames' ominous appearance, they seemed to hold an element
          of holiness—corroding his body and dark espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          A sizzling sound filled the air, and Drul's skin bubbled and blistered
          where the flames touched. He hissed in agony, his face contorted in
          rage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul recognized the danger. He had never encountered flames like these
          before. The mysterious origins of this human boy… He had to kill this
          kid before he grew stronger and became a threat to the demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Drul's demeanor shifted, his eyes swirling faster as he fixed his gaze
          on Oliver.
        </p>
        <p>'Again? You think I'm easy to push around?'</p>
        <p>
          But Oliver was ready this time. He felt slightly ashamed for having
          been affected by such a low-level eye technique before.
        </p>
        <p>[Cosmic Void Gaze]</p>
        <p>Oliver stared directly back into Drul's yellow, sandy eyes.</p>
        <p>
          "Ack!" Drul instantly shut his eyes, clutching his head as if in
          intense pain.
