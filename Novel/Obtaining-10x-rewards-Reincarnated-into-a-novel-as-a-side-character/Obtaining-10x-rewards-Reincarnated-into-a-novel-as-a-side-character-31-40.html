        <h2>Chapter 31: Nadia was suspected?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 31</p>
        <p>"Did I allow you to leave?"</p>
        <p>A cold voice sounded from behind him.</p>
        <p>'Fuck...'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver's back was drenched in cold sweat as he realized what was going
          on.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was using her espera to lock him in his place, and since he had
          almost close to none espera, he was unable to feel the flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately for him, she was using a minimal amount of force so as not
          to crush him by accident.
        </p>
        <p>"What do you want?"</p>
        <p>
          He could not help but ask involuntarily, wanting to know the accursed
          reason why she was stopping him from leaving.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do I want now?" She leaned on her desk, holding her chin in her
          hand as she observed his back.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm..."</p>
        <p>
          To be honest, she was not sure herself about what she wanted from him
          either.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was more like an intuition of sorts of hers... it told her that she
          should not let Oliver leave.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had been in the world of business for many decades; she had a very
          sharp intuition whenever it came to deals that generated massive
          profits.
        </p>
        <p>
          And right now, it had been tingling in Oliver's presence since he
          entered the room, but it became excessive when he casually took out
          the [Medal of Eternal Pain] so she just stopped him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She frowned when she could not think of a proper response. This made
          her a little irritated, given his small age and childish bearing; she
          was unsure of what to ask for. It was not often that she felt
          troubled.
        </p>
        <p>She could not keep him here for long either.</p>

        <p>
          This was a young master from the main lineage of the clan; no matter
          how useless he was, he shared their reputation and name even if he had
          an insignificant contribution.
        </p>
        <p>There would be complications if he kept him here for no reason.</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly her eyes lit up, as she tapped on her desk slightly and
          Oliver's body moved on its own as he came face to face in front of
          her.
        </p>
        <p>
          They both looked into each other's eyes, Oliver felt she was quite
          beautiful but she was a devil so he didn't care.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman also felt that Oliver's features were quite delicate and
          cute, especially his eyes; for some reason, they seemed to draw her
          towards them with a mysterious charm.
        </p>
        <p>'Does he have some sort of special eyes?'</p>
        <p>
          She made a wild guess, that would explain to her how he was able to
          sort out artifacts from the trash.
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, she was quite immune to charm and mind-affecting
          techniques, but she felt a strong force of attraction to his eyes
          which made her feel she had guessed correctly.
        </p>
        <p>Or maybe he had a special constitution...</p>
        <p>
          'As expected, he should be a perfect fit.' She thought of something
          and her eyes once again focused on him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her lips curled and she had an expression that made others feel that
          she was about to offer something great, she said,
        </p>
        <p>"Do you want to join the Black Codex Federation?"</p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>____________________________</p>
        <p>
          Far from the market in the central area of the clan was Nadia's
          courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the courtyard, there was a metal dummy placed; the metallic body
          resembled a human body.
        </p>
        <p>
          In front of the metal body, there she was standing with a calm
          expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          In her left hand, she was holding a long red rapier with a golden tip;
          it was an ordinary rapier but was made by a fine blacksmith.
        </p>
        <p>It was no artifact, just a slightly strong rapier to use.</p>

        <p>
          She looked at the metallic dummy with a serene expression, her eyes
          devoid of any emotion.
        </p>
        <p>She gripped the rapier's body and disappeared from her spot.</p>
        <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
        <p>
          A loud series of banging sounds were heard before Nadia reappeared on
          her spot.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was still holding the rapier, and nothing had changed on her
          expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, in the next moment, the metal dummy, which was intact just a
          moment ago, suddenly broke down into pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cuts were all made at weaker joints with fine precision and
          controlled strength showing her level of handling the weapon.
        </p>
        <p>She glanced at the broken dummy and then to her rapier.</p>
        <p>
          'I should be able to master this technique in a few weeks worth of
          time.'
        </p>
        <p>She thought and closed her eyes.</p>
        <p>
          This rapier technique was called [Press of the Liberty], and it was a
          powerful rapier technique that had the capability to pierce through
          tough metals and armors like paper.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was about to practice and revise another martial arts technique
          when she suddenly heard a small clap.
        </p>
        <p>Clap!</p>
        <p>She froze and looked behind her instantly...</p>
        <p>Behind her was the most terrifying existence she had ever known.</p>
        <p>Her mother...</p>
        <p>
          Ophelia had appeared behind Nadia without her noticing anything. It
          was unknown for how long she had been behind her, concealing her
          presence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia's eyes shone in a strange light as she met her mother's eyes.
          She unconsciously used her [Abyss Eyes] whenever in the presence of
          her mother—it just showed that her body felt uneasiness and
          instinctively used means to protect itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ophelia was wearing a white kimono with black design patterns; her
          graceful figure was properly emphasized by the dress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her silver eyes was as cold as usual; it was unknown what was on her
          mind. She did not care about her daughter using special eyes knowing
          it could not pose her a threat.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although she was clapping, there was not even a hint of happiness on
          her face. Her face, which resembled Nadia a lot, was a whole more
          expressionless.
        </p>
        <p>"Mother... since when..."</p>
        <p>
          Nadia said in a low voice, not bearing a hint of confidence she showed
          around others. At the same time, she also controlled herself and
          stopped using the special eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You have improved." Ophelia spoke a few words, but to Nadia's ears,
          it was the greatest praise. She did not even answer her question and
          directly ignored that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia lowered her head as she nodded a little; she felt happy that her
          mother acknowledged her growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver's face suddenly came to her mind, remembering the scene where
          he gave her the elixir, but she quickly shook away the thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia narrowed her eyes watching her daughter's antics. She felt
          that her daughter was showing too much emotion and that was not what
          she wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          But she decided to let it be for the time being; Nadia had improved
          significantly as compared to the last time in killing her emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was normal; she was a growing child and all sorts of emotions and
          feelings would course through her. It was good as long as she kept
          eliminating them as they appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia considered giving her special medicine to suppress the limbic
          system present in her brain.
        </p>
        <p>
          The limbic system in the human brain was responsible for regulating
          emotions.
        </p>
        <p>
          The medicine was something she had concocted herself; it limited the
          effects of the limbic system in the human brain specifically targeting
          the emotions while boosting the prefrontal cortex, which was
          responsible for decision-making.
        </p>
        <p>
          The medicine had little to no side-effects, and it helped improve the
          memory as well. It would improve the person's ability to take quick
          rational decisions in intense situations
        </p>
        <p>
          But she wanted to wait some more years before feeding it to Nadia
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia was still a child, and taking the medicine too much would reduce
          the benefits, if anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had already fed her the medicine once so she must wait for the
          second round.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ophelia's eyes shone in a silver light, just like Oliver's special
          eyes, unlike him, she possessed a special constitution and it was one
          of her abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that, she looked at Nadia. Her mastery over her eyes was far
          superior to Oliver's mastery.
        </p>
        <p>Oliver was nothing in front of her.</p>
        <p>
          One instant was all it took for Ophelia to analyze as her eyes
          narrowed once again.
        </p>
        <p>She noticed something abnormal about her daughter's body.</p>
        <p>
          She calmly looked at Nadia with a piercing gaze and then said in a
          cold voice...
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 32: Safe for now? Offered benefits?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 32</p>
        <p>
          "Punch that metal puppet with your full strength," Ophelia said, her
          tone more of a command as she looked at another metallic puppet in the
          courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia also followed the direction and directly went towards it without
          any question.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her fists clenched as she punched the metallic puppet with all her
          strength.
        </p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>Crack! Crack! Crack!</p>
        <p>
          In the next moment, cobweb-shaped cracks appeared on the ground where
          the puppet was standing just a second ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          In its place was now nothing but tiny broken pieces of what was left
          of the metal.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your physical strength has increased by a large margin unexpectedly,"
          Ophelia's calm voice sounded as she keenly observed her daughter who
          also looked at her expressionlessly, not saying anything.
        </p>
        <p>This sudden boost in her strength was out of her calculations.</p>
        <p>
          Was this really it? Was it really due to her talent that her strength
          had a boost?
        </p>
        <p>Or was it due to some other reason...?</p>

        <p>She felt suspicious.</p>
        <p>
          Nadia's heart stirred for some reason; she felt proud that her mother
          had acknowledged her improvement but she didn't know why but when her
          mother said the last line, she was asking her why?
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why won't I say that I received a body-strengthening elixir from
          him?' She asked herself this question.
        </p>
        <p>
          She felt that if she said that, something that she didn't want to
          happen would happen. Her mother would not sit still. The thought of
          what might happen made her heart clench suddenly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at her daughter being silent, Ophelia didn't ponder on it for
          the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nadia has always been obedient to her commands and would provide her
          with a detailed report of her actions every time.
        </p>
        <p>So if there was something, she would know.</p>
        <p>
          "I want you to be prepared. Your first demon hunt will be soon. All
          the heirs of the clan will be participating in the demon hunt, and I
          expect you to triumph over others," Ophelia said as a matter of fact.
          She made it clear that she would not accept anything but victory from
          her daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          The demon hunt was a competition of sorts which was part of the
          training regimen all the young heirs of the clan must go through.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were a total of 5 pairs of siblings in the main family as of the
          moment, and every single one of them would need to participate in
          that. It was mandatory.
        </p>
        <p>
          They must gain experience as they train so as to be prepared for the
          future war that could break out at any moment and not die early.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the clan would provide the children who perform
          excellently with some excellent rewards that could make anyone drool.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, mother," Nadia replied in a tone devoid of any warmth; she was
          just like an emotionless robot who followed her mother's commands and
          replied when asked to.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ophelia did not stay any longer, and in front of her daughter's eyes,
          her figure disappeared into thin air as if it was never there in the
          first place.
        </p>
        <p>"Do you want to join the Black Codex Federation?"</p>
        <p>These words dropped like a thunderbolt in Oliver's ears.</p>
        <p>
          He didn't hesitate and directly declined her offer in the next moment.
        </p>
        <p>"No."</p>
        <p>
          He didn't even need to think that this woman was plotting something
          devious and he was a part of her plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't like to be controlled like this and be a pawn in someone's
          plans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although being a true member of the Black Codex Federation was
          something exorcists would kill for.
        </p>
        <p>
          Joining the Black Codex Federation as a true member was extremely
          difficult, and only through invites from already present members could
          one enter the ranks of the Black Codex Federation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt like he was giving up too many benefits at the moment when
          he replied with a flat 'No', but he suppressed the feeling of loss.
        </p>
        <p>
          If he became involved with such a mysterious and powerful woman with
          unknown intentions, he wouldn't know how it would affect his life.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman who heard his instant rejection was stunned for a second
          before she asked.
        </p>
        <p>"You... are you aware what you declined? You must not, right?"</p>

        <p>
          She felt Oliver was being ridiculous, but considering his tender age
          and lack of knowledge, she felt that he was just being oblivious.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Black Codex Federation was an extremely influential organization
          with its influence on par with the top 5 clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          It had no lack of resources either for its members; artifacts one
          could only dream of or martial or exorcism techniques one had only
          heard legends of... everything was there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the unparalleled security the organization offered...
          half of your opponents would admit defeat if they knew you belonged to
          the Black Codex Federation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The organization was controlled by extremely powerful people rumored
          to be on par with elites of the top 5 clans.
        </p>
        <p>It was a superpower in its own league.</p>
        <p>
          "I know of the benefits; I have read various books about the
          organization, and I also know that you represent the organization, but
          I must decline the offer," Oliver refused with a bleeding heart.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman looked at the little boy in front of her; she felt even more
          stubborn now, she now wanted to get him even more. If she decided on
          something then there were few who could stop her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your clan treats you as air; your talents are not recognized by your
          own clan. You are forced to live isolated from others. Your existence
          is not known to many despite being one of the heirs."
        </p>
        <p>She put her hands down on her desk as she continued.</p>
        <p>
          "The Black Codex Federation will not neglect you like your clan. Your
          talents will be polished, and you will be far above from where you are
          currently. Not only that, you will have access to the organization's
          massive network and resources."
        </p>
        <p>
          "And you still refuse? What is there that is stopping you? Are you
          afraid that your clan won't leave you if they become aware of your
          change in affiliations? If so, you don't have to worry about that.
          Until you leave your clan boundaries, there will be nothing that could
          relate you to us. I can guarantee that."
        </p>
        <p>
          She paused for a moment and added, "After leaving your clan once, you
          can operate independently. If it's still not enough to convince you to
          join then what is?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman folded her arms and crossed her legs as she looked at Oliver
          with a strict gaze that wanted answers.
        </p>
        <p>He opened his mouth but no words came out.</p>
        <p>
          'Damn, she said so much... but all of this makes sense. She is so
          terrifying in negotiating...' He could not help but suck a cold breath
          of air to calm his mind.
        </p>
        <p>She was too strong!</p>
        <p>He calmed down and thought for a moment.</p>
        <p>'Joining the Black Codex Federation, if I...'</p>

        <h2>Chapter 33: Things become clear! Secret room!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 33</p>
        <p>
          'But looking at it from a wider perspective, joining the Black Codex
          Federation is not a bad option either. Although I will be risking
          becoming involved in her plans if I did join but will that even
          matter?'
        </p>
        <p>He seriously asked himself.</p>
        <p>
          'I have the system and could grow stronger than anyone else if I
          remain patient. Getting too concerned with my security is not optimal
          here... Plus she's right, the clan does not provide me with resources
          I should have...'
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver remembered how he had to beg for money and various permissions
          to enter the central area of the clan through maids.
        </p>
        <p>Even some maids were better treated than him.</p>
        <p>
          He felt that he was already strong enough physically and should be
          allowed resources that would be provided to an exorcist who has taken
          the physical exorcism path.
        </p>
        <p>
          He didn't have any weapon technique he could train, nor any martial
          art technique either. Neither did he have any espera techniques.
        </p>
        <p>He was really too miserable if not for the system.</p>
        <p>
          He had just purchased the [Six Thoughtful Steps of the Spirits] of his
          own money and it was just a movement technique for exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although now he finally had some cash but he knew it was temporary and
          all of it would most likely be used up in the auction.
        </p>
        <p>
          And finding artifacts that were treated as trash in the clan market
          was not easy at all. There were appraisers everywhere and hardly would
          they leave an artifact alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not as easy as it was depicted in the novels he used to read
          where the protagonist would keep finding artifacts every now and then.
        </p>

        <p>People of this world were not stupid.</p>
        <p>
          Looking at Oliver's hesitant face, the woman secretly exclaimed that
          he was too cautious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even after providing him with such strong arguments and benefits any
          exorcist would kill for, he still hesitated over his choice?
        </p>
        <p>She decided to give him a final push.</p>
        <p>
          "If you join right at the moment, I will allow you to choose a
          Rare-rank artifact for free."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver who was thinking about his life heard this and was stunned.
        </p>
        <p>He felt like he was hearing things...</p>
        <p>A Rare grade artifact for free?</p>
        <p>
          It was common knowledge to exorcists that artifacts also had grades
          that they were divided into.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was based on the power they possessed, their availability, their
          history if any, and some other factors.
        </p>
        <p>Artifacts were divided into 5 ranks in general.</p>
        <p>Common Artifacts</p>
        <p>Uncommon Artifacts</p>
        <p>Rare Artifacts</p>
        <p>Epic Artifacts</p>

        <p>Legendary Artifacts</p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>
          Common artifacts included basic weapons with enchantment, accessories
          with simple espera functions, or some cultural symbols.
        </p>
        <p>
          Uncommon artifacts were less common than common artifacts but still
          relatively accessible. These included specialized weapons, espera
          talismans and other special weapons. These artifacts were often
          related to history or had ties to being used by someone significant in
          the past.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rare Artifacts were highly sought after artifacts by exorcists. They
          possessed a great deal of power. Not only that they had significant
          historical importance in the world as well. These included powerful
          weapons with special abilities, relics with unique powers. Some of
          these artifacts even had ties to legendary or mythical creatures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Epic Artifacts were very rare to find. They were often legends that
          many had heard of but have not seen in person. Naturally they carried
          extraordinary amount of power and value, being capable of changing
          history of the world itself. These artifacts were had immense espera
          abilities, were tied to relics of ancient civilizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Legendary Artifacts were the most powerful and revered of all. They
          were the crown jewels of any collection, had god-like powers and
          importance.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one knew much about them, how they were born, some assumed they
          were forged by gods as relics of creation and destruction while other
          believed they were formed by natural world-altering events.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were no clue if there was any legendary artifact in the world or
          not, these artifacts could alter reality itself.
        </p>
        <p>________________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver heard that she was willing to give him a Rare rank artifact and
          was rather stunned.
        </p>
        <p>
          Did she really wanted him to join the organization so much? Or was it
          for everyone who joined the organization to receive an artifact or
          something else.
        </p>
        <p>
          One had to know that Rare rank artifacts were not easy to get hands
          onto, for reference, the [Medal of Eternal Pain] that he had sold to
          her before was an Epic rank artifact.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright, I will accept your invitation and join the Black Codex
          Federation."
        </p>
        <p>
          He decided to join the organization, in the novel, this organization
          was quite deep and had many mysteries. Not to mention there would be
          many events in the future where he could use his knowledge of the
          novel to extract enormous benefits.
        </p>

        <p>
          Not only that, he could also remain as a member of Mystic Purge Clan
          officially while also being a part of the Black Codex Federation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Black Codex Federation has played an important role in the world
          during many arcs, not to mention it also had a dark secret that he
          knew about...
        </p>
        <p>
          From his knowledge, he was sure that they would be more than happy to
          have a member that was also a part of the 5 great clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was akin to having a mole in another country's government at a high
          level, many decisions could be influenced.
        </p>
        <p>
          The woman who heard him felt quite happy inside, she had finally
          gotten what she wanted and was deeply satisfied by her victory.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure enough, she could make others bend to her will as long as she was
          rich, had many resources.
        </p>
        <p>But after calming down, she realized she was being too happy.</p>
        <p>
          She had to give him an artifact to convince him to join, who even does
          that!?
        </p>
        <p>
          People would beg just to be related to the organization and he was
          being like this?
        </p>
        <p>
          She scolded herself for being too hasty and now she felt that she
          might have looked desperate to him.
        </p>
        <p>
          She won't take back what she had said, she was a woman of her words.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shaking her head, she looked at the little boy in front of her who was
          also looking at her curiously.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I am Jenna. Jenna Sullivan and you will be under me from now on."
        </p>
        <p>
          She got up from her chair and Oliver got a view of her full body, she
          was lean and had proper curves of a lady. She had long legs and thick
          thighs whose appeal was enhanced by her outfit.
        </p>
        <p>"Follow me." She ordered and went up to the bookshelf.</p>
        <p>
          And under Oliver's excited gaze, she shifted one of the books and a
          secret passageway revealed itself from between the shelf.
        </p>
        <p>This was the dream life!</p>
        <p>
          Oliver had always wanted to experience something like this once in his
          previous life, entering through a secret tunnel located right beside
          him in ordinary places.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quickly followed after his new boss as he saw her enter the
          stairway.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, they reached the secret room and he was amazed by what he
          saw!
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 34: Choosing an artifact! Youngest to join?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 34</p>
        <p>
          The stairway was not too long and they both soon came into a room with
          black tiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver could not believe that there was such a space present in such a
          building and most likely this room was built using space manipulation
          using espera.
        </p>
        <p>
          He felt all of his senses were blocked in this room; he could not even
          feel Jenna who was right in front of his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Take any one of the artifacts present in that area. All of them are
          Rare-ranked artifacts," Jenna simply said and pointed to a corner of
          the room where a bunch of instruments were placed in an orderly manner
          with name tags underneath or beside them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver did not stand on ceremony and quickly went over to take a look
          and get an artifact for himself.
        </p>
        <p>"You have so many..." he could not help but say.</p>
        <p>
          Jenna, who heard his awe, crossed her hands under her chest as she
          said with a hint of arrogance, "Of course. Who do you think I am?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at her, Oliver suddenly felt that she seemed somewhat
          gullible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although she still had that aura of superiority and power around her,
          looking at her actions and listening to her words, he was not sure if
          she was gullible or he was a fool.
        </p>

        <p>
          Earlier, she offered him an artifact to join the Black Codex
          Federation, which made him feel she really wanted him there.
        </p>
        <p>But he could not understand why?</p>
        <p>Was it for his appraisal ability that she seemed to think he had?</p>
        <p>
          If so, then she shouldn't have been like this; he knew how many great
          artifact makers and experts were a part of the Black Codex Federation.
        </p>
        <p>He was just a little kid.</p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he had no clue about her from the novel, so it was
          likely that she was also some random side-character like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          A powerful side-character who belonged to a super organization but
          never met or interacted with the protagonists of the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          'And I also don't have an impressive espera either... I would say my
          espera is as low as that of a normal human.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought that there was no way that she sensed he had an abnormal
          espera for his tender age either since he didn't have any to boast and
          for her to sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          And although he had a great amount of physical strength, he had not
          done anything for her to know of it either.
        </p>
        <p>
          He knew that he would not receive the invitation to join such a big
          organization for no reason. There had to be a deeper reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          But since he had no clue about it, he was just rolling with the
          situation since joining the organization was in his good at the
          moment.
        </p>

        <p>
          There were many things in life that people had no control over and had
          to adjust accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          He also knew that not everything would occur as he wanted it to...
          there would be differences and he was preparing himself to be prepared
          to face those.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked at the numerous Rare Rank Artifacts and used [Cosmic Void
          Gaze] and confirmed that all of them were 100% real.
        </p>
        <p>He looked at them one by one and their descriptions.</p>
        <p>
          A bronze-headed mace that dealt twice the damage than a normal one...
        </p>
        <p>
          A cloth keeper crop that was created for defense, looked quite old and
          had a long list of previous owners...
        </p>
        <p>
          A copper Scythe for practical use, has the ability to harvest espera
          from flora and fauna to a limited degree...
        </p>
        <p>
          A Marble-Headed War Hammer capable of shattering robust shields and
          bones with a stun effect...
        </p>
        <p>
          A Cursed Sickle that cannot be sheathed until it has killed,
          bloodthirsty and a dark artifact like that medal...
        </p>
        <p>
          'I don't need these... I want something that can be incorporated into
          my daily life so that others don't even suspect it to be an
          artifact... these artifact weapons seem too big and flashy.'
        </p>
        <p>
          He withdrew his gaze and looked more and sorted out the artifacts that
          could be used in daily life and look ordinary in appearance.
        </p>

        <p>
          After a full ten minutes of endless search, he finally managed to sort
          out 3 top choices that he could use.
        </p>
        <p>
          [The Wrap of Quantum Darkness], as the name suggests it allows the
          owner to manipulate the element of darkness to conceal presence but
          use depends on the mastery of owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Energizing Sun Shoes], shoes that can absorb solar energy and grant
          the wearer an enhancement in speed and agility, further boost when
          exposed to sunlight. Movements become fluid and swift.
        </p>
        <p>
          And lastly, an Artifact named [Helm of Wings] which allowed its owner
          to fly for a short duration and some protection from projectiles
          providing defense in battles.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Hmm...' Oliver wanted all of them but knew he could not have all of
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          After thinking hard for another minute, he looked at Jenna and then
          said while holding the artifact.
        </p>
        <p>"I want this."</p>
        <p>Jenna raised a brow at his choice of artifact.</p>
        <p>___________________</p>
        <p>
          "Well then, come with me. Since now that you are an official member of
          the Black Codex Federation, there are some things you need to keep in
          mind."
        </p>
        <p>
          She said in her serious and strict tone, her black hair flowing behind
          her back as she walked back upwards and sat down at her desk.
        </p>
        <p>
          He quietly followed her back to the office room. He couldn't help but
          ask her once again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wouldn't my age be a hindrance while joining the organization, Boss
          Su?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver nicknamed her as "Boss Su," short for her surname Sullivan.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna who heard him dismissed his worry as she replied, "No. Age is
          just a number for us exorcists; we could extend our lives by hundreds
          of years easily and still maintain youth. The youngest to join the
          organization was as old as 13 years due to their ability. So you will
          be just a little younger."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver was speechless. Didn't that mean that he has become the
          youngest ever to join the Black Codex Federation?
        </p>
        <p>
          He shook his head, she was indeed correct. Exorcists didn't have
          ordinary lifespans of humans but could live as long as they continue
          to get stronger. The stronger an exorcist was, the greater their
          lifespan.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 35: A syringe and a... chip? Exorcist Web!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 35</p>
        <p>
          Exorcists had pseudo-immortality in a sense. To normal humans, they
          were like deities walking in plain sight, and that's why exorcists
          were respected everywhere in the normal world of humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, humanity was being protected by exorcists, so they
          naturally shared a higher status in society overall.
        </p>
        <p>
          But there were strict rules set by the clans for exorcists not to
          meddle too much in normal human society unless it was for demons or
          something important.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was believed that exorcists and normal humans should live separate
          lives. There have been incidents where heretics would abuse the powers
          of exorcism to rule over a village or small town of humans with
          tyranny.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, such heretics were quickly hunted down as soon as the news
          reached the clans or other organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Demons were already enough of an issue, so they could not afford to
          let their fellow species cause more trouble for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now that the war was at a stalemate for the time being, these heretics
          were being hunted down actively by other exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exorcists were also humans but at the same time, they were different
          from normal humans.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was best to draw a clear line between the two, as there have been
          since ancient times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Other than that, there were many rich normal humans who hired
          exorcists and whatnot. Firearms, technology, and everything was
          actively supplied to exorcist clans to make their lives and war
          easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Here. Take this." Jenna opened a locked door in her desk and
          retrieved a black chip with a cursive letter 'C' written on it in
          golden color.
        </p>

        <p>"A chip? What is it for?"</p>
        <p>"To inject it into your bloodstream," she said calmly.</p>
        <p>"What!?" He could not help but doubt her words.</p>
        <p>Inject the strange chip into his bloodstream?</p>
        <p>That sounded so uncomfortable and dangerous.</p>
        <p>
          Even in his previous world, no one ever dared to experiment with
          something this crazy on a human before.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes. You heard that right. Don't be a kid... err... I mean—a coward.
          This chip will directly register your blood signature into the
          organization's main database and allow you access to their virtual
          network to connect to. Not only that, this chip would also serve as
          proof of your loyalty to the organization."
        </p>
        <p>
          She looked at his hesitant and uncomfortable face and knew that he was
          worried about something foreign entering his body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry, it's not painful at all, just lightly press the chip
          against your skin for a few minutes, and it will automatically enter
          you."
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt this was quite terrifying; the Black Codex Foundation sure
          lived up to its name as he had read in the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was not that he was worried about the chip or anything, but he just
          felt uncomfortable letting something inside his body, something
          foreign like this chip.
        </p>
        <p>
          From the novel, he was aware that this chip just served as a
          connection between the individual and the Black Codex Federation's
          main database. Almost all members of the organization were given one
          at their joining.
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna probably said the words like loyalty and all to keep him aware
          that he must never betray the organization in the future as the chip
          would keep him in check.
        </p>

        <p>
          But he knew better. There were many ways he could hack into this chip
          and cheat the system. The chip did not have any monitoring function in
          it and was just a slightly advanced piece of machinery to maintain
          connection and authenticity.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were many unknown details, but he believed he could find them
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, the organization cared a lot for its true official
          members and won't do them any injustice so long they don't harbor any
          evil intentions towards the organization itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus any exorcist would not accept the idea of being controlled by
          someone or being monitored, while the organization had guts, they were
          not bold enough to upset their own members.
        </p>
        <p>
          He remembered the faces of some of the characters with extremely
          erratic personalities but yet they were treated like elites in the
          organization.
        </p>
        <p>'Well... anyways.'</p>
        <p>
          He decided to give it a try and pressed the chip against his left arm,
          holding it still for a minute before he felt a cool sensation around
          the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          He saw in excitement as the chip slowly started to assimilate itself
          into his skin before turning invisible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using [Cosmic Void Gaze], he could easily see the chip flowing through
          his arteries, slowly shrinking until it was as small as one-tenth of a
          fingernail.
        </p>
        <p>
          It might be done to prevent a member from trying to extract the chip
          through manual means.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could see how the small chip had mixed deeply in the blood, finding
          which was impossible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver knew that this chip was very advanced technology that the Black
          Codex Federation's best engineers have had developed.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was definitely prone to various medical analysis machines and
          wouldn't be detected in them either.
        </p>

        <p>
          Well, he could still spot the chip through his special eyes. No big
          deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Great, you are now officially a true member of Black Codex
          Federation. I'll provide you with the starting kit that all members
          receive upon joining."
        </p>
        <p>
          She said as she opened another drawer under her table and retrieved a
          black box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver curiously looked inside and found a variety of things inside
          the box.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, there was a syringe containing a seaweed-green colored
          liquid.
        </p>
        <p>She looked at him and answered his curiosity.</p>
        <p>
          "This is an attribute awakening essence. It's a potent essence
          extracted from a mysterious site. Upon injecting this, it will help
          you awaken a random attribute to your espera. All the members receive
          one."
        </p>
        <p>
          He heard her say and couldn't help but ask, "What essence is this?
          Which attribute will it awaken?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's completely random; the place from where this essence was
          extracted and refined from is also unknown. It depends on your luck
          which attribute you can awaken when you inject it."
        </p>
        <p>
          She paused before adding, "The only thing that I can tell you is that
          this was refined by the most skilled alchemists of the Black Codex
          Federation. You can inject it when you go back."
        </p>
        <p>He nodded, looking at the other things.</p>
        <p>Jenna then picked up a device and handed it to him.</p>
        <p>"What's this?" He asked.</p>
        <p>"A smartphone."</p>
        <p>"...."</p>
        <p>
          "I am aware of that. I wanted to ask what this thing is to be used
          for?" He clarified. He wanted to know if this was just an ordinary
          smartphone or had to be used in specified circumstances only.
        </p>
        <p>'Why do I feel like a spy...?'</p>
        <p>
          "This is a normal smartphone both in appearance and function, but I'll
          provide you with an access code that upon being used will allow you to
          enter the organization's secure web as well as the common exorcist web
          of the world."
        </p>
        <p>
          Pulling out a piece of ivory paper, she wrote a special code onto it
          and gave it to him.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 36: Forgot to buy meat!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 36</p>
        <p>
          "You can use it as you please; there are many things that are sold on
          the exorcist web. From online resources to specialized training
          modules. Of course, you can't let anyone know of this. Memorize this
          code and destroy it afterward."
        </p>
        <p>She handed him the piece of paper.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked at the code, and it was indeed quite long and complex,
          but he was able to memorize it quickly. Maybe it was due to the
          presence of espera that his brain worked faster and much more
          efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be honest, he was quite shocked that he got the access to not only
          the exorcist web but also the Codex network so easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naturally, he knew of the exorcist web; it was the network that
          connected exorcists all around the world. This place was primarily
          used for resource trading and information trade.
        </p>
        <p>
          A normal human with no background would never be able to access this
          web through any means. It was not a place where they would be allowed
          to mess.
        </p>
        <p>
          He had thought that he wouldn't be able to access the exorcist web
          until he joined the academy in the future or left the clan considering
          how strictly the web was monitored and regulated by the clans.
        </p>
        <p>
          But such an unexpected scenario occurred, and not only did he get the
          access to the exorcist web but also the entry to the Codex Web.
        </p>
        <p>Yes, the private network of the Black Codex Federation...</p>
        <p>
          He memorized the code and input it at the same time to see if it was
          working properly, and indeed it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could see a search engine and a variety of forums with different
          topics, all related to exorcists.
        </p>
        <p>
          He closed the phone and said, "This is quite convenient. As expected
          of the Black Codex Federation."
        </p>
        <p>
          Jenna looked at him and pondered about how he might be one of the
          youngest in the history to have access to the exorcist web.
        </p>

        <p>
          She suddenly felt like she was that old lady who would give children
          candy and then take them to travel around the world in her van...
        </p>
        <p>No... this felt illegal for some reason.</p>
        <p>She shook her head of such thoughts.</p>
        <p>
          "That's all, the rest of the stuff is some basic documentation. Feel
          free to burn them after reading it, or the ink will disappear on its
          own in a week."
        </p>
        <p>She handed him the black leather box and explained simply.</p>
        <p>
          Crossing her legs, Jenna could not help but think if it was the right
          choice to let a kid like him inside the organization just due to a
          moment's instinct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Was she being whimsical, or was there really something deep about this
          little boy?
        </p>
        <p>
          She had authority high enough in the organization to invite members,
          but expelling them required a series of discussions with other
          high-level members.
        </p>
        <p>So, in a sense, Oliver was more or less now a permanent member.</p>
        <p>
          It was one of those times where she felt indecisive in her life...
        </p>
        <p>
          But she could not help it; she felt a really strong intuition when she
          saw him casually bring out multiple artifacts and even an artifact of
          Epic rank as well. He was definitely not simple.
        </p>
        <p>"Alright then, I will leave."</p>
        <p>
          Oliver also bid her farewell; he had spent too much time in the
          marketplace, way more than he had expected.
        </p>
        <p>
          He must get home quickly and start practicing the technique he had
          bought.
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>

        <p>"Zippy! I am back!"</p>
        <p>
          Oliver announced as he returned to his courtyard, and soon a beautiful
          and white cat came near him.
        </p>
        <p>He looked at her and was impressed!</p>
        <p>
          Her disguise technique was very terrifying... white fur; she looked
          just like a cloud in the form of a cat.
        </p>
        <p>He picked her up and went inside, but he suddenly froze.</p>
        <p>'Fuck! I forgot to buy meat!'</p>
        <p>
          He looked at the white cat in his lap, and she also looked back at
          him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cat was clearly making an expression that said, where's the meat
          you promised?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uh..." He suddenly felt tongue-tied, not knowing what to say to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We will have meat tomorrow. Today we must finish the leftovers from
          yesterday."
        </p>
        <p>"???" The clan guardian.</p>
        <p>
          He coughed lightly and put her down and quickly excused himself to the
          kitchen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hastily looking around, he searched for anything that had been left
          from before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, it was the maid who cooked his meals, but he knew how to cook
          himself, albeit he was still a novice in cooking.
        </p>
        <p>Creak! Creak!</p>

        <p>
          He opened one shelf after another to look for ingredients he could
          use.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian would definitely be suspicious if he didn't feed her
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over the days, he had got to know her personality a little bit.
          Although she was not a cat exactly, her behavior was easily that of a
          cat.
        </p>
        <p>
          As long as her belly was full and she was fed regularly on precise
          timings, she would remain calm and happy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someday, due to his training or whatever reason, he forgets to feed
          her, she would act grumpy and even scratch him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sigh..." He suspected that the clan guardian didn't even require
          eating, yet this cat was quite demanding.
        </p>
        <p>'Well, at least I don't have to clean after her!'</p>
        <p>
          Oliver tried to think positively about having the clan guardian as his
          cat.
        </p>
        <p>Ultimately he found some rice and uncooked fish.</p>
        <p>His eyes lit up!</p>
        <p>He could definitely coax her with this.</p>
        <p>
          He quickly cooked rice with vegetables and cooked the fish, not
          forgetting to season it according to her taste.
        </p>
        <p>He made the rice for himself and fish for her.</p>
        <p>Soon, a strong aroma spread in all corners of the courtyard.</p>
        <p>
          The clan guardian, who was earlier infuriated at being lied to about
          meat, was instantly attracted.
        </p>
        <p>"Meow!"</p>
        <p>
          She jumped over and quickly came near the table where Oliver ate his
          meals.
        </p>
        <p>
          A freshly made fish was soon placed in front of her; just smelling the
          aroma was enough to make her salivate...
        </p>
        <p>
          She had eaten countless delicacies in her lifetime prepared by the
          best of chefs in the clan, but it has been a very very long time since
          she tasted this simple and good food.
        </p>
        <p>
          It gave her a comforting feeling, and that's also why she ate his
          cooking regularly.
        </p>
        <p>She felt that this life was not half bad!</p>

        <h2>Chapter 37: Evolving the Press of Liberty by 10 times!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 37</p>
        <p>A few weeks later...</p>
        <p>
          Oliver was behind his courtyard in the small secret area where he
          often hung out when he was alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But at the moment, he was not there to relax but for an entirely
          different reason.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fifty marks were drawn on the ground, each some distance away from the
          other.
        </p>
        <p>
          These marks were in the form of different shapes: circles, triangles,
          squares, and so on...
        </p>
        <p>
          Since the time he had returned to his courtyard, he had been
          diligently practicing the [Six Thoughtful Steps of the Spirits.]
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the movement technique, he must train his feet in such a
          way that they move with a grace that only spirits could exude, a
          fluidity that promotes his physical powers and espera alignment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rooted in the principles of balance, coordination, and intention, a
          calm mind serves as the core requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, Oliver was in a state of
          focus. His feet rooted to the earth beneath him, stabilizing his core
          muscles to adjust his posture and align his spine, he gazed at the
          various marks in front of him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath to center his
          focus and calm his mind.
        </p>
        <p>He suddenly moved!</p>
        <p>Swish! Swish!</p>

        <p>
          From one shape to another, he stepped on the center of each shape, his
          movements partially mindful and a hint of grace becoming evident as he
          moved from one to another.
        </p>
        <p>
          Taking the support of the earth beneath him, his body transitioned
          between the shapes, a strong intent of fluidity taking form.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone were to look at him at the moment, they would quickly
          notice that he was imitating gestures and flowing movements as
          inscribed in the technique scroll.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver narrowed his eyes; he could see that as he moved, the distance
          between the shapes widened...
        </p>
        <p>
          He had to move from one shape to the same shape distance away, meaning
          if he stepped on a circle, then he could only step on a circle next
          and then to another shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, there was no such absurd method mentioned in the [Six
          Thoughtful Steps of the Spirits] technique, but from his wide
          knowledge of the novel, he knew that the teacher of the protagonist
          who taught martial arts recommended this method to train in the
          beginning.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to that teacher, when training in movement technique, this
          was one of the best methods to choose from if one did not have any
          equipment or materials to support.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, Oliver naturally adopted this method. He knew just how fast the
          protagonist became in the future.
        </p>
        <p>Swish!</p>
        <p>
          His pace quickened as he moved even faster, his eyes catching
          everything in his surroundings, nothing escaping his sight.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apart from training his physical strength, he always focused on
          [Cosmic Void Gaze], his trump card at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
          And he could feel his mastery increasing gradually as days passed by.
        </p>
        <p>'Fuck!'</p>
        <p>
          He exclaimed as he suddenly lost balance and could not step on the
          next shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Huff... I need to learn to coordinate my body with the line of
          sight...'
        </p>

        <p>
          He thought as he wiped his sweat with a towel and drank a few
          mouthfuls of water.
        </p>
        <p>'But how do I achieve that...?'</p>
        <p>
          He wondered as he looked at the clear blue sky, his mind unable to
          help but wander to the scene he remembered from the novel.
        </p>
        <p>
          In that scene, when the war between demons and exorcists resumed, all
          hell broke loose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Countless lives were lost and formed, rivers of blood became as common
          as water...
        </p>
        <p>
          The exorcists were unyielding, and demons were terrifying; the
          protagonist slaughtered demons left and right without mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ground cracked, and the area of the battlefield was described to
          have formed a crimson-black sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both demons and exorcists brought out one artifact after another,
          massacring each other with no end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Many powerhouses were killed as if someone was plucking out cabbages
          from a field.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thousands of children lost their parents and vice-versa; it was one of
          the saddest periods of history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whenever the war between the two parties intensified, the world would
          suffer and cry tears of blood.
        </p>
        <p>
          His mind went back as his eyes became focused again, and he saw the
          sky was still blue and beautiful.
        </p>
        <p>
          He sighed... it was still too early for him to worry about the war.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was a lot of time until then, and he knew all the clans would be
          dragged into the war no matter what.
        </p>

        <p>He had to prepare for that time to ensure that he didn't die.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, he heard it!</p>
        <p>That familiar sound...</p>
        <p>
          [Ding! Target has mastered the rapier technique belonging to the
          Mystic Purge Clan after undergoing rigorous training. The Press of
          Liberty]

          [Ding! Obtaining 10x benefits. Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom
          has been obtained!]
        </p>
        <p>
          Just as the notification ended, a tornado of memories rushed into his
          mind, making him clutch his head in pain and close his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Kuh-!"</p>
        <p>
          His muscles and bones stirred as his body became adapted to accept the
          reward.
        </p>
        <p>A few minutes later, he calmed down.</p>
        <p>Huff... Huff...</p>
        <p>
          Taking deep breaths, his body relaxed as his tense forehead relaxed.
        </p>
        <p>
          He clutched his hand, a strange yet familiar feeling spread through
          his body and mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to hold a rapier at this moment very badly, but
          unfortunately, he didn't have any.
        </p>
        <p>
          He looked around and saw trees everywhere; he got up and went to a
          nearby tree, slowly climbing it until he reached a branch.
        </p>
        <p>Twisting the whole branch from the tree, he jumped down.</p>
        <p>
          Using his bare hands, he started to tear apart bits from the wooden
          branch, trying to make something similar to a rapier.
        </p>
        <p>Although crude, he did make something similar to a rapier.</p>
        <p>
          Holding the branch, he swung it into the air, producing a strong
          series of vibrations... it was as if the air was acting as the string,
          and he was the musician playing those invisible strings as he swung.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom] was an extremely powerful
          rapier technique from the knowledge he had obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the information, this technique was so strong that...

          Chapter 38: Honorable Stars Essence! Getting ready to meet Nadia
          again!
        </h2>
        <p>Chapter 38</p>
        <p>
          The [Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom] was an extraordinarily
          powerful rapier technique from the knowledge he had obtained.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the information, this technique was so strong that it
          could pierce through an army of armed soldiers when mastered to
          perfection!
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only that, but its name was derived from the [Press of Liberty.]
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Press of Liberty] was created by an ancient exorcist who excelled
          in rapier combat. He had no rivals when it came to using a rapier at
          that time, and he used his skills to fight against the tyranny of the
          lord of the kingdom where he lived and his army, ultimately freeing
          thousands of slaves from the tyrant.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later, the exorcist fought against demons until his last breath in
          order to let every single person on Earth be free of their fear of
          demons.
        </p>
        <p>
          This rapier technique at that time was not named by the exorcist but
          by the people who recorded his art and skills.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to his admirable attitude of providing everyone freedom and
          liberty, this art of rapier was later called the [Press of Liberty] as
          it helped countless people achieve liberty.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ancient exorcists were unparalleled when it came to refining their
          arts and exorcism techniques.
        </p>
        <p>
          The [Sovereign Strike of Infinite Freedom], a technique obtained after
          evolving the [Press of Liberty] tenfold, was undoubtedly better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using this martial art could help him exorcise an entire legion of
          demons at its full power, which was terrifying.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he must master this technique first for all that to happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          From Nadia, although he received tenfold rewards, the training
          experience he received, however, was also tenfold, but the
          requirements for the evolved techniques were also much higher than the
          normal ones.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, he must put in his own hard work to be able to master the
          technique, or else his own body would not be able to endure the burden
          of using such overpowered techniques in the future.
        </p>

        <p>
          He also felt it was reasonable; otherwise, it wouldn't make any sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I found the answer to my earlier question..." He looked excited as he
          found out from the experience he gained from Nadia about how to
          properly control and coordinate his body and mind with his line of
          sight and strength.
        </p>
        <p>
          Holding onto the branch, he closed his eyes and focused in front of
          him. He slowly aligned the branch straight in line with his chest.
        </p>
        <p>
          A moment went by, and he stood still; the world around him was still
          at this moment in his mind, he was alone in this world, no one was
          there to disturb his calm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, he opened his eyes and made a forward motion with the wooden
          branch.
        </p>
        <p>"Ha!"</p>
        <p>Boom!</p>
        <p>A strong shockwave blasted through the trees, wrecking them.</p>
        <p>
          The branch he was holding onto was also destroyed, unable to bear the
          load.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver looked in front of him; just the shockwave produced from his
          strike was enough to graze through the toughness of these thick tree
          trunks.
        </p>
        <p>
          He could only imagine how strong an esper-infused strike of this
          technique would be.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking at what was left of the branch in his hand, he felt satisfied.
          He should get himself a decent weapon soon.
        </p>
        <p>"But for now... it's time to finally awaken an attribute."</p>
        <p>____________________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver returned to his courtyard and got out the black box that he had
          received from Jenna.
        </p>

        <p>Click!</p>
        <p>
          With a clicking sound, he opened the box and saw the syringe
          containing the seaweed-green colored liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          He hadn't forgotten about this mystical thing at all; instead, he had
          been reading the documents Jenna had given him, plus the exorcist web,
          to learn about this strange liquid.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he could not find many clues about this syringe on the
          exorcist web, he was able to obtain information from the Codex web.
        </p>
        <p>
          This liquid in the syringe was called the Honorable Stars Essence, a
          mysterious essence that was concocted during a special phenomenon when
          the planets were aligned in a certain order. It required many precious
          materials to be made, from the dew of stars to lunar lotus.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, this was a very rare and expensive potion that could not be
          bought with money alone. It required connections with expert
          alchemists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver felt it was a waste to drink it on his own; he wanted to give
          it to Nadia and receive tenfold benefits, but over the past weeks, he
          could not get an opportunity to enter that area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those brats had ordered guards not to let him enter... he knew the
          guards would obey their duty and wouldn't dare to be careless.
        </p>
        <p>
          Plus, he was sure that even if the brats had not told the guards, the
          state he put his second brother into would definitely raise serious
          concern among his backers in the clan, which would lead to tighter
          security of the area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any unauthorized person would need to undergo a serious scan to enter
          the central area... and he was sure they would find the Honorable
          Stars Essence instantly if they scanned him.
        </p>
        <p>He was quite in a bind at the moment.</p>
        <p>Oliver, however, was not one to give up easily.</p>
        <p>
          He must make Nadia drink this no matter what. This was for his own
          benefit as well as hers.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, to counter the tight security measures in place, he had come up
          with two ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first way was to use his lazy cat to secretly reach out to Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          What he meant by that was that he would have to let this cat of his
          carry the Honorable Stars Essence and give it to Nadia safely.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although it would involve the clan guardian knowing about his
          affiliation with the Black Codex Federation, and he honestly had no
          idea how she would react to that, overall, it was a risky gamble that
          he wanted to avoid.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, he felt more inclined towards the second approach, which was to
          abuse his newfound powers that he had gained.
        </p>
        <p>It was now the moment for him to make use of some of his cards...</p>

        <h2>Chapter 39: Using the artifact and some... aphrodisiac?</h2>
        <p>Chapter 39</p>
        <p>
          First, he might have to create a strong disturbance or distraction
          large enough to divert the guards' attention for a short duration of
          time and utilize that moment to reach Nadia.
        </p>
        <p>
          After that, he could give the essence to her and return back and wait
          for the benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although he knew that the Mystic Purge Clan must also have their own
          Honorable Stars Essence made by the best alchemists in the clan.
        </p>
        <p>But he knew that Nadia would not be receiving them anytime soon.</p>
        <p>
          In the novel, Ophelia was an eccentric woman who followed her own
          ideologies and never respected the common sense of the world... and to
          her, Nadia was the most important person in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not as a daughter, but as a tool, apparently. She was obsessed with
          the idea of creating the perfect being, the perfect exorcist to ever
          exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Nadia so far was the one among her other children who had the
          potential to reach that stage, so she was very careful with every
          aspect of her daughter's growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver believed that his mother did not know that he had secretly fed
          Nadia a body-strengthening elixir or else he wouldn't be in his
          courtyard chilling but instead somewhere dark...
        </p>
        <p>
          He shuddered, not daring to imagine the atrocities Ophelia had
          committed in the novel to achieve her goals.
        </p>

        <p>
          The guards and tight security would definitely pose a huge problem; he
          knew of their strength.
        </p>
        <p>They were way above an average exorcist in the world in skills.</p>
        <p>
          In such situations, usually typical novel protagonists would be aware
          of secret passageways or something similar to evade the guards, but he
          was not in such a situation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using common sense, will a novel ever include the routes and layouts
          of a clan that the protagonist didn't even belong to? And let's assume
          even if there was such a route or layout mentioned, would a normal
          reader ever bother with memorizing that?
        </p>
        <p>
          No, of course not if you are a normal reader; most of the normal
          readers would usually skip through such content.
        </p>
        <p>
          And Oliver was the same; there was no mention of any routes or layouts
          of the Mystic Purge Clan in the novel, and not only that, even if
          there was, he had most likely skipped that part when he was a reader.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, even if there was a hidden path right below his courtyard leading
          directly to the central area, he would never know!
        </p>
        <p>This was the reality as well!</p>
        <p>
          The world was not always run by clichés; he was facing harsh
          situations over in his new life.
        </p>
        <p>No matter, everything was connected.</p>
        <p>He had already made a plan to slip through...</p>
        <p>He just needed the materials for the distraction.</p>

        <p>
          Afterward, he visited the clan market once again and purchased some
          stuff from different shops. Although the thing he purchased was the
          same, since he was buying in mass, he had to make sure to purchase
          from different shops at a good distance from each other.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the worst case, if everything crashed, he could at least try to
          make sure that he won't be traced back if he bought things like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention, he was also wearing a cap to hide his hair color as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Returning to his courtyard, he looked at the huge boxes of items. It
          was some thick smoke bombs and concentrated aphrodisiac that were
          enough to make even elephants unstable.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was going to use them to deter the guards, at least for a short
          duration. He knew these smoke capsules might not work for long against
          the guards, so he had especially purchased the aphrodisiac.
        </p>
        <p>
          The best way to attack an exorcist with esper as a common person or a
          person with lesser esper was to attack their mental state or make use
          of their emotions or urges.
        </p>
        <p>
          While he doubted that all of them would fall for it, it was enough; he
          could do well with that.
        </p>
        <p>"Phew, I am ready."</p>
        <p>
          He was slightly nervous for the stunt he was about to pull; never in
          his life had he expected that he would be doing something like this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in his previous life, he was a normal boy that rarely got into
          troubles with others, much less pulled any serious pranks.
        </p>
        <p>So, this was going to be a new experience for him.</p>
        <p>
          With that, he picked up the syringe and left the courtyard, not
          forgetting to leave some food for the sleeping cat.
        </p>

        <p>
          He knew the clan guardian would come in his use sooner or later, but
          probably now was not the time.
        </p>
        <p>__________________</p>
        <p>"And it's done!" He said wiping sweat off his forehead.</p>
        <p>
          Oliver set the capsules at different spots and arranged them in a
          specific way.
        </p>
        <p>
          He made sure that it was close to the guards stationed to the central
          area.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This should release the smoke and aphrodisiac together at the same
          time in around 20 minutes as the stick burns fully. With this, nothing
          will be left behind once the smoke capsule activates."
        </p>
        <p>
          He thought to himself as he quickly went to the opposite side of the
          entrance, far away from this arrangement. He wouldn't want to get
          caught up in smoke mixed with concentrated aphrodisiac.
        </p>
        <p>He secretly apologized to the oblivious guards in his mind.</p>
        <p>And then he finally took it out.</p>
        <p>
          A light-cream-colored cloak, a cloak that looked like a normal cloak a
          traveler would wear on their journey.
        </p>
        <p>But this was actually an artifact!</p>
        <p>
          At that time while at Jenna's secret room, he had ultimately chosen
          the [Wrap of Quantum Darkness].
        </p>
        <p>
          An artifact that let him conceal his entire presence by letting the
          owner manipulate the element of darkness to conceal presence but use
          depends on the mastery of the owner.
        </p>
        <p>For Oliver, this was the best choice indeed.</p>
        <p>
          If one can remember, he had the [Cosmic Void Gaze] and its first
          ability was [Dominion over Cosmic Voids.]
        </p>
        <p>
          It provides control over not only darkness but the vast void between
          cosmos. Superior form of the darkness element—Void.
        </p>
        <p>
          So naturally, the effect he would have on this artifact which utilized
          the darkness element would be amplified a lot considering he could
          directly use void element to...
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 40: Meeting Nadia again!</h2>
        <p>Chapter 40</p>
        <p>
          Awakening the [Cosmic Void Gaze] automatically gave him access to the
          Void element itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, the [Wrap of Quantum Darkness] that would help its owner conceal
          their presence using the darkness element would have an enhanced
          effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be something like having your entire existence shrouded for a
          short period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The void literally translated to 'nothing', so in a sense, upon using
          the artifact, he would be something akin to nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would be very difficult to spot, but since the artifact itself was
          Rare Rank, it had limited capabilities and worked for a certain period
          of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          He must use that time to reach Nadia and make her drink the Honorable
          Stars Essence.
        </p>
        <p>
          He wanted to know what sort of effect it would have on his
          awakening... if she awakened an element.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oliver activated the artifact, and he turned invisible to the naked
          eye and went towards the gate of the central area.
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>
        <p>"Hey, what is that?"</p>
        <p>
          One of the guards patrolling the gates suddenly pointed in the
          distance and asked in a loud voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Others also followed the direction and looked to see a huge and thick
          screen of smoke spreading towards them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Divide into two groups; one of the groups will go and verify what is
          going on with that smoke. Just in case, prepare to battle and
          apprehend anyone nearby for interrogation."
        </p>
        <p>
          The guards coordinated well and quickly split into two groups. They
          all knew that doing anything funny or strange near the residential
          area of main members of the clan was a serious offense.
        </p>

        <p>
          If the perpetrator had no good intentions, then the punishment could
          be as severe as execution.
        </p>
        <p>
          No matter who it was, they would be punished according to the clan
          rules.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were trained professionals, not fools who would easily get
          distracted. In the novels, it's just that the plot armor of the main
          character simply reduces the IQ of other people to make things work,
          but it won't work like that here.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first group of guards stayed there near the gates themselves, and
          the second group went over to the smoke to look for anomalies.
        </p>
        <p>
          They could not see through the smoke at all; it was quite thick, and
          their noses felt funny for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>On the other hand, the group that remained was also vigilant.</p>
        <p>
          "Keep looking around; we wouldn't want any unexpected individuals to
          sneak through in our presence!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The guard announced and kept a tight watch around his surroundings.
        </p>
        <p>___________________</p>
        <p>
          Oliver managed to easily sneak past the guards while they were
          splitting up into groups, and now he was back in the central area.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some troublesome memories returned to him when he remembered the faces
          of his 3rd brother and sister.
        </p>
        <p>
          He would not forget them so easily; they were going to suffer a fate
          worse than the 2nd brother since they were the ones who had beaten
          him.
        </p>
        <p>For now, he silently moved towards Nadia's courtyard.</p>
        <p>
          Upon arriving in the courtyard, he saw that it was empty; there were
          many metal puppets in her yard. Some of them were showing signs of
          wear and tear, while others were still in perfectly fine condition.
        </p>
        <p>She trained relentlessly.</p>
        <p>He looked around and could not see her.</p>

        <p>His expression turned weird.</p>
        <p>'Could it be that she's not here at the moment?'</p>
        <p>
          He had not considered the possibility of her not being available at
          all; he just assumed that she was going to be there when he visited.
        </p>
        <p>
          He frowned and thought about what to do... he cannot stay for too long
          either.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nor could he trust that no one would visit her courtyard if he left
          behind the syringe in here with a note or something.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be even worse if his mother decided to come in while he was
          still there.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not to mention someone else who might as well just take this for
          themselves. It was a really precious thing that exorcists would shed
          blood for if they knew.
        </p>
        <p>"What are you doing here again?"</p>
        <p>A chilling voice sounded behind him as he froze for a moment.</p>
        <p>
          He almost believed that his nightmare had come true and Ophelia was
          behind him, but although the voice was similar, he could tell who it
          was thanks to his keen memory.
        </p>
        <p>
          He turned around and saw Nadia standing behind him, her eyes
          expressionless and facial features stiff.
        </p>
        <p>He could not help but exclaim internally.</p>
        <p>
          She had grown quite strong in the short time; he could not sense her
          approaching him in the least. It's a pity that this was not considered
          a milestone by the system, or else he would have gotten the respective
          benefits too.
        </p>
        <p>
          He was not using [Wrap of Quantum Darkness] at the moment, so it was
          not a shock that she came behind him without him knowing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bypassing his senses with esper was very easy, and Nadia had abundant
          esper for her age.
        </p>
        <p>
          He envied having access to so much esper, but he was not worried much.
        </p>

        <p>
          Sooner or later, she was going to make a breakthrough in her ranks.
        </p>
        <p>
          When an exorcist steps up in ranks, their esper increases
          significantly, and when Nadia finally becomes a Rank-1 exorcist, he
          would naturally get access to esper and a lot of that. His esper
          talent would directly become tenfold of hers.
        </p>
        <p>He was just waiting for her to make a breakthrough.</p>
        <p>
          He suddenly felt a chill as he looked at her staring at him coldly as
          if waiting for an answer, her patience wearing thin.
        </p>
        <p>"Oh... I was here to... err... give you something."</p>
        <p>
          He said awkwardly; he did not know why he always felt the need to act
          formally when she looked at him like that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her presence was imposing, or maybe it was just that since she was a
          character from a novel who later turned out to be quite cruel that he
          felt such a way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonetheless, he took out the Honorable Stars Essence in the syringe
          under her narrowed eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Here."</p>
        <p>
          He wanted to give it to her quickly and leave, but something
          unexpected happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't need this." She replied in a calm tone, her intent hard to
          know.
        </p>
        <p>"What... why?"</p>
        <p>
          He looked at her in surprise; did she think he was giving her
          something suspicious?
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, the color of the liquid was indeed a bit weird, but it was
          definitely not poison.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't need your favors. I can grow strong on my own. I have told
          you before to not come here again, but yet you do? Do you not take my
          words seriously?"
        </p>
        <p>
          She asked as her expression darkened. She did not know why, but she
          was feeling angry at him for some reason.
        </p>
        <p>Anger? Was that how her emotion could be defined?</p>
        <p>
          She was told by her mother to be always calm in every situation no
          matter what, never show happiness, never show anger. Your enemies must
          never figure you out. Always remain rational.
        </p>
        <p>
          For happiness, show satisfaction; for anger, show dissatisfaction.
          Nothing more.
        </p>
        <p>Yet she felt angry now that Oliver was in front of her...</p>
        <p>And her reason for anger?</p>
