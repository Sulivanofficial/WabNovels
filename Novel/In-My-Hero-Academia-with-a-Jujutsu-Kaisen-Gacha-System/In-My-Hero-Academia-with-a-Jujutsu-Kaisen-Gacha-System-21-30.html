        <p>-</p>
        <p>
          I watched as Toga took a nervous step back. Her scared eyes scanned me
          up and down while occasionally looking around for an escape route.
        </p>
        <p>
          "W-who are you?" Toga whispered. "Did my p-parents send you to find
          m-me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked over Toga's state of dress and frowned. The girl was still
          wearing her school uniform, but at this point, it was hard to tell it
          was a uniform, given how dirty it was. Her skin was also covered in
          filth, and my enhanced sense of smell was able to pick up that she
          hadn't showered in a while.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, no. Those asshats didn't send me after you." I said as I threw
          back my hood. No need to keep scaring the girl.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Standing in front of me wasn't the Toga Himiko that would one day
          fight and kill for the League of Villians. No, this was the Toga
          Himiko which had recently went through a mental breakdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          A broken girl that had finally snapped and attacked her classmate,
          causing her to run away out of fear of the consequences.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Toga Himiko was just a scared, confused middle schooler. Not a
          trained killer.
        </p>
        <p>
          "My name is... Sukuna. Nice to meet you, Toga." I said as I took a
          seat on a nearby stack of wooden boxes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I intentionally made myself smaller to her in order to help calm her
          down. I wanted to tell her my real name, but I decided against it for
          now. I wanted to see how this plays out first.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh? Sukuna? Are you... with the police? A hero?" Toga asked as she
          held her boxcutter in front of her. But by the way the boxcutter shook
          in her dirty hands, it was easy to tell she was still terrified of me.
          "I-I'm not going back to them! I won't! I can't!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Easy there. No one's taking you anywhere you don't want to go." I
          said with my hands raised. I then slowly reached into my jacket and
          pulled out a paper bag. Toga watched me carefully as I reached into
          the bag and pulled out a warm meat bun. "You hungry?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm not-" A low, rumbling sound echoed from her stomach, causing the
          girl to blush in embarrassment and frustration. "I'm not hungry..."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+25 SP]</strong></p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          "That so? Well, I'm famished." I said as I placed the wrapped-up meat
          bun a good distance away from me on the wooden box I sat on and pulled
          out another bun from the bag. "Ima eat."
        </p>
        <p>
          And so I did. Who would have thought meditating all day without eating
          a thing would cause one to be painfully hungry?
        </p>
        <p>
          I ate my food silently while keeping an eye on Toga. She looked away
          from me toward the other end of the alley but then back at the waiting
          meat bun. Her stomach rumbled again, causing her to grimace.
        </p>
        <p>
          She then shuffled closer and snatched the meat bun away. Toga quickly
          unwrapped the bun and began to eat with gusto.
        </p>
        <p>
          "These buns are my favorite. The old woman who makes them always makes
          the dough fresh every day." I said softly and took another bite. "She
          doesn't just make meat buns, though. There's a multitude of flavors,
          too."
        </p>
        <p>
          Toga ignored me and continued to eat like a starving animal. I smiled
          and slid over another bun for her, which she quickly took while
          throwing me a suspicious glare.
        </p>
        <p>"I... like sweet things."</p>
        <p>
          "That so?" I smiled at her and then brought out a canister. "Water?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Toga paused mid-bite and eyed the canister suspiciously. I chuckled,
          took a sip from it, and then held it back out. "See? It's not poisoned
          or anything."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><i>It's not like it would do anything to me if it was.</i></p>
        <p>
          Toga frowned and then snatched the canister out of my hand quickly.
          She eyed the finish of the canister and then back at my lips with
          hesitation. Finally, she gave in and took several long, thirsty gulps
          from the canister.
        </p>
        <p>
          When she was done, she let out a long gasp, her face contorting into a
          wide, satisfied smile. Her eyes then grew wide, and her arm flew up to
          cover her lower face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hooh? You have a pretty cute smile there." I leaned back on the wall
          behind me and pointed at my teeth. "I like your sharp fangs."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+35 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "...y-you do?" Toga asked in a small, hushed voice. Her body shrank
          into itself as she looked at me with distrust and some hope.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh yeah. Anyways, what were you planning on doing here, Toga?" I
          asked as I looked down at the boxcutter in her hand. "What were you
          planning to do with that?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I... I was..." Any sense of ease Toga had built up disappeared as she
          returned to her flight or fight mode. "Blood... Saito-kun... I
          didn't..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's alive, you know? That classmate of yours." I said while taking
          out a picture of a black-haired kid who looked like Izuku in a
          hospital gown. I held it out for her with an easy-going smile. "You
          didn't kill him."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+40 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Toga's eyes were wide in surprise, and the boxcutter in her hand fell
          on the ground as she grabbed the picture from my hand. Her legs began
          to shake from under her until her knees gave out, causing her to fall
          to the ground. Tears began to fall from her eyes as she looked down at
          the picture of her classmate.
        </p>
        <p>
          "S-Saito-kun. I didn't... kill him." Toga whispered as her shoulders
          trembled. "He's alive. But..." She then looked up at me with the
          saddest smile I've ever seen. "But I'm still a monster. A demon."
        </p>

        <p>
          <i>Poor girl. What have your parents done to you? Great, now </i>I
          <i
            >feel like I'm the monster for wanting to use you as my points
            farm.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          She then hugged herself as her head hung low. "I... was told not to
          smile. I was j-jealous of everyone..." Toga stared down at the picture
          in her hands with a frown. "Saito-kun... I had a crush on him. And
          then that day happened, and I was so transfixed on the blood on his
          face. It was beautiful. But I couldn't ask him for his blood because
          if I did... he would say I wasn't human... just like Mother and
          Father."
        </p>
        <p>
          I kneeled down in front of her and hesitantly placed a hand on her
          trembling shoulder. Even after all this time, I was still dogshit at
          talking to or comforting people. Especially with sensitive stuff like
          this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Man, where was Izuku when you needed a protagonist-powered speech?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Toga... you're not a monster. Far from it. I've come into contact
          with some real monsters in human skin... You're not even close to
          resembling one." I said softly. Toga shook her head and leaned away
          from my touch. I frowned and pulled her in for a hug. A hug that she
          fought to escape from.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+40 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Let me go! Let me g-go!" Toga tried to push me away, but my greater
          strength kept her in place. "You don't even know me!"
        </p>
        <p><i>But I do know you. At least, a version of you.</i></p>
        <p>
          "Listen to me!" I grabbed her face so she could look me straight in
          the eyes. Her large, wet eyes were looking at me with sadness and
          hurt. "Forget what your damn parents said to you! They're wrong!
          You're not a monster or a demon or anything like that! You're just a
          middle-school girl!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+65 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Toga's hands slowly came up and grabbed my own. "But I... I like
          drinking blood. That's not... normal. I'm not normal."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hah! Normal? The fuck does that mean?" I smiled and pulled back my
          hands. After taking off my gloves, I held out my palms in front of
          her. I then activated my technique, causing a stream of blood to flow
          out of my palm. The blood then shifted into different shapes. "You
          know, people like us, those with blood type... abilities, aren't
          looked upon nicely by society. We're looked at like freaks, and no one
          wants to see what we can do just because of some blood. Hell, the
          people out there avoid me just because they get a bad feeling! The
          pussies. But you know what I say? Fuck em! Fuck them to hell and back.
          Why can't we live like we want, like everyone else?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          What I said was true. In this super-hero society. Those with
          uncomfortable or "gross" quirks were looked at with disdain and
          disgust. Vladking had to prove himself for several years until his
          blood type quirk was seen as okay. And that was with the benefit of
          being a famous pro hero with great connections.
        </p>
        <p>
          But not everyone can be like him, a famous pro. Everyone with what
          were deemed as uncomfortable quirks had to hide their abilities just
          for the chance to fit in. It wasn't fair. That goes twice for the
          Heteromorphs.
        </p>
        <p>This society wasn't fair.</p>
        <p>But was any society fair?</p>
        <p>
          Throughout my speech, Toga began to smile wider and wider. A look of
          happiness and relief flooded her face. Seeing that, I continued.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So what if you drink blood? If you want, I'll let you drink mine!" I
          grinned at her and slid back my sleeves in order to hold out my bare
          forearm for her to bite. She looked down at my forearm with a deep
          desire. Her eyes transfixed on my veins.
        </p>
        <p>"...are you sure?"</p>

        <p>"Yup, go nuts. And don't worry about me. I'm built different."</p>
        <p><strong>[+150 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Toga looked unsure but then shyly opened her mouth to reveal her sharp
          fangs. She grabbed my arm gently and brought it close to her lips.
          Before biting down, she looked up at me questioningly. I smiled and
          nodded at her. Toga blushed and sank her teeth into my forearm.
        </p>
        <p>
          Her fangs hurt for a split second, but Yuji's pain tolerance made it
          so as if she wasn't biting me at all. Toga's face grew blissful as a
          deep, red blush covered her face as she drank away. She was starting
          to remind me of a cat, especially considering her eyes, so I began to
          pet her head out of instinct.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a minute or so, I began to feel a bit lightheaded. Thankfully,
          she pulled away, seemingly having her fill. She licked the dripping
          blood off my forearm and then off her lips with a clouded look in her
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How do I taste?" I asked in amusement as Toga leaned into my chest.
          Her eyes began to close slowly as her breath began to slow. Just
          before she fell asleep, Toga whispered a single word.
        </p>
        <p>"Heavenly."</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          A soft glow filled the room as dawn light pierced through the windows.
          Himiko stirred, her mind slowly unfurling from the depths of sleep.
          For a moment, she was enveloped in a cocoon of warmth and comfort, but
          as awareness crept in, she felt a flicker of disorientation. The sheet
          beneath her was unfamiliar, cool against her skin, and she could hear
          the faint sound of birds chirping outside.
        </p>
        <p>This wasn't her bed.</p>
        <p>This wasn't her house!</p>
        <p>
          Himiko's eyes snapped open, blinking against the brightness, and she
          quickly propped herself out of bed. She looked around the bare room.
          The floors were made of pristine hardwood, and the walls were painted
          soft beige. A large dresser and desk stood on the other side of the
          room. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves outside, casting fleeting
          shadows across the space, creating a dreamy yet unfamiliar atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Panic fluttered in her chest as memories from the night before began
          to assemble.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"Forget what your damn parents said to you. They're wrong! You're
            not a monster or a demon or anything like that! You're just a
            middle-school girl!"</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko remembered the strange boy's words, causing a wave of warmth to
          flood her chest. Anxiety filled her as the thought of her meeting with
          Sukuna was nothing more but a dream.
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko swung her legs over the side of the bed. The chill of the
          wooden floor met her bare feet, grounding her in reality. Himiko
          noticed that she was still in her dirty, tattered school uniform. This
          gave her a sense of relief that nothing had happened to her while she
          was asleep. She took a deep breath, attempting to calm the whirlwind
          inside her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "No. It wasn't a dream. Last night was real... right?" Himiko said as
          she stepped through the sliding shoji door; the soft sound of the door
          gliding on its track welcomed her into the gentle tranquility of the
          traditional Japanese home Himiko found herself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The coolness of the hardwood floors enveloped her bare feet, their
          cool texture comforting beneath her as she took a moment to breathe in
          the faint scent of cedar that lingered in the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sunlight filtered through the rice paper screens, casting delicate
          patterns on the floor and illuminating the carefully arranged
          tokonoma, a small alcove that displayed a simple yet elegant piece of
          art—a hanging scroll depicting serene mountains, accompanied by a
          single ikebana flower arrangement.
        </p>
        <p>
          As she moved further inside, the dim light of the interior contrasted
          with the vibrant garden colors visible through another shoji window.
          The well-kept garden, with its moss-covered stones and neatly trimmed
          bonsai trees, beckoned with the promise of peace. The gentle rustle of
          leaves in the breeze and the distant sound of flowing water from a
          small stone basin added to the natural atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          Continuing her exploration, she found a small library full of books
          and manga. Stepping inside, Himiko looked over to a reclining chair
          where a novel sat on the armrest. Losing interest, she then walked out
          into the strangely western-styled living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko perked up when she heard the sounds of swooshes cut through the
          air. Despite her apprehension, Himiko walked to the shoji door that
          led outside. Sliding the door open, she saw a vast open courtyard
          where a young black-haired boy her age was going through several katas
          with his black and gold staff. The boy was dressed differently from
          last night, now in a black martial arts gi.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, Himiko could still recognize him as the boy who voluntarily
          gave her his blood. Oddly enough, he lacked the sharp black tattoos
          from last night, and his hair wasn't brushed back. It now sat in a
          loose, wild fashion on his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sukuna?" Himiko asked carefully, her cheeks tingling as a blush grew.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sukuna quickly stopped an overhead swing with his staff and turned to
          her with a small smile, sending a wave of warmth through Himiko's
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, Toga. You're finally up," Sukuna said as he walked over to her
          with his staff over his shoulders. "You hungry?" Sukuna then looked
          her up and down, causing Himiko to feel self-conscious suddenly.
        </p>
        <p>"Actually, how about a bath first? And some new clothes?"</p>

          After throwing Toga's dirty clothes in the wash, I returned to the
          kitchen to start breakfast while she cleaned herself up. While I
          wasn't the greatest cook, I was decent at making essential dishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then." I tied the straps of my black apron and washed my hands.
          "Let's see what to do. What to do..."
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked over to my stove and flicked on the heat while placing a
          nonstick pan on the burner. From there, I walked over to the fridge
          and pulled out several ingredients for my planned meal: steamed rice,
          miso soup, grilled fish, and various side dishes.
        </p>
        <p>A traditional Japanese breakfast.</p>
        <p>
          Personally, I would have gone with some waffles and bacon, but I
          didn't know what Toga liked to eat. Well, other than sweets. Better to
          go with something familiar.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I lost myself in the cooking rhythm, I heard Toga's soft footsteps
          approaching. I looked away from the cooking fish to see her clean as a
          whistle while dressed in some of my old clothes. They were from when I
          was a little younger, so they fit her pretty well. Her blonde hair was
          no longer crusty and dirty; it was now soft and with a bright sheen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toga paused at the entrance of my living room and looked at me
          awkwardly; her hands and feet moved around nervously.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Go on, take a seat." I flipped my fish over to see some beautiful
          grill marks. "Food should be ready soon. Make yourself at home."
        </p>
        <p>"Okay," Toga muttered and walked over to the dining table.</p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Taking a seat, she watched me cook with attentive eyes that reminded
          me of a curious house cat. I grinned at the mental visual. Soon
          enough, I finished cooking today's breakfast and placed all the dishes
          on the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          After removing my apron, I sat in front of Toga and grabbed my
          chopsticks to eat. I paused as I grabbed some rice when Toga didn't
          grab her eating utensils.
        </p>
        <p>"What's up?"</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, it's just that you didn't give thanks." Toga lifted her hands and
          placed them together. "My... parents said to always give thanks before
          eating."
        </p>
        <p>"Ah, right. Forgot that was a thing."</p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I nodded, placed my chopsticks down, and pressed my hands together. We
          both gave thanks and began eating our food. As we ate, Toga looked at
          me nervously and then over to the empty chairs beside us.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are your... parents not going to join us?" Toga said as she sliced a
          piece of her fish. Her chopsticks shook as she tore the flesh into
          pieces.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nah, I don't got any parents. They died during a villain attack a
          couple years back." I said in what I hoped was a calm tone as I sipped
          my soup. "It's just you and me here, Toga. So relax. No one's going to
          jump out and take you away."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that..."</p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >This is weird. I'm so used to the crazy Yandere version of Toga
            that it almost feels like I'm talking to another person.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I couldn't help but wonder just what the original Toga Himiko went
          through in her years of running from the police and killing who she
          wanted for blood.
        </p>
        <p>Living on the streets really does change a person.</p>
        <p>
          "It's fine, it's fine. Now then... what do <i>you </i>plan on doing?"
          I asked as I turned serious, causing Toga to stiffen. "Once your
          clothes are done being cleaned, you're free to go. I'm not holding you
          here against your will. You're free to leave anytime you want."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I..." Toga looked down at her half-eaten miso soup with unsure and
          reluctant eyes. "I don't... know what to do. I can't go back home. The
          police, my parents, everyone... they're looking for me. I-I don't want
          to go to
          <i>jail</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm, then where will you go?" I placed my elbows on the table while I
          rested my chin on my hands. "You gonna leave the city? The country?
          What's your next move?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>

        <p>
          Toga pressed her lips together and placed her chopsticks down. She
          brought her hands over her lap and squeezed them tight in frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Damn, I feel scummy. I'm practically backing her in a corner. But
            still, this should benefit us both.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>"I think-" Toga closed her eyes, but I suddenly interrupted her.</p>
        <p>
          "Haah! Man, I sure do have a <i>big </i>house!" I leaned back in my
          chair with my hands behind my head; the abrupt loudness of my voice
          caused Toga to jump in her chair. Her cat-like eyes looked at me in
          surprise and confusion. "Living here on my own sure is lonely. It sure
          would be nice if I had a cool new, blood-obsessed roommate to share it
          with!"
        </p>
        <p>"...huh?"</p>
        <p>
          "But where would such a person be?" I leaned forward and made an
          exaggerated thinking motion. I then grinned at her. "You know anyone
          like that?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "I don't understand. Why? Why are you doing all this?" Toga asked with
          genuine confusion. "Why are you being so kind to me?"
        </p>
        <p><i>Ain't that the million-dollar question?</i></p>
        <p>
          There was no way I could up and say I wanted to keep her around to
          farm points.
        </p>
        <p>No, that would be ridiculous.</p>
        <p>
          Even if I did say that, I knew that statement wouldn't be entirely
          true.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the original story, I always felt bad for some of the members of
          the League of Villians. Most of them were just the rejects of society
          who had no one to turn to until they found each other. I know they did
          some extremely horrible stuff, but none of that has happened in this
          world. At least for some of their members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Just like my friend Jin, Toga had yet to do anything horrible. In my
          opinion, at least. Sure, she attacked and nearly killed her classmate,
          but that was an accident due to her mind cracking under years of
          verbal abuse and pressure to conform.
        </p>
        <p>
          With that in mind, I can't help but feel a sense of responsibility
          towards her. Maybe it's because I see a different side of her, a side
          that's vulnerable and in need of help. This Toga could still be saved.
          She could still have a future—a happy ending.
        </p>
        <p>And I wanted to give her that.</p>
        <p>
          Not because I was some hero or pillar of Justice but because I
          couldn't ignore her pain.
        </p>
        <p>It was simply because I <i>wanted</i> to do so.</p>
        <p>I swear, Izuku was a bad influence on me.</p>
        <p>
          "I wish I could say I was doing this out of the kindness of my heart.
          But humans aren't like that." I said while looking out at my courtyard
          from the still-open shoji door. "I suppose you could say I helped you
          out of a whim. But that just sounds like a flimsy excuse."
        </p>
        <p>"Then why?"</p>
        <p>
          "I guess... I just wanted to help you." I turned back to her and
          smiled. "I wanted save Toga Himiko. It's as simple as that."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+50 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          A long silence fell over my living room as Toga stared at me
          wide-eyed. Her right hand rose over her heart, and she tilted her head
          down so her bangs hid her face. Her other hand rose and swiped across
          her eyes where hidden tears no doubt fell.
        </p>
        <p>"You mean it?"</p>
        <p>"I do."</p>
        <p>"You don't think I'm a monster?"</p>
        <p>
          "I don't. I told you already, didn't I? You're just a cute middle
          school girl with a pretty smile. You're not a monster or anything like
          that."
        </p>
        <p>
          "...okay," Toga whispered before she sat up straight. She had a large,
          pretty smile as she looked at me with an emotion I could not quite
          place. "I'll be in your care then."
        </p>

        <p>I nodded and smiled back.</p>
        <p>"Welcome home, Toga."</p>
        <p><strong>[+150 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"Himiko... Call me Himiko."</p>
        <p>"You got it. Oh, by the way, my actual name is Shimizu Souta."</p>
        <p>"Hmm, I like Sukuna-kun better."</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>"Izuku-kun! Over here!"</p>
        <p>
          Midoriya Izuku looked over to see his blue-haired friend, Hase Keiko,
          waving at him from his classroom entrance. She had a bead of sweat on
          the side of her face from running across the school to come pick up
          her friend. Those still hanging around the classroom turned to her
          briefly before shrugging. Keiko's presence had been a repeat
          occurrence in the room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hase-san!" Izuku said as he quickly placed his books into his school
          bag. "What are you doing here?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiko grinned and lifted a packed lunch. "Wanna have lunch with me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "O-oh! Yes! Of course!" Izuku blushed in embarrassment as he stood up
          from his chair with his yellow backpack strung on his back.
        </p>
        <p>"I just have to go buy some."</p>
        <p>
          "Ah, don't worry about that. I made some extra, so you're welcome to
          eat it!"
        </p>
        <p>"Are you sure? I don't want to be a-"</p>
        <p>"You're no bother, Izuku-kun. Now let's go eat!"</p>
        <p>
          Izuku smiled as he and Keiko walked through the halls of Aldera Junior
          High. The halls were rather packed, with students moving to their
          preferred lunch spots or heading to the cafeteria. Despite that, the
          two quickly reached their favorite place: a bench under a large tree
          in the school's open courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once they were situated, the two began to eat Keiko's packed lunch. At
          the same time, they chatted about random topics, primarily topics
          revolving around the newest pro heroes around the world or All Might.
          In the end, they ended up focusing on the subject of the latest TV
          anime that was released a month ago.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know, I still can't believe how cool the Teenage Mutant Ninja
          Turtles are! I thought the manga was great, but the anime adaptation
          somehow elevated several of the manga's panels!" Izuku said as he
          grinned in excitement while holding the last volume of TMNT.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiko nodded with a smile as she placed the empty lunch boxes into her
          school bag. "Right? I mean, four mutant turtles trained in ninjutsu
          living in the sewers—what's not to love? Oh! Oh! Who's your favorite?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm, that's a tough question... I think I have to go with Leonardo.
          He's the leader and so disciplined. I really admire his dedication."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good choice! I like Raphael. He's got that whole tough-guy thing
          going on, but you can definitely see his softer side, too. I
          appreciate his passion. He kinda reminds me of Sou-chan a little."
        </p>
        <p>
          "True! Raphael does have that intense attitude like Souta-san. What do
          you think about their dynamic as brothers?" Izuku asked.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's awesome! They balance each other out so well. You've got Leo's
          focus, Raph's aggression, Donatello's brains, and Michelangelo's
          carefree spirit. It's like a perfect recipe for adventure." Keiko said
          as she held up a finger with each point she made about the turtle
          brothers. "And it teaches a good lesson about teamwork. Even though
          they argue sometimes, they always come together when it counts."
        </p>
        <p>"Exactly! Speaking of which, do you remember that scene where-"</p>
        <p>"What the hell are you two nerds doing here?"</p>
        <p>
          Izuku and Keiko both stopped their excited conversation to look over
          at the three newcomers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing a few meters away were Bakugo Katsuki and his two
          ever-present followers. Katsuki had his hands in his pockets while an
          annoyed expression marred his face. The two followers behind him
          looked at one another with nervous expressions before they forced on
          looks of confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kacchan," Izuku said evenly. Keiko frowned as she turned to Katsuki.
          "We were just having lunch."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, yeah? Well, keep it down. I don't need you and your little
          girlfriend bothering me with all your geek talk, Deku." Katsuki said
          with his usual loud bravado as he glared at Izuku and Keiko.
        </p>
        <p>
          "S-she's not my girlfriend, Kacchan. Hase-san is just my friend."
          Izuku said with a slight blush on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bakugo-san. Did you perhaps stub your toe this morning?" Keiko said
          with a kind smile, causing Katsuki to twitch and turn to her with a
          snarl. "Oh my, such a nasty look. Do you have something in your eye?"
        </p>

        <p>"What did you say, you bitch?"</p>
        <p>
          "It seems all your little explosions have caused you to be hard of
          hearing. You should get that looked at. It would be a shame if you
          became deaf in a few years." Keiko said as she placed her hands on her
          knees, a calm smile on her face. Izuku sighed and looked over to his
          friend nervously.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hase-san," Izuku whispered to try to calm down his friend. "Calm
          down."
        </p>
        <p>
          To Izuku's knowledge, Keiko was usually a very happy and positive
          person. Over the last two years, she had been a bright light in his
          life. The days that he spent alone due to his condition were no more,
          thanks to her and his friend/teacher, Shimizu Souta.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her usual bubbly attitude, Keiko quickly became upset with
          anyone who bothered or made fun of Izuku for his quirklessness. It was
          as if she transformed into a different person. This change was both
          frightening and flattering for Izuku.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who do you think you are, huh?!" Katsuki growled as he took a step
          forward to Keiko but didn't move any further. "<i>That </i>guy isn't
          here, yet you're so confident. You think you're stronger than me! Is
          that it?!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiko suddenly lost her smile and stood up with her hands on her hips.
          "I don't like fighting, Bakugo-san. So, I'll use my words instead.
          Please leave Izuku-kun and myself alone. We only have a few minutes
          left of lunch, and we don't want to waste them bickering with you."
        </p>
        <p>"Hah! You damn-"</p>
        <p>
          "Kacchan!" Izuku stepped beside Keiko and turned to Katsuki with a
          nervous but stern expression. "That's enough. There's no need for us
          to argue. We'll tone down our volume so we won't bother you, okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Katsuki looked stunned at Izuku's sudden boldness. His red eyes looked
          over Izuku's body to see that his lith muscles sat under his school
          uniform. Even the way he stood was steady and loose, as if ready for
          anything.
        </p>
        <p>"Deku... you..."</p>
        <p>
          Katsuki grit his teeth tightly as he stared into Izuku's unflinching
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >'Damn you, just how much have you changed Deku! Is it all because
            of </i
          >that <i>guy?'</i> Katsuki thought angrily.
          <i>'Damn you! Damn him!'</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bakugo-san. I think-" The boy with the long hair nervously said as he
          looked around the courtyard where several students were watching the
          altercation. Some were even whispering about how Katsuki was trying to
          fight Keiko, one of the student body's favorite students, due to her
          happy and bubbly personality. "I think we should back off before
          someone calls a teacher."
        </p>
        <p>
          Katsuki spun around to yell at him and noticed that several students
          were indeed watching him. Some of them even had their cell phones out
          to record them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not wanting to get in trouble and possibly ruin his chances of getting
          into his dream school, UA Highschool, Katsuki sucked his teeth and
          began walking away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This isn't over, Deku, Twin Tails! Not by a long shot." Katsuki said
          as he and his followers left the courtyard.
        </p>
        <p>
          Izuku sighed in relief and turned to Keiko, who was rubbing her head
          in exhaustion.
        </p>
        <p>"That guy sure is a ball of nerves."</p>
        <p>"H-he's not that bad."</p>
        <p>
          "..." Keiko squinted her eyes at Izuku, causing him to shrink under
          her gaze. "I'll believe it when I see it." She then sat back down and
          grabbed the TMNT volume that Izuku had placed on the bench. "Now then,
          where were we?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Izuku smiled and sat beside Keiko. The two of them fell back into
          their conversation until the school bell rang.

        <h2>Chapter 23: NO. 23 - Hard-Hard Way</h2>
        <p>"Hey, you okay? You're making our team look like shit!"</p>
        <p>"Hm, oh yeah. I'm fine. Just a bit tired."</p>
        <p>
          Rubbing my face with my hand, I looked over at Twice from the couch we
          were sitting on with tired eyes. The two of us were playing the latest
          installment of Call of Duty. I looked at my score and saw that I was
          going negative while Twice was on the top of the scoreboard.
        </p>
        <p>Fucking try hard.</p>
        <p>
          "Perhaps you've been taking on too many hours at work? Nah! He just
          needs to drink more coffee, is all!" Twice's fingers clicked on his
          controller with rapid speed and skill. The man was racking up kill
          after kill with effortless ease.
        </p>
        <p>I'll give the man this: he's a god-tier gamer.</p>
        <p>
          "I guess that's part of it," I muttered as I tapped away on my
          controller. I cursed when my character was sniped from across the
          urban map we were on with a perfect headshot. "Damn you, NoobMaster69.
          It's always you!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh yeah, that guy is pretty good. He's nothing compared to me! The
          scrub!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled lazily as Twice and I continued playing through several more
          matches. As we did, my mind melted away into what I'd been up to
          during the past few weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
          My newest roommate and friend, Himiko, had quickly settled in with me
          after our little talk. It didn't take long for her shy and reserved
          personality to melt away into a more happy and playful one, similar to
          the one her main canon counterpart had.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a welcome home present, I took her out incognito to one of the
          nearby shopping centers so she could buy some clothes and fill out her
          room with whatever she wanted. She was hesitant to take advantage of
          my money, but I waved that away. At this point, money wasn't a big
          concern to me with all my sources of income.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving the green light, Himiko went absolutely crazy on her
          shopping trip. She went from store to store, picking and choosing
          everything that looked cute to her. Don't even get me started on how
          many hours we spent clothes shopping.
        </p>
        <p>My poor wallet sure took a hit that day...</p>
        <p>
          Despite the hit my finances took, Himiko's bright and free smile
          somehow made it worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, the two of us lived together as any two good roommates
          would. We each had our fair share of responsibilities and tasks to
          help around the house. Himiko even offered to take care of our meals.
          Something about not wanting to be a complete free-loading sponge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite her much happier disposition now, I knew she couldn't continue
          living like this. I didn't want her to constantly look over her
          shoulder for police, private investigators, or even heroes, worried
          that she might be arrested for the crime she committed.
        </p>
        <p>
          That's not the life I wanted her to live. I wanted her to be free to
          do what she wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
          This meant I would soon have to enact <i>that </i>plan to ensure it
          happened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving on from my blood-obsessed blonde friend, Mei had begun to move
          on from her large projects to much smaller, more focused inventions.
          These were more in line with the support gear heroes would use in
          their line of work. Which meant I was up for several more hours of
          testing each new brainchild of hers.
        </p>
        <p>Some of which exploded in our faces.</p>
        <p>
          Inventing and testing weren't everything Mei and I did together over
          the weeks. I had decided that she needed to get out of her workshop
          more, so I took her out to explore the city more often, much to her
          annoyance. Thankfully, it didn't take that long for her to forget
          about her babies and ease into having fun with me as we traveled
          around.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can still remember her ecstatic expression when I took her to the
          yearly Tokyo Inventors Convention. She was like a kid at a candy
          store, going from stand to stand, peppering the overwhelmed inventors
          with thousands of questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, when it came to hanging out with Izuku and Keiko, they
          were a welcome break from the craziness of my pink and blonde-haired
          friends.
        </p>
        <p>
          My time with the two hero-obsessed nerds was spent focusing on their
          training. Keiko with her quirk and Izuku with his physical/martial
          arts training.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiko's proficiency with her quirk was slowly but surely improving.
          She now had little issues using her typically defensive quirk in an
          offensive style. Her barriers were even able to hold back a low
          CE-enhanced attack from me for a few seconds.
        </p>

        <p>
          Izuku's progress was impressive. His body was slowly gaining more and
          more muscle from my carefully planned exercises made for him. It
          wouldn't be much longer for his body to resemble that of a
          professional young athlete. Along with his athletic build, Izuku's
          martial arts were steadily improving.
        </p>
        <p>
          His ability to take in a new technique was an odd one. Izuku wouldn't
          learn what I taught him the way I wanted him to; no, he would instead
          take the technique I wanted him to learn and internalize it in a way
          only he would understand. While I'm glad it worked for him, it did
          slow down his rate of learning, which was fine with me.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this rate, I had no doubt he would be a little monster when he got
          All For One in a few years.
        </p>
        <p>
          The largest contributor to my lack of energy was my nightly excursions
          through Japan as my alter ego, Sukuna. The King of Curses himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to all the chaos and interference I've been running in Japan's
          underworld, the name Sukuna was slowly but surely becoming a
          well-known name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Criminals and low-lives feared it, while heroes and the police
          abhorred it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those pesky little heroes and boys in blue sure tried their best to
          catch me, but a quick use of Rabbit Escape left them scratching their
          heads in frustration.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't too sure how <i>they </i>saw the technique; I theorized that
          as the rabbits swarmed around me, their cursed energy had the effect
          of covering me in a sort of CE blanket, causing me to go invisible for
          a brief time. But I wasn't too sure if that was the case. I wasn't a
          normie, after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Back to the Sukuna stuff, going off the way, some hoodlums screamed my
          name in fright as they ran off with their tails between their legs at
          the mere mention of my name. I would say that the name Sukuna was
          quickly becoming a household name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which was great. It was my duty to spread the name of the lord. The
          name Sukuna would be known and praised by all in this world!
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hah-hah! Tactical nuke, incoming! Run! Run like the roaches you are!"
          Twice yelled, and the screen became a hazy yellow when he activated
          the highest kill streak available in the game. Killing everyone in the
          game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, I was able to truly relax whenever I hung out with my bro,
          Twice. I didn't have to act like the responsible, sorta adult with
          him, unlike I did with the others. I could truly sit back and be
          myself when I was with him. A fact that I told him, which caused him
          to fall into silence. He didn't have to say it, but I knew my words
          had touched him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Playing video games, watching movies, and making fun of tourists were
          just some of the few things the two of us did. It was fun and
          relaxing. Unfortunately, the two of us couldn't hang out more than
          just twice a week. I wasn't sure who he rolled with, but they've been
          really busy making big-money moves lately.
        </p>
        <p>
          How did I know it was big money? One look at his vastly improved
          apartment was an easy way to tell.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was no longer a run-down place with little to no furniture. It was
          now full of several personal items and cool stuff. Not to mention the
          sizeable OLED TV he got us to play games on.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the match over and done with, Twice grew uncharacteristically
          silent as he placed his controller down on the coffee table.
        </p>
        <p>"Hm? What's up, Twice? Cat got your tongue?"</p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Twice rubbed the back of his neck for a few seconds before slowly
          taking his mask off. I raised a brow at that as Jin turned to me with
          a regretful look.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Uh, listen, Souta." Jin started. "My... job is getting pretty busy.
          They're going to fly us out to Kyoto for a big job. Yeah... They need
          some more hands to help out with repairs after a big villain attack.
          Yeah... So we won't be able to hang out for a while."
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout our time together, Jin had told me he worked for a
          construction company in charge of repairing the destruction caused by
          villain attacks. At least, that was his cover story. Despite how close
          we've gotten, he couldn't bring himself to tell me what he actually
          did.
        </p>
        <p>I didn't mind it. The guy didn't owe me his secrets after all.</p>
        <p>
          "I see," I grinned at the man and patted his shoulder. "No problem!
          You gotta do what you gotta do to get your bread, my guy. Just let me
          know when you get back, I'll be sure to finally kick your ass in
          Street Fighter."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Jin looked visibly relieved by my reaction and smiled. He nodded at me
          before he quickly slid his mask back on.
        </p>

        <p>
          "You wish, you scrub! Train hard, and I'm sure you'll beat me!" Twice
          said as the next match was about to start.
        </p>
        <p>"Now I'm definitely kicking your ass. Just you wait."</p>
        <p>"You can do it! Dream on!"</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>
          As Nue, Zaiko, and I glided through the vast, inky expanse of the
          night sky, the city below came alive in a dazzling display of
          twinkling lights. Skyscrapers pierced the darkness, their windows
          shining like stars fallen to earth, each flickering light telling a
          story of lives in motion.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air was crisp and cool, brushing against my skin. As Nue banked to
          the left, the iconic Tokyo skyline came into fuller view, silhouetted
          against the darker shades of the night. Neon signs flashed in vibrant
          colors as if winking cheekily at the vastness of the universe above.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hah... I ain't feeling it tonight." I muttered as I laid down on
          Nue's ample back. My jujutsu uniform flapped in the wind as we cut
          through the sky. "Nue, take us home, boy!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Nue roared and banked right towards the direction where my home was
          located. As we flew, my eyelids began to fight me. They were urging me
          to fall asleep to get some much-needed rest. Before I could be seduced
          by lady sleep, several bright flashes of blue popped in the distance.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's that?" I asked while looking at the now fading lights. "Nue."
        </p>
        <p>
          With a powerful flap of its wings, my Shikigami sped off toward where
          the blue lights appeared.
        </p>
        <p>
          After a few short minutes, we came upon an old lonely boat dock. I
          jumped off Nue's back and looked around the eerily silent dock with
          sharp eyes, my Shikigami melting away into the shadows.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air around me was cool and tinged with the salty scent of the
          ocean, mingling with the earthy aroma of damp wood. Silhouetted
          against the star-speckled sky were some nearby boats.
        </p>
        <p>
          A faint breeze whispered through the dock, ruffling the boats' tarps
          and sending ripples across the dark water. Dimly lit lanterns hung
          from the sides of the dock, swaying slightly, their flickering flames
          illuminating sections of the planks with an ethereal glow.
        </p>
        <p>"That smell..."</p>
        <p>
          I turned to the right to see a wide open door swaying in the air that
          led to a large seaside warehouse. My enhanced sense of smell could
          pick up the scent of burnt flesh from within the building.
        </p>
        <p>
          Curiosity took over me, causing me to walk towards the door. As I
          walked, I noted several black scorch marks on the concrete floor
          leading to the warehouse. Passing a glass window, I saw my reflection
          bounce off its surface.
        </p>
        <p>
          While bathed in the shadows of my hood, one could still see the bottom
          half of my face. Adorning my skin were long, sharp black tattoos.
        </p>
        <p>
          These were the tattoos Sukuna had on whenever he took over Yuji or
          Megumi's body or when he was in his original Heian Era body.
        </p>
        <p>How did I have them?</p>
        <p>
          The answer was easy. I had won them as a Gold-tier reward from one of
          my pulls several months back.
        </p>
        <p>The tattoos were purely cosmetic and didn't offer any buffs.</p>
        <p>
          That is unless you consider the boost of aura they gave me a buff.
        </p>
        <p>
          The way the tattoos work is by applying some CE to my skin where they
          were located. Once they had CE flowing through them, they would
          quickly come to life and adorn my skin. After that, I brush back my
          hair and bang! King of Curses look completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While not the greatest reward, it was very cool looking, in my
          opinion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once inside, I moved through the quiet building and found the source
          of the terrible smell.
        </p>
        <p>Lying on the ground were three smoking, charred bodies.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm." I leaned down and placed a hand on one of the corpses to feel
          its warmth. Off to the side was a burnt box with small <i>blue </i>
        </p>

        flames dancing back and forth as they tried to swallow the wood. "Blue
        flames... Dabi?"
        <p></p>
        <p>
          Standing up, I jumped to the building rafters and looked around the
          warehouse. I saw no movement.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking over to the ceiling, I saw an open skylight letting in some
          moonlight. Swinging to it, I jumped onto the roof of the warehouse and
          scanned the roads around the area. There wasn't a soul to be found.
        </p>
        <p>"I must have just missed him."</p>
        <p>
          I sighed in disappointment and raised my hands to resummon Nue. But
          just as I was about to call its name, something fast sliced through
          the air around me.
        </p>
        <p>(Something's coming!) Crow Maki yelled.</p>
        <p><i>Clang!</i></p>
        <p>
          I leaned my upper body back as a white and brown blur sliced the air
          where I once stood. Jumping back, I leaned low and watched as a rather
          short woman slid to a stop several meters away.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"Not bad!"</p>
        <p>
          The woman had tan skin, narrowed red eyes, and long, defined
          eyelashes. She had straight white hair reaching her thighs with bangs
          extending to her face's left side. While slender and curvy, the woman
          also sported a lean, athletic, and well-defined build, especially in
          her arms and legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          She wore a sleeveless white leotard with dark purple trim around her
          shoulders and waist, a wide yellow crescent moon design over her
          chest, and a single thick metal plate wrapped around her midriff. On
          her legs were purple thigh-high boots to compliment her leotard, with
          more plating around the heel and toe areas, making her feet look like
          those of a rabbit.
        </p>
        <p>
          She also has a pair of thick, white gloves on her hands with long
          cuffs, sporting small triangular protrusions around their edges.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Looks like tonight is my lucky night! You're that guy, aren't ya?
          Sukuna, right?" The rabbit-themed woman asked as she eyed me like a
          hungry predator, her strong legs flexing. "I'm here to take you in,
          Villian. We can do this the hard way or the hard-<i>hard </i>way. Take
          your pick."
        </p>
        <p><i>If it isn't the Rabbit hero herself... Mirko.</i></p>
        <p>
          I grinned from underneath the darkness of my hood as I reached into
          Zaiko's mouth to pull out one of my newest weapon additions created by
          my Construction technique, the Ruyi Jingu Bang staff. The woman looked
          momentarily confused at the sudden appearance of my weapon before
          grinning wildly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Looks like we're doing the hard-hard way then. My <i>favorite</i>."

        <p><strong>Next time, Souta vs Rabbit Mommy-I mean Mirko!</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Until next time!</strong></p>

        <h2>Chapter 24: NO. 24 - Sukuna vs. Mirko</h2>
        <p><i>Damn, the unstoppable terminator herself, Mirko. </i></p>
        <p>
          With a fierce cry, Mirko lunged forward, her leg slicing through the
          air like a whip. I pivoted to the side, my Ruyi Jingu Bang staff
          spinning in a blur to block her initial strike. The impact of flesh
          meeting solid tungsten steel echoed through the clearing, sending a
          shockwave up my arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hoh! Not bad! You must be pretty strong to be able to take on one of
          my kicks!" Mirko yelled as she glared at me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hah! If this is all you got, this will be a disappointing fight!" I
          roared back.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+20 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>Mirko's left eye twitched at my provocation, causing me to grin.</p>
        <p>
          In the original series, Mirko, or Usagiyama Rumi, was one of Japan's
          strongest heroes. The woman was an unstoppable force of nature. During
          her fight with the High-Ends, Mirko continued fighting despite losing
          her limbs and getting extremely injured.
        </p>
        <p>
          In other words, she wouldn't stop coming after me unless I knocked her
          out or killed her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Killing her wasn't an option; she had an important role to perform in
          the future, and I didn't want to be labeled as a hero killer either.
        </p>
        <p>
          That and I didn't want to deprive this world of her thunder thighs.
        </p>
        <p>Damn, these teenage hormones...</p>
        <p>
          Using Nue or the insect-like wings from my Construction technique to
          escape would be easy. Mirko had no way of chasing a flying opponent.
          Sure, she could try pursuing me on foot, but she couldn't keep up for
          long.
        </p>
        <p>But I didn't want to run.</p>
        <p>No, I wanted to test myself against her.</p>
        <p>Right here and now.</p>
        <p>
          I wanted to see how my refined martial arts prowess did against an
          actual pro!
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Let's see... I currently have the Ten Shadows, Cloning, Bird
            Manipulation, and Ratio equipped. </i
          >My eyes looked over at the nearby body of water.
          <i>Hmm, Disaster Tides would have made this a breeze. Oh, well.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let's see how pure skill and CE enforcement alone can do first," I
          whispered, my staff held at the ready.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing her move again, I countered by thrusting my staff forward,
          aiming for Mirko's midsection. She ducked low, the golden tip of the
          staff grazing the top of her head as she rolled to the side.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I was hoping I would run into you eventually! Who would have thought
          tonight was my lucky night!" Mirko said with an excited grin. "I'll do
          the police and those weak heroes a favor by taking you down!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Quickly regaining her footing, Mirko launched a flurry of kicks—one
          after another, each kick more powerful than the last. I danced
          backward, my staff twirling defensively before me, deftly deflecting
          her powerful strikes. The rhythmic thuds of her feet against the
          warehouse rooftops reverberated below us as we exchanged blows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Is that so? Try your best then, little Rabbit!" I said with an air of
          arrogance, playing into the role of my namesake.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I had to act it up. Win or lose, after tonight, Japan's pro heroes
          would gain a huge insight into the once-mysterious Sukuna from Mirko.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a sudden burst of speed, Mirko leaped into the air, performing a
          spinning kick.
        </p>
        <p>"Lunar Ring!"</p>

        <p>
          My eyes grew wide seeing her rapid spinning kicks. I instinctively
          reinforced my entire body with CE and raised my staff above my head
          just in time to absorb the impact. The sheer force of her attack
          jolted my arms fiercely, staggering me back.
        </p>
        <p><i>Shit! She's strong!</i></p>
        <p>
          I quickly repositioned myself, using my momentum to swing my staff
          down in a sweeping arc.
        </p>
        <p>"Not bad, little Rabbit! Not bad at all!"</p>
        <p>
          Mirko rolled to avoid the strike, but I had anticipated that. As she
          sprang up, I dashed in and thrust my staff forward, aiming for her
          legs. She expertly jumped over the Ruyi Jingu Bang, the tips of her
          boots barely missing contact. As she landed, Mirko delivered a low
          kick that swept the ground beneath me in an attempt to knock me off
          balance.
        </p>
        <p>"You're pretty good! But it's time to get your ass kicked!"</p>
        <p>
          "Big talk from such a little package," I muttered as I dashed back and
          twisted my staff to keep Mirko at bay.
        </p>
        <p>Mirko's smile grew wide at my comment. "Cocky bastard."</p>
        <p><strong>[+45 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          With a flourish, I thrust my staff out towards her, but the end of my
          staff met nothing but air due to the large space gap between us. Mirko
          laughed at my seemingly pathetic attack.
        </p>
        <p>"Hah! You blind or something!"</p>
        <p>
          "Go forth," I muttered and commanded my staff to <i>extend</i>. "Ruyi
          Jingu Bang!"
        </p>
        <p>
          The rabbit-themed hero's eyes grew wide as my staff exploded towards
          her at incredible speeds. Due to the unexpectedness of the attack, the
          golden end of my Ruyi Jingu Bang collided right into her stomach,
          launching her back to the roof's edge.
        </p>
        <p>"Gah! You B-Bastard!"</p>
        <p>
          The Ruyi Jingu Bang staff, the legendary weapon held by the Great
          Sage, Heaven's Equal, Sun Wukong, was one of the many weapons I
          created with my construction technique over the past two years after
          gaining Tsukumo Yuki's<i> </i>CE reserves.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it was a perfect recreation of Sun Wukong's staff, it didn't
          mean it would hold all of its original properties. To fix that, I
          focused 40% of my daily CE within it and infused my Construction
          technique into the staff from its inception to quickly transform it
          into a cursed tool over the course of a year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Similar to how Nanami infused his blunt sword with his seven to three
          cursed technique, I imbued my Construction technique into my staff to
          grant it the ability to expand, extend, shrink, and retract itself on
          command using CE. The exact same way as Sun Wukong did with his
          original staff.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was nowhere near as powerful as his, but my staff was powerful in
          its own right.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it may not yet be a special grade-level tool just yet, it still
          packed a
          <i>mean </i>punch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mirko looked over at me as I placed my staff over my shoulders with an
          angry expression. I then beckoned her on with a come-on motion.
          Undeterred, she propelled herself forward again.
        </p>
        <p>"Cheap tricks, you Bastard! Take this, Lunar Rush!"</p>
        <p>
          I prepared myself as Mirko unleashed an advanced series of kicks. Her
          legs blurred as they connected with my staff in rapid succession. I
          weaved in and out to avoid the worst of her strikes, using my staff
          both as a shield and a weapon. Each clash of my staff's solid
          CE-enhanced tungsten steel against flesh resonated like thunder in the
          still night.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our grand fight switched from the rooftop of the warehouse down to the
          fishing dock. Wooden planks, crates, poles, and even some of the boats
          all exploded or cracked from being caught up in our battle.
        </p>
        <p><i>She's slowing down. </i></p>
        <p>
          I risked a quick glance at Mirko's legs and saw dark splotches of
          blood spreading through her purple thigh-high boots. The dozens upon
          dozens of impacts against what was quite possibly the strongest piece
          of steel on the planet was having an effect on her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come on, little Rabbit. Don't stop trying! I'll play with you all
          night!" I said with an excited grin as her red eyes met my black ones.
        </p>

        <p><strong>[+50 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry about me. Now that I'm warmed up, the fun can finally
          begin!" Mirko said with a large, battle-hungry smile as she flexed her
          sexy-I mean powerful legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nah, you're done. Your legs are shaking. I'll do you a favor and end
          this now," I said and made a hand sign resembling a snake. "Great
          Serpent."
        </p>
        <p>"Huh? What the hell-"</p>
        <p>
          From below Mirko, a large white snake shot up from the shadows with
          its jaws wide open. Out of sheer, pure instinct, Mirko looked down
          just as my Shinigami was about to bite down into her. She tried to
          jump away from the danger she sensed, but at the last second, her legs
          involuntarily froze on her for a single second.
        </p>
        <p>A second she didn't have the luxury to have wasted.</p>
        <p>
          "What?!" Mirko yelled as she, from her perspective, somehow flew into
          the air, her limbs somehow restricted. Great Serpent had her tightly
          in its jaws but, on my command, avoided piercing her with its sharp
          teeth. "What is this!?"
        </p>
        <p>"Let's fight again someday, Mirko."</p>
        <p>
          Mirko helplessly watched as I shot up toward her with my right arm
          pulled back; my staff was now safely back inside Zaiko. I scanned
          Mirko's body and found the seven-to-three ratio point. Coating my fist
          in CE, I swung forward and struck her at her diaphragm.
        </p>
        <p><i>Ratio!</i></p>
        <p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Mirko's eyes grew white as she gasped loudly in pain as my fist sank
          into her body. While in midair, I dismissed Great Serpent and caught
          the now unconscious hero in my arms. Landing on the ground, I looked
          around the vicinity and found a hidden area. Making my way there, I
          placed Mirko down and adjusted her so she would be in a comfortable
          position.
        </p>
        <p>"Great fight," I said to the unconscious woman and stood up.</p>
        <p>
          Reaching into Zaiko, I pulled out a burner phone to call the police.
          But just as I was about to dial the number, I heard several loud
          sirens heading in my direction.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Oi, Boss.) Crow Maki said as she landed on my shoulder. (Some of
          those costumed losers are heading in this direction.)
        </p>
        <p>"We better get out of here then."</p>
        <p>
          With nothing more to do, I walked over to the warehouse from earlier
          and sank into the shadows.
        </p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>
          Himiko and I were comfortably sprawled on the living room couch, a
          cozy blanket draped over us. The familiar blocky landscape of
          Minecraft filled the television display in front of us. With each
          click of our controllers, we navigated our blocky avatars through lush
          forests and rolling hills, our movements mirroring each other's.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey," Himiko said, playfully placing her foot on my chest as she used
          a pickaxe to mine several blocks of iron. "Aren't you supposed to be
          at school?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah... I guess I should be," I drawled, placing several wood blocks
          down for our ambitious mansion. "But who cares, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, shouldn't you be there?" Himiko slowly said as a skeleton
          walked into her cave, launching arrows at her. "Not that I'm
          complaining."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Man, fuck school. My limbs are too sore for me to bother in going." I
          said as I crafted a wooden door. "Besides, I sent a clone in my place.
          I love that technique."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did I ever tell you your quirk, er, your ability, is broken? Like
          completely." Himiko continued exploring her cave and came upon some
          diamonds beside a stream of lava. "Oooh, diamonds!"
        </p>
        <p>"Heh, it is a bit broken. Ain't it?"</p>
        <p>
          After her first week of living with me, Himiko finally mustered the
          courage to ask about my quirk. Seeing no problem in explaining how my
          abilities worked to her, I described the concept of curse energy. At
          first, she was skeptical, but when I had her try on one of my pairs of
          Maki's specialized glasses, I was able to show her Zaiko and my
          Shikigami.
        </p>
        <p>
          From there, I told her what I was currently capable of. Safe to say,
          Himiko was both amazed and in disbelief at my laundry list of
          abilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was a little worried about revealing the truth to her at first, but
          after a couple of weeks together. Himiko had proven herself to be an
          extremely loyal person.
        </p>
        <p>A very touchy person but still loyal.</p>

        <p>
          After that, telling her what I did at night was easy. That is, without
          all the gruesome and darker things I encountered or did. All she knew
          was that I was some sort of Vigilante. This was an easy sell to her,
          considering the way we first met.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey."</p>
        <p>"Yeah?"</p>
        <p>
          "What do you say about finally meeting some of my friends? What do you
          think?" I looked away from the game and stared at Himiko with a
          genuine smile.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+20 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Himiko looked taken aback and quickly became excited. She placed her
          controller down and crawled over to lay on my chest, her arms around
          my neck.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Really?!" Himiko yelled, seemingly oblivious or uncaring of our
          current situation. "I can finally meet Mei-chan, Keiko-chan, and
          Izuku-kun! You mean it?!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, I think so. Now that you have a better handle on your impulses,
          thanks to the daily doses of blood I give you, I think it should be
          fine." I brushed back her loose blond hair with a smile. "I trust ya."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+40 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Himiko smiled widely with a rosy red blush and shoved her face into my
          chest, causing me to wince.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah, sorry!"</p>
        <p>"I-It's fine."</p>
        <p>
          Himiko hummed and rubbed my chest gently to try and soothe my pain.
        </p>
        <p>"Want some waffles?"</p>
        <p>"...yes."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 25: NO. 25 - A Fun Day Out</h2>
        <p>
          Himiko and I were peacefully walking through the streets of Hamamatsu
          as we made our way to Hatsume's Mechanical Repairs and Such. Looking
          over to the happily skipping girl beside me, I saw how she looked
          around my home city in wonder and excitement.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two of us haven't gone out too often, for obvious reasons, but
          when we did, Himiko thoroughly enjoyed it.
        </p>
        <p>
          She was dressed in a large pastel pink jacket with a white hood that
          hovered over her short white skirt. A pair of white and red sneakers
          were on her feet, while her legs were covered in black thigh-high
          socks. Maki's round glasses and a white medical mask were on her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          The mask was there to try and hide her identity, at least slightly.
        </p>
        <p>"Now remember. Mei can be a bit eccentric."</p>
        <p>"How interesting!"</p>
        <p>
          "Don't get offended if she can't remember your name. It took her weeks
          to remember mine."
        </p>
        <p>"I'll just have to make a super duper strong impression then!"</p>
        <p>"...are you saying I don't?"</p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>
          Seeing that she wouldn't budge, I let the matter go. Himiko's
          excitement at making new friends was too large to be shaken by my
          warnings.
        </p>
        <p>
          It didn't take much longer for us to arrive at the storefront. Once
          there, I held the door open for Himiko, and we walked in. To my
          surprise, I saw Mei's mother, Hatsume Yumiko, behind the counter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yumiko had long black hair and bright green eyes tied into a high
          ponytail. She wore a casual dress with a clean apron around her front.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, Souta-kun!" Yumiko said with a large, motherly smile. "You're
          finally here!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hatsume-san," I said with a slight bow, which Himiko copied. "It's
          nice to see you. It's rare to see you in the storefront. I figured
          you'd be wrangling Mei."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "I tried that. But that girl inherited her father's strength and
          stubbornness. Oh! Who's this cutie? A friend of yours?" Yumiko said as
          she walked around the counter to gush at Himiko, causing the blonde to
          blush. "Your outfit is so cute! I love your glasses!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "A-ah, thank you." Himiko nervously said. She then placed her hands in
          front of her and properly bowed to Yumiko. The ingrained manners
          drilled by her parents kicked in. "I'm... Toga Himiko. It's a pleasure
          to meet you, Hatsume-san."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Our names are so similar! Isn't that a coincidence!" Yumiko gushed as
          she inspected Himiko's signature hair buns. "Did you do your hair
          yourself? I love it! I wish MeiMei would let me style her hair."
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled as I watched Yumiko happily talk to Himiko. Despite being
          thrown off by the woman's bright and motherly personality, Himiko
          quickly regained her cheer. The two then entered a long chat over what
          outfits they thought were cute and how they go about styling their
          hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >I wonder if Himiko was ever able to talk to her own mother like
            this. But knowing how they treated her, probably not. This must be
            new to her.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Unconsciously, my right fist began to tighten in anger. The quick
          snippets I read in the original timeline were just scratches on the
          surface of what Himiko's parents did. I didn't want to think of what
          kind of life she had to live under her parents.
        </p>
        <p>"Let's go, MeiMei! Souta is here!"</p>
        <p>"No! Take me back! This is kidnapping!"</p>
        <p>"I can't kidnap my own kid."</p>
        <p>
          I snapped out of my dark thoughts at the sound of Minato's and Mei's
          loud voices and noticed that my nails had dug into my scarred palms.
          Causing some blood to seep out. I quickly created some bandages with
          my Construction technique and wrapped them around my palm.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You can't imagine how hard it was to get her out of her workshop.
          Don't even get me started on what I had to do to get ready." Minato
          said as he walked into the room with a dressed-up Mei under his arm.
          "Thanks for taking her out, Souta. Gods know she needs some fresh
          air."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's no problem, Hatsume-san," I said as Yumiko and Himiko watched
          Mei struggle to escape from her father's hold.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Souta... how could you?" Mei muttered as she was placed on the
          ground. She was dressed in some casual clothing, which consisted of
          sneakers, jeans, a jacket, black gloves, and steampunk goggles. She
          even had her travel tool set on. "The betrayal! Why would you do this
          to me? I told you I wanted to work on my newest baby today! I even
          invited you to watch me!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "You can't build stuff every day, MeiMei. You need to go outside every
          now and then. Spread your wings. Expand your horizons." Yumiko said
          with a warm smile as she placed her hands on her daughter's shoulders.
          "Go enjoy yourself. Okay, Sweetheart?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Mei looked uncomfortable at her mother's encouragement and nodded
          regretfully. Yumiko always got her to listen somehow. "Okay..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Great!" I said, wrapping an arm behind Himiko's shoulders. "Mei, this
          is Toga Himiko. She's that friend of mine I told you I wanted you to
          meet."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yup! You can call me Himiko! It's nice to meet you, Mei-chan!" Himiko
          jumped toward Mei and grabbed her gloved hands with a large smile.
          "Let's be great friends!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do I have a choice?" Mei said with a defeated sigh, her hands
          twitching as if desperate for tools.
        </p>
        <p>"Nope!" Minato, Yumiko, Himiko, and I all said.</p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>
          The train ride to Musutafu was an annoying one. Himiko wouldn't stop
          asking Mei dozens of questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, this wouldn't get any answers from Mei. But thanks to
          Himiko's acute perception skills, she quickly changed subjects and
          began to ask Mei about her inventions. Now, THAT got the pink-haired
          inventor otaku to talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          "...and then I used a different type of polymer, which ended up doing
          the trick! You should have seen my baby! It was amazing!" Mei said
          excitedly as she showed Himiko several photos on her smartphone.

        <p>
          Her loud and crazed energy caused some of the nearby train folk to
          stare at her in annoyance. A well-dressed man had an irritated look on
          his face and was about to tell Mei off when I suddenly stepped between
          them and <i>smiled</i> at him. He swallowed whatever comment he had
          and slithered away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wow! You sure are super smart, Mei-chan! Tell me, tell me, how did
          you come up with this baby's design?"
        </p>
        <p>"I'm glad you asked, cat-eyes! You see, I..."</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Damn, Himiko moves quickly. She's already on a personal-features
            name base. Soon enough, Mei will actually remember her name.</i

        </p>
        <p>
          I sighed at the unfairness of it all and looked outside the windows at
          the speeding buildings as they blurred by. I felt a buzz in my pocket
          and pulled out my phone. It was a message from Keiko.
        </p>
        <p>
          [Keiko: Izuku-kun and I are here! Let me know when you all are almost
          here!]
        </p>
        <p>
          I responded by saying it shouldn't be much longer. Sending my message,
          I put my phone away and continued to listen to the two chattering
          girls. A small smile grew on my face as I watched the two enjoy
          themselves in their conversation.
        </p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>"It's nice to meet you! I'm Hase Keiko!"</p>
        <p>"Oh, I'm Midoriya Izuku. It's nice to meet you two."</p>
        <p>
          "I'm Toga Himiko! But you all can call me Himiko! I'm so happy to meet
          Suk- <i>Souta-kun's</i> friends!"
        </p>
        <p>"..."</p>
        <p>
          I reached out and lifted Mei's chin up from the small metal box she
          snuck with her, causing her to realize where she was.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh. Remember this name! I'm Japan's- no! The
          <i>world's future </i>leading genius in all things support gear and
          innovations! Hatsume Mei!" Mei said with no shame as she placed her
          fists on her hips.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, she's exactly like you said she would be." Keiko said as she and
          Izuku walked over to us. Creating a group of five. She then turned to
          Himiko and smiled. "Souchan has told me that you're a great cook,
          Himiko-chan. We should swap some recipes!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko's eyes glowed with glee as she nodded eagerly. "I'd love to!
          Oh! We should all swap numbers! You too, Izuku-kun!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "H-huh?! Me too?!" Izuku blushed in embarrassment from beside me. I
          blinked as his shirt had the words <i>Dress Shirt</i>. "O-okay!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bro, you need to calm down." I placed an arm around Izuku's shoulder
          and motioned to Himiko, who was happily exchanging numbers with Keiko
          and Mei. The latter didn't exactly know why Himiko took her phone as
          she tinkered with her small box. "Himiko won't bite... I think."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"Huh?"</p>
        <p>
          "Okay!" I stepped forward and clapped my hands. "Let's get this show
          on the road, everyone! We have a city to burn!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Right!" Kieko and Himiko pumped their hands in the air with excited
          grins.
        </p>
        <p>
          "We are? Tch. I forgot to bring my flamethrower then." Mei muttered as
          she looked over at me from her small project. "That's okay! I'll
          fashion up a new one in no time!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Bet." I said as we all began walking down the sidewalk toward the
          local shopping mall.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Izuku blinked in concern as he stayed in place while we all walked
          off.
        </p>
        <p>"That was a joke... right?"</p>
        <p>"Let's go, Izuku!"</p>
        <p>"Ah! Coming!"</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>
          The hustle and bustle of the mall filled our ears as we navigated
          through the crowded aisles, laughter and chatter filling the air.
          Bright lights bounced off the polished floors, illuminating the
          colorful storefronts that lined either side of the wide corridor.
          Seeing what apparently was a cute-looking dress, Himiko and Keiko
          dragged us all into a chic boutique.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Come on, you guys! You have to see this dress!" Keiko exclaimed,
          holding up a vibrant blue sundress that seemed like any other to me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh! You should try it on!" Himiko teased as she held up a pink skirt.
          "So cute! I want to try this on!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You should! I know you'll rock it!" Keiko replied with a bright
          smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Awe, Really?!" Himiko blushed as she held the skirt tightly. She then
          looked over to see a black denim jacket. "Oh! That jacket would look
          great on Mei-chan!"
        </p>
        <div id="pf-1778-1">

            });
          </script>
        </div>
        <p>
          "Hm?" Mei looked up from where I was holding her shoulder in order to
          stop her from wandering off. "No thank-" Before she could finish,
          Himiko and Keiko grabbed her wrists and pulled the pink-haired
          inventor off to the changing room.
        </p>
        <p>"Souta! Help! I'm being taken!"</p>
        <p>"I'll remember you fondly, Mei."</p>
        <p>"Souta!"</p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          After that, Izuku and I ambled over to the store's shoe section. Izuku
          sighed as he turned to me with a shaky grin.
        </p>
        <p>"Man, girls can be pretty scary."</p>
        <p>
          "True," I muttered as I raised a pair of grey and black sneakers.
          "What do you think of these?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, I think they're really cool," Izuku replied as he looked over at
          a pair of very familiar sneakers on display. "Wow, those look
          impressive."
        </p>
        <p>"Dude, those are literally the same shoes you're wearing."</p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"Are they? Hmm."</p>
        <p>
          The girls, and a reluctant Mei, continued browsing and trying on their
          outfit picks for another hour and a half. Sometime during their mini
          fashion show, Mei had snuck away from them and found refuge with Izuku
          and me on a bench. I then promptly received two smacks on the head
          from Mei.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once Himiko and Keiko were somewhat satisfied, we all decided to take
          a break at the food court to grab a bite to eat...
        </p>
        <p>
          "The hell do you mean you don't think Godzillo can beat All Might?" I
          slammed my fist on our table and pointed my chopsticks at Izuku, who
          looked uncharacteristically confident. "Such blasphemy. All Might's a
          scrub next to the King of the Monsters!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[10 x 4 = +40 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Souta-san, I'm sorry, but you're wrong," Izuku said. "All Might is
          Japan's number one hero! The world's strongest hero! While I do think
          Godzillo is an amazing hero, All Might is on a completely different
          level."
        </p>
        <p>
          "You damn fanboy. This is the thanks I get after raising you as one of
          my own." I stood up and walked around the girls, who were watching us
          in interest as they drank their milk tea. "I won't take this
          disrespect lying down. I'll put you down, Boy! Say it! Say that All
          Might ain't shit next to Godzillo! Say it!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Geh... I-I won't!" Izuku stood up and stared me straight in the eyes.
          "All Might is the best hero ever! I won't back down, not even from you
          Souta-san!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I grit my teeth as my fists clenched tightly. "Damn... to think you've
          grown so much to the point of standing up to me. I see you've grown a
          little... Very well, I'll let this slide." I placed a hand on his
          shoulder and smiled at him. "I'm proud of you, Izuku."
        </p>
        <p>"Souta-san..."</p>
        <p><strong>[10 x 4 = +40 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>Keiko, Himiko, and even Mei turned to one another in confusion.</p>
        <p>"What just happened?" Mei asked as she tilted her head.</p>
        <p>
          Keiko shrugged as she sipped on her drink. "I don't know. I stopped
          trying to make sense of what Sou-chan does or says after we turned
          six."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm, this must be a guy thing then," Himiko said as she held a finger
          on her chin. "Very interesting."
        </p>

          After a few more hours of wasting time and messing around at the mall,
          we all agreed to go watch a movie at a nearby theater.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[Total SP: 8,619]</strong></p>
        <p>
          <i>Man, today has been a treasure trove of points.</i> I smiled over
          at my group of friends as they bickered over what movie we should
          watch.<i>
            Then again, I have been saving my points up for a wild gambling
            night.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          Izuku and Keiko tried to get everyone to watch the newest superhero
          movie. At the same time, Mei wanted to watch a documentary on the
          hundred years of innovation of hero support items. Himiko was trying
          to convince everyone to watch a horror movie.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was more than happy to let them figure out how we were going to
          waste two hours from the comfort of this cushioned seat I sat on.
          Leaning back, I looked around at the busy movie theater lobby, where
          several people ambled about.
        </p>
        <p>"That's her. Isn't it?"</p>
        <p>"Yeah. She fits the description."</p>
        <p>
          I turned to see three police officers walk through the theater's main
          entrance. They had steady and determined looks on their faces as they
          headed straight towards my group of friends. Specifically, towards
          Himiko.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, shit." I stood up and made two hand signs. My twin divine dogs
          and several rabbits rose from my shadows. "Go warn, Himiko."
        </p>
        <p>
          My Devine dogs nodded and ran off towards her. Thanks to Himiko
          wearing Maki's glasses, which let her see my Shinigami's, Himiko
          quickly saw my divine dogs and rabbits. The dogs pawed at her leg and
          turned to the police. Her eyes grew wide in fear before she quickly
          slipped on her medical mask.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A-ah, I'm sorry! I have to go home! Something important came up!"
          Himiko abruptly said as she dashed away from the confused group.
        </p>
        <p>"Toga-san?" Izuku said as Mei watched in confusion.</p>
        <p>
          "Himiko-chan? What's wrong?!" Keiko called out, but Himiko was already
          gone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing her run, the officers sped up but didn't run after her in order
          not to raise a panic in the public.

        <p>"Alright, let's do this."</p>
        <p>
          Cracking my neck, I walked over to a distracted couple and snatched
          one of their coffees and napkins from their table.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a hot cup of coffee in hand, I headed straight at the police
          officers and <i>accidentally</i> crashed into one of them.<i
          > </i>Spilling hot coffee all over his chest and face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gah!" The officer cried out in pain as he quickly tried to rub off
          the coffee from his face.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "I am so, so sorry! I just spilled a very hot liquid all over your
          face." I yelled as I tried to help the officer by patting his clothes
          with my napkin. I dabbed his face, chest, and, finally, legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was at it, I winked at my rabbits, launching them into action.
          Two of the rabbits rushed over to the officer I was patting and
          quickly tied their shoelaces together.
        </p>
        <p>
          As they got to work, I quickly lowered myself and extended my leg,
          causing the second incoming officer to trip and fall.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whoa there! I didn't see you!" I cried out with a spin, spilling all
          of the remaining coffee into the third and final officer's face.
          Causing him to scream and grab his face in pain. "Here, let me help
          you!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I reached over to a nearby table and ripped off its tablecloth,
          leaving all of the contents on top of the table in place. I wrapped
          the tablecloth around the third officer's head, blinding him as my
          rabbits tied his laces together.
        </p>
        <p>
          Moving over to the fallen officer, I winked at my rabbits as they
          finished tying his laces as well. They gave me a thumbs-up and melted
          into the shadows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Officer! Officer! Let me help you!" As I moved to help the fallen
          officer, I ended up tripping on nothing, causing me to fall over him.
          "Gah! I'm so clumsy! I'm all thumbs today."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[5 x 3 = +15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"Get out of the way kid!"</p>
        <p>
          The officers glared at me and tried to run where they had last seen
          Himiko go, but they all ended up tripping due to their tied shoelaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Can't believe that worked," I muttered as I walked away from the
          struggling officers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Reaching the others, I saw that they were too worried about Himiko's
          disappearance to have seen my performance. How sad.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey, guys. What's up?" I asked them. I then looked around with a look
          of suspicion. "Where's Himiko?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sou-chan!" Keiko cried out as she grabbed one of my jacket sleeves.
          "Himiko-chan suddenly left! I tried to call her, but she won't pick
          up. I'm worried about her! She looked really scared."
        </p>
        <p>
          "We have to go after her. What if she's in some kind of trouble?"
          Izuku said with a concerned expression while Mei nodded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay, Let's go after her, then," I said as I looked over my shoulder
          to see the confused officers scanning the lobby. "Let's get moving."
        </p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>"There you are."</p>
        <p>
          I walked over to Himiko as she sat on the rooftop of my house with her
          knees against her chest. Sitting down next to her, I looked out at the
          dark star-filled night sky. A soft hiccup escaped Himiko as she buried
          her head into her knees.
        </p>
        <p>"I was having so much fun."</p>
        <p>"...I know."</p>
        <p>
          I wrapped my arms around her as she leaned her head into my chest. Her
          sobs shook my chest as she cried.
        </p>
        <p>
          "They were worried about you, you know. They didn't give up looking
          for you until I forced them to stop." I whispered as I rubbed her left
          arm. "You made some really good friends, Himiko. There will be a lot
          more opportunities for you to hang out with them."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "It'll just happen again... They'll keep looking for me." Himiko said
          as she looked up at me with tears streaming down her face. "It's not
          fair... I don't want to live like this... I just want to be
          <i>free</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          I said nothing but pulled her in tighter as she continued to cry into
          my chest. A cold feeling swelled in my chest as I brushed her hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't worry, Himiko. You will be... I <strong><i>promise</i></strong

        <h2>Chapter 26: NO. 26 - The Ends Justify The Means?</h2>
        <p>
          The Reverse Cursed Technique, a rare and exclusive ability in the
          world of Jujutsu Kaisen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process of turning negative energy into positive energy is simple
          in theory.
        </p>
        <p>
          A negative multiplied by another negative creates a positive. That
          should mean that I should be able to multiply my cursed energy by
          itself to create reversed cursed energy.
        </p>
        <p>Sadly, it wasn't that simple.</p>
        <p>
          Reversed Cursed Energy, or RCT, is mainly used to heal oneself or
          another. The latter is much harder to do, considering only three
          characters could do so in JJK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Those being Shoko, Yuta, and Sukuna. Not even the strongest sorcerer
          of the modern era, Gojo Satoru, could heal someone else with his RCT.
        </p>
        <p>
          RCT is capable of healing large wounds, poison effects, or even
          healing an entire lost limb's back. Thus making having the RCT in your
          arsenal a massive boon.
        </p>
        <p>There was also another bonus effect of the RCT besides healing.</p>
        <p>
          That is the ability to fuel one's cursed technique with positive
          energy to create its reversal. Gojo's Reversal: Red is a prime
          example.
        </p>
        <p>
          The only caveat of RCT is its formidable complexity. It's incredibly
          hard to use and understand, a challenge that only a handful of jujutsu
          sorcerers in JJK have managed to overcome. Those sorcerers were either
          geniuses or extremely talented at jujutsu.
        </p>
        <p>
          The skill ceiling on this technique was practically among the stars,
          considering that I've failed to grasp how to use it over the past six
          years. Not even the boost of CE understanding granted to me from a
          Black Flash helped me get any closer to understanding the core of
          cursed energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I really hope I don't have to be nearly killed like Gojo to
          understand RCT. Even then, I doubt it's a guaranteed skill to learn
          when I'm bleeding out."
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing atop the rooftop of an old building in my jujutsu uniform, I
          leaned against the gritty concrete, letting the cool evening air wash
          over me. Before me sprawled the city of Osaka, its skyline punctuated
          by a blend of sleek glass towers and aged brick structures, each one
          telling a story of its own.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cars raced along the avenues, their headlights streaking past like
          shooting stars against the darkness. I could hear the distant echoes
          of laughter and conversation, hints of life woven into the fabric of
          the night. The aromas of street food wafted up, teasing my senses with
          the promise of adventure and indulgence.
        </p>
        <p>"There he is."</p>
        <p>
          I looked down at a lone male student with black, unkempt hair. He had
          a striking resemblance to Izuku that one wouldn't be remiss in
          assuming Hasashi cheated on Inko. He was dressed in an
          expensive-looking school uniform as he walked down the lone street
          towards his home.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hello there, Saito," I muttered as my black tattoos burned to life.
          Brushing my hair back, I grinned at the unsuspecting student. "About
          time you showed up."
        </p>
        <p>
          I raised my hands, fingers spread, placing one in front of the other
          while my thumbs hooked on one another.
        </p>
        <p>"Nue."</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Yes, Mom. I'm fine. Just a little tired," Saito said as he spoke on
          his phone. "I should be home in a few minutes, okay? Alright, see you
          soon."
        </p>
        <p>
          Slipping his phone into his pocket, Saito jumped as a deafening roar
          echoed around him. Saito turned with his heart racing in his chest,
          just in time to see a shadowy form swoop down from the darkening sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          'W-what was that!?' Saito thought as he looked around the sky in
          fright. 'A Villian?!'
        </p>
        <p>
          Before he could scream or run, thick, a tight pressure latched onto
          his shoulders, lifting him effortlessly into the air. Panic surged
          through Saito as he dangled high above the ground from the invisible
          force, his home city sprawling like a patchwork quilt below.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Saito, right?" A sudden voice said from above, causing Saito to look
          up and see a hooded figure somehow standing in thin air above as they
          flew through the sky.
        </p>

        <p>
          "W-who are you?! What is this?!" Saito's yells pierced the blowing
          winds as he thrashed and kicked, but whatever was holding him had an
          ironclad grip.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sukuna grinned at Saito but remained silent. Saito yelled in fright as
          they jerked upwards into the air. They grew higher and higher, up
          until the point that the city below seemed so small.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh god... Oh god!" Saito muttered in terror as his body came to a
          stop in place in the sky. "So high! I'm going to die!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Heh, don't worry. You won't die." Sukuna said as she looked down at
          Saito with a grin. "That is if you do as I say."
        </p>
        <p>"W-what do you want?"</p>
        <p>
          "It's simple really. A month and a half ago, a girl named Toga Himiko
          stabbed you and drank your blood. Allegedly," Sakuna said as his voice
          turned cold and uncaring, a far cry from the playful tone he had
          before. "You're going to drop all charges against her, and you're
          going to tell the police that
          <i>you</i> attacked her. Acting in self-defense, she defended herself
          with a boxcutter she found on the ground. There was a struggle, and
          you ended up stabbed. Toga then tried to help you, but it was
          misinterpreted as her drinking your blood by a scared and confused
          onlooker."
        </p>
        <p>"What!? That's not what happened! That psycho-"</p>
        <p>
          Saito was interrupted when his left shoulder was suddenly released,
          causing him to yell as he swung around from solely his right shoulder.
          His old stab wound burned to life, sending pain through his chest.
          Saito's eyes turned down to the city below, and fear began to squeeze
          his throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't drop me! Help!" Saito screamed as tears streamed from his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Tell me, Saito. What happened that day you were stabbed," Sukuna said
          coldly with his hands in his pockets. "I suggest you be
          <i>honest</i>."
        </p>
        <p>Saito's eyes grew wide and finally closed with resignation.</p>
        <p>
          "I-I... I attacked Toga-san... she was scared and defended herself.
          She s-stabbed me in self-defense. It was my fault. Not hers!
          Sa-Sayaka-chan was confused about what she saw that day... Toga-san
          was trying to help me. Not d-drink my blood. That's what h-happened."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good, very good. Now that your memory has been refreshed, I suggest
          you talk to the Detective in charge of your case and enlighten him
          about what actually happened. Is that understood?" Sukuna said as
          Saito felt the invisible force on his right shoulder began to loosen.
        </p>
        <p>"Yes! Yes, I understand!"</p>
        <p>
          "Excellent. Oh, and Saito." Sukuna leaned down to peer at Saito with a
          steady gaze. "Don't think about telling anyone about this or going
          back on your word. Because I will find you and your family. Trust me,
          you don't want that to happen."
        </p>
        <p>
          Saito looked away from Sukuna's terrifying, cold eyes and nodded. His
          cries overtook his ability to speak correctly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'm glad you understand. Now, let me take you home. I'm sure you
          don't want to keep that dear mother and that sweat little brother of
          yours waiting." Sukuna said as they began flying through the now night
          sky. "Don't worry about Sayaka; her story will match yours.
          <i>Trust me</i>."

        <p>
          Detective Ige Yoichi slumped into his worn-out armchair, the kind that
          had molded to his body over the years. His grey hair, once full, was
          beginning to thin at the temples. His once-bright eyes now seem
          dulled, with dark circles forming beneath them as he looked around his
          home.
        </p>
        <p>
          The faint light from the streetlamp outside cast long shadows in the
          dimly lit living room, where the clock ticked away in a steady rhythm.
          Yoichi's coat was crumpled on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          He surveyed the room, a mix of unwashed coffee mugs and scattered case
          files cluttering the coffee table, each one a testament to the
          relentless grind of his job. The harsh memories of the day – crime
          scenes that haunted him, the grief-stricken faces of victims' families
          – flickered through his thoughts like an old film reel. He sighed,
          rubbing the back of his neck, trying to ease the tension coiled there.
        </p>

          Standing up, Yoichi passed his coffee table, where several past-due
          medical bills sat alongside a framed picture. The picture was of
          Yoichi, a brown-haired woman, and a little girl hugging a teddy bear.
          The picture was what one could call the perfect family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stepping out to his balcony, Yoichi pulled out a box of cigars and
          slid out a stick. Lighting it with a small, engraved lighter. Yoichi
          placed the cigarette in his mouth and took a long drag.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each minute felt like an hour, each hour a lifetime. Yoichi recalled
          the nights they used to spend together, reading his daughter her
          favorite stories as she snuggled close, her giggles echoing through
          the house.
        </p>

        <p>
          Now, all he could do was pray for her recovery, reliving moments of
          joy that seemed so distant now. Thinking of his sick daughter, Yoichi
          felt a growing headache.
        </p>
        <p>
          'What if the doctors couldn't find the right treatment? What if... no,
          I can't let myself think that way.' Yoichi thought as he rubbed the
          bridge of his nose.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having finished his current cigarette, Yoichi pulled out another. Just
          as he was about to light it on, the lights within his house turned
          off. Looking over his shoulder through his glass sliding door, Yoichi
          froze. He then took a deep breath to calm himself and walked inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Calm down. I must have forgotten to pay the electric bill.' Yoichi
          thought as he walked over to the light switch on the wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flipping it, he froze when he saw a hooded figure sitting on his
          recliner, the framed picture of his long-dead wife and daughter in his
          gloved hand. Glancing over where he left his service weapon, Yoichi
          began to slowly slide over to it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't," Sukuna said as he placed the frame down on the recliner's
          armrest. "You'll be dead before you get anywhere close."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who are you?" Yoichi hissed, his nerves firing. Despite his fear, he
          kept himself calm. His decade's worth of police experience kicked in.
          "What are you doing in my home?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Sukuna ignored him in favor of lifting up one of his newest case
          files. Yoichi recognized it immediately; it was the Toga family case.
          "I'm here to talk to you about this. You will come upon a sudden
          breakthrough with the case tomorrow. Shuji Saito and Emiko Sayaka can
          no longer continue the lie, and they will finally tell the truth about
          what happened that night when young Saito attacked Toga Himiko. I
          believe their confessions will finally close the case."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoichi swallowed the built-up saliva in his mouth, his face covered in
          a nervous sweat. "What have you done to those children?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Me? Oh, nothing. Nothing at all. I merely suggested they come clean.
          Embrace the truth." Sukuna said as he rose to his feet. Yoichi noticed
          the black tattoos on his lower face. "Your job, Detective, is to use
          their confessions to clear Toga Himiko's name. Drop all of the
          criminal charges on her."
        </p>
        <p>
          "...you're asking me to twist the truth. Cover Toga Himiko's crimes."
          Yoichi grits out, his hands clenched into fists. "I refuse."
        </p>
        <p>
          Sukuna grinned at his response as if expecting it. He then reached
          into his jacket pocket and brought a smartphone. On the screen was a
          video. A live video. Yoichi's eyes slowly grew wide in terror as he
          saw the live feed on the phone.
        </p>
        <p>
          The video was of someone recording his sleeping daughter in her
          hospital room from outside her private room. The video then shifted to
          show a masked person looking down at the camera before moving back to
          the young, sick girl.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This is your daughter, right? I'm sorry to hear about the cancer.
          It's just not fair." Sukuna said as he tossed the phone at Yoichi. The
          man quickly caught the device, his face contorted in fear and worry.
          "Kyushu University Hospital. A very good hospital. A very
          <i>expensive</i> hospital." Sukuna walked over to the coffee shop
          where several unpaid bills were sitting. He then threw down a photo of
          Yoichi talking to several tattooed men. "Now, why would a highly
          decorated detective like yourself be seen talking to the local
          Yakuza?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "...I borrowed money from them," Yoichi said in defeat as he slowly
          fell to his knees. "I was there to pay off some of my debt."
        </p>
        <p><i>Slam!</i></p>
        <p>
          Yoichi jumped when a black duffle bag full of several stacks of
          10,000-dollar yen bills was dropped on his coffee table.
        </p>
        <p>
          "There. Your debt is paid." Sukuna said as he looked over at Yoichi.
          "There will even be enough left to pay off those pesky hospital bills
          for your little girl. Maybe even some for her university tuition."
        </p>
        <p>"...why are you doing this?"</p>
        <p>
          Sukuna said nothing and walked over to stand beside Yoichi. Sukuna
          then grabbed the top of his hood and pulled it back to reveal his
          young, tattooed face.
        </p>
        <p>"You know who I am?"</p>
        <p>
          "...yes. Those tattoos. Those clothes... You're <i>him</i>. You're
          Sukuna."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Correct. You do know what me showing you my face means, don't you?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoichi looked away from Sukuna's cold, expressionless face and nodded.
        </p>
        <p>
          The seasoned Detective knew what Sukuna was implying. Now that he knew
          what he looked like, Yoichi and, by extension, his daughter's lives
          now belonged in the hands of this competent and dangerous individual.
        </p>

        <p>Detective Ige Yoichi was now in Sukuna's pocket.</p>
        <p>"...I do."</p>
        <p>"Good. Now, here's what you're going to do for me."</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[Shimizu Souta POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I slid down a brick wall in some dirty alleyway with a groan. I yanked
          my hood off my head as my tattoos melted away. I rubbed my eyes with
          the back of my forearm and let out a long sigh.
        </p>
        <p>"Damn, that was harder than I thought."</p>
        <p>
          I, of course, had no real intentions of hurting any of the people I
          threatened tonight. It was all a big bluff in the guise of the threat
          of bloody murder.
        </p>
        <p>Yes, a bluff...</p>
        <p>
          While I may have gone a bit overboard with Saito, my whole plan relied
          on him following through. His confession was pivotal for the case to
          be thrown out to ensure Himiko's freedom. While I did feel a bit bad
          about turning him into the attacker and possibly ruining his life, I
          quickly didn't care.
        </p>
        <p>Himiko came first.</p>
        <p>That meant I had to put the fear of god into him.</p>
        <p>
          When it came to threatening Sayaka, the girl who witnessed Himiko
          drinking from Saito like a cup of juice, I kinda ended up making her
          cry. Like a lot. Damn girl was an ugly cryer. But at least I knew she
          wouldn't talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Threatening to burn her house down with her and her family inside was
          rather effective.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was worried things were going to get dicey when it came to the
          Detective, thankfully, my carefully crafted plan worked to get him in
          my back pocket.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, it cost me a bag of cash and beating up a crew of Yukuza, but it
          was a long-term investment. He would be my prime source of information
          when it came to the police or any ongoing investigations with the
          heroes.
        </p>
        <p>Hopefully, my money would help his kid...</p>
        <p>Oh, look. I <i>do</i> have a heart.</p>
        <p>As insurance, I had a crow watching each of them just to be safe.</p>
        <p>
          Despite not completely agreeing with my evil methods, I couldn't
          disagree that they were effective in getting my chess pieces to move
          where I wanted them to. The only piece left was to take down the king
          piece.
        </p>
        <p>The king piece being Himiko's parents.</p>
        <p>
          This time, however, I was rather excited about threatening them.
          Depending on how they reacted, I wouldn't be opposed to actually going
          through with my threats.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then..." I pulled out my phone and looked up the Toga family
          name. "Where to start."

        <h2>Chapter 27: NO. 27 - Mind Shift</h2>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Toga Kazuhito adjusted his tie as he stepped out of the love hotel
          behind him, ready to make the journey home now that some of his stress
          had been relieved. The dark bustling streets were alive with the
          sounds of honking horns, chattering pedestrians, and the distant
          strains of music wafting from nearby cafes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kazuhito was a man in his late forties with dark blonde hair and
          yellow eyes. He had an angular face with droopy, tired eyes. The man
          was dressed in his business attire while a suitcase swung back and
          forth in his hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          He navigated through the throngs of people, his briefcase swinging
          lightly at his side. The aroma of street food filled the air, from
          sizzling ramen to sweet street desserts, tempting him to pause and
          indulge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exactly like he did with the whore he hired on a weekly bases. A habit
          he picked up ever since that <i>monster </i>did what she did. Ruining
          his family name.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kazuhito's mind traveled back in time to when the demon that was once
          his daughter was once his sweet little girl. However, it all changed
          when he and his wife saw her holding a bleeding bird with a large,
          evil smile. It was then that he realized her true nature.
        </p>
        <p>
          'Why? Why did I help give birth to a thing like that?' Kazuhito
          thought as he rubbed his tired face. 'Why couldn't she have been like
          her brother or sister?'
        </p>
        <p>
          As he strolled along the crowded sidewalks, Kazuhito took in the
          sights of the city that once seemed so vibrant. Now, it was colorless
          and dull before his eyes. The muffled sounds of distant traffic faded
          as he turned into a dimly lit alley, seeking a shortcut to his car.
          Entering the parking lot where his car was located, Kazuhito reached
          into his pocket for his car keys.
        </p>
        <p>Suddenly, his nose twitched as he sensed a presence behind him.</p>
        <p>
          This was thanks to his quirk, which was called Blood Radar. His quirk
          allowed him to feel the presence of anyone with blood. However, it was
          rather weak and only expanded out to 2.5 meters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Turning around, Kazuhito looked around at the empty parking lot with
          confusion.
        </p>
        <p>"Did I imagine it?" Kazuhito muttered.</p>
        <p>
          An unnerving silence fell over the parking lot; not even the constant
          sounds of the bustling city could be heard. Out of nowhere, the sound
          of approaching footsteps filled the once-quiet air. Before Kazuhito
          could react, a pair of strong hands grabbed him, pulling him into the
          darkness.
        </p>
        <p>
          Panic surged through him as he struggled against their incredibly
          strong grip. But before he could yell for help, a cold liquid material
          slithered over his mouth before solidifying. Silencing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          He caught a glimpse of the figure above him—It was a black hooded
          individual dressed in a white, high-collar shirt. But what caught
          Kazuhito's eyes were the tattoos on his attacker's face.
        </p>
        <p>That and the large, bloodthirsty smile on his face.</p>
        <p>
          Kazuhito's heart raced; he had no idea what the hooded figure wanted.
          All he knew was that this individual was much stronger than him.
          Despite that, Kazuhito tried his best to escape their hold before a
          heavy blow landed on the side of his head.
        </p>
        <p>
          As his consciousness left him, Kazuhito heard the figure finally
          speak.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Be sure to wake up soon, Toga-<i>san</i>," Sukuna said mockingly.
          "You and I have a lot to <i>talk </i>about."
        </p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[Shimizu Souta POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          The room I stood in loomed large, an expanse of faded shadows that
          seem to stretch endlessly. The high ceiling was lost in the darkness,
          where cobwebs hang like tattered curtains, swaying slightly with the
          occasional draft. The air is thick and stale, carrying a musty odor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walls painted a once-bright color are now dulled by time, are cracked
          and peeling, and reveal the bare, rough stone beneath. In one corner,
          an old wooden chair stands as a solitary piece of furniture, its
          surface scratched and splintered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flickering light from a solitary overhead bulb casts erratic shadows
          across the floor, where dust particles swirl like tiny ghosts caught
          in a dance. The floorboards creaked ominously underfoot as I stepped
          up to the sleeping man.
        </p>
        <p><i>Smack!</i></p>
        <p>
          "Wake up already," I said as I watched Himiko's dad wake up from his
          little nap.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          He blinked as he shook his head, eyes blinking in confusion. Kazuhito
          tried to move, but the fact that I tied his arms and legs to a rickety
          old steel chair made it an impossible task.
        </p>
        <p>"Where-"</p>
        <p><i>Smack!</i></p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I slapped the blonde man again, interrupting his dumb question.
          Kazuhito grunted and spat out some blood onto the dirty floor from the
          force of my slap. He turned to me with fear in his eyes as I stood
          still and continued to stare at him.
        </p>
        <p>There were no words.</p>
        <p>No sounds made between us.</p>
        <p>Just silence.</p>
        <p>
          Gus Fring, Walter White, Anton Chigurh, Tywin Lannister, and many more
          were the characters I channeled for the more sinister parts of
          Sukuna's personality I used during my nightly escapades. Who knew
          wasting so many hours of my past life watching so many movies and TV
          shows would come in so handy?
        </p>
        <p>"P-Please, I have a wife and children-"</p>
        <p><i>Smack!</i></p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "How funny," I said in a low voice. "An unfaithful cheating husband
          who called one of his children a demon and threw her away at the first
          sign of trouble is using his family to bargain for his life. Don't you
          think it's <i>funny</i>?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The tied-up Toga patriarch looked down at his bare feet, his eyes
          tearing up. Seeing this caused me to glare at the man. "What... do you
          want from me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked behind the man where one of my toad Shikigami sat, nodding;
          the toad shot out its tongue and wrapped it around Kazuhito's throat.
          The man grunted as he was pulled back to the point where the chair he
          sat on tettered back and forth from its back legs. Kazuhito looked
          around in fear as he tried to maintain the chair's balance from
          whatever invisible force was holding him. His breathing was starting
          to become labored as my toads tongue slowly began to tighten.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't want anything from you, you failure of a father." I walked
          over to stand beside the man, my hands in my pockets. "But I do want
          you to do something for your daughter, Toga Himiko."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Kazuhito's eyes grew wide in realization. The fear he once had in his
          eyes turned to shock and then anger, causing his already red face to
          become a bright crimson.
        </p>
        <p>
          "She did this, didn't she? She hired you to do this to me!" Kazuhito
          yelled with a red face, the pressure around his neck forgotten. "That
          damn Demon! I knew I should have-"
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong><i>Smack!</i></strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>For the first time in several years, I felt anger rise within me.</p>
        <p>
          To see what should have been Himiko's loving father yelling out her
          name as a curse caused me to grow cold. I was extremely tempted to put
          the man down like the rest of those rabid dogs I've encountered.
        </p>
        <p>It would be so easy... just one quick twist of my wrist.</p>
        <p>
          But I controlled myself, even if this human trash deserved to die in
          my eyes.
        </p>
        <p>He was still Himiko's father.</p>

        <p>And I didn't want to hurt my friend by killing her father.</p>
        <p>
          "Say another word about her, and I'll show you what an actual Demon
          looks like. Do you understand?" As I spoke, I had several blood
          tendrils slither out of my back. Their sharp ends slithered close to
          Kazuhito's face, ready to slice him to shreds. "That <i>clear?</i>"
        </p>
        <p>
          The blonde man's terrified eyes watched the sharp blood tendrils dance
          around in the air. With a quick nod, the man closed his eyes as if
          that would save him from his fate.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"C-crystal."</p>
        <p>"Good. Very good."</p>
        <p>
          With a silent command, my toad Shinigami released Kazuhito, causing
          the man to cough and for his chair to land on all fours. I ignored the
          frightened man and retracted my blood back into me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Your daughter will soon be cleared of all her alleged crimes," I said
          calmly, my words sending a look of disbelief on Kazuhito's face. "Any
          and all charges against her will be dropped, and her innocence will be
          established. She will be able to return to society to live her life as
          she pleases."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "What? How is that possible? Himiko attacked and nearly killed her
          classmate!" Kazuhito was confused and in disbelief.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What you think doesn't matter. The fact remains that Himiko will be
          able to go home without fear of being arrested." I said before
          bringing out several forms from within my jacket. "But she's not going
          home to you and your family. No, she won't have anything to do with
          you all anymore."
        </p>
        <p>
          Kazuhito looked at the papers I dropped on his lap with confusion. As
          he read the documents, his eyes grew wide.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"Are... you serious?"</p>
        <p>
          "I am." I then reached over to release his right arm. With his writing
          arm free, I held out a pen with a threatening expression.
        </p>
        <p>"Now <i>sign</i>."</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>"My mind... feels fuzzy,"</p>
        <p>
          I rubbed the side of my head. I leaned into my couch, still dressed in
          my jujutsu uniform, as I sat in my dark living room. Zaiko sat on the
          couch beside me, his derpy face looking at me with confusion, while an
          orange folder sat beside me.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was around two in the morning, and all the lights in my house were
          off, leaving my surroundings in darkness. The only light that
          illuminated the room was the moonlight that flooded the room from the
          open shoji door that led outside.
        </p>
        <p>
          My actions from tonight and the past few nights were starting to weigh
          on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          While my actions from the past week weren't as bad as the ones I've
          done during the last two years, which involved me hunting and killing
          the worst of the worst, they stood out more due to the fact I acted
          against innocent people.
        </p>
        <p>Except Himiko's dad. Fuck that guy.</p>
        <p>
          "Did I do the right thing?" I asked myself. "Maybe there were other
          ways? Was what I did right?"
        </p>
        <p><i>Of course not.</i></p>
        <p>
          I thought I would be okay with being the bad guy in order to help
          Himiko. To play into the role of <i>Sukuna </i>in order to free her,
          no matter the cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          But after everything was said and done, I found myself having second
          thoughts on whether or not I did the right thing.
        </p>
        <p>"How annoying. Why is this so complicated?"</p>

        <p>
          A pair of soft footsteps caused me to leave my conflicting thoughts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking behind me, I saw Himiko walk into the living room. Her hair
          was a loose mess, and she was dressed in an oversized shirt. She was
          rubbing one of her eyes as she walked over to me, causing me to
          discreetly slide the orange folder under the couch. Seeing that, Zaiko
          slid off the couch and slithered over it.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sukuna-kun?" Himiko said with a yawn. Her eyes focused on me and
          quickly grew wide in concern. "What's wrong? Did something... happen?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh? No. Why do you ask?" I said and plastered a smile on my face as
          I leaned on the couch. "What are you even doing up?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko said nothing but continued to walk around the couch. Once in
          front of me, she sat down on the couch and shuffled over until her
          body was pressed onto mine. I blinked in confusion as she wrapped her
          arms around my shoulders and then pulled my head onto her chest with a
          small smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "When... I was younger." Himiko spoke as she rubbed my hair. "There
          were days when I was really sad and lonely. I wanted my mother to hold
          me just like this. To make it all go away. But she never did, not
          since...
          <i>that </i>day."
        </p>
        <p>
          I said nothing as she continued to pet my hair, my earlier thoughts
          melting away.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well? Do you feel better?" Himiko asked me softly as she continued to
          hold me.
        </p>
        <p>"...yeah. I think so."</p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "I'm happy to hear that," Himiko said as she leaned her head on my
          own. "I don't want to see the people I love look so sad, so whenever
          you feel down, I'll hold you just like this, okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Love?" I smiled in amusement as I sat up from her hold. Himiko smiled
          and nodded.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes. I love you. You accept and understand me for who I am, and you
          let me suck your blood. You even gave me a home where I can be who I
          want, and you shared your friends with me. People I've come to love as
          well," Himiko blushed brightly and hugged my arm. "You're important to
          me, Sukuna-kun. So I'll always be there for you! No matter what
          happens."
        </p>
        <p>
          I sat in silence as Himiko hummed a little song to herself as she
          continued to cling to my arm.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wasn't sure if the love Himiko felt for me was romantic or if she
          was just using the word as a term of endearment. Her canon self did
          throw that word around pretty loosely, after all. Then again, I
          supposed it didn't matter which one it was.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, Himiko," I said, causing her to look at me in wonder. "You
          just helped me come to terms with what I was struggling with."
        </p>
        <p>"I did? Great!"</p>
        <p><strong>[+20 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I smiled at her as the two of us continued to sit on the couch,
          enjoying each other's presence and company.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 28: NO. 28 - A Glimpse</h2>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Several of Japan's pro heroes were gathering together in a large
          meeting room. Among them were Eraser Head, Crust, Midnight, Edgeshot,
          Best Jeanist, Mirko, and finally, Ingenium. These heroes were seated
          around a long table as two dozen police officers stood in front of the
          room's walls.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Great, now that we're all here, we can begin." Detective Tsukauchi
          Naomasa said as he walked up to the large projector screen in the
          front of the room. "I gathered you all here due to the urgency of the
          matter at hand."
        </p>
        <p>
          Naomasa pointed the small remote in his hand towards the projector
          screen. With a push, the projector came to life and displayed a blurry
          image of a hooded individual jumping from the rooftops of an
          undisclosed city.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eraser Head eyed the elusive figure he had spent the last year trying
          to track. "Sukuna."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That cheating bastard!" Mirko yelled with her arms crossed as she
          glared over at the image. "Just wait until our rematch! I'll kick your
          ass."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Easy there, Mirko." Midnight teased as she leaned back on her chair.
          "It's just a picture."
        </p>
        <p>"I know that, damn it!"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, as some of you are already aware. The individual in this picture
          is the Villian known by many as Sukuna, The King of Curses." Naomasa
          said as he clicked his remote again.
        </p>
        <p>
          The image changed to another image of Sukuna but from a different
          angle. It was zoomed in to show off the bottom half of Sukuna's
          tattooed face, but due to the distance this picture was shot, the
          image was extremely blurry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Naomasa looked away from the image and addressed the assembled heroes.
          "What we initially thought was a lone Vigilante has quickly changed to
          become a dangerous murderer. He is now a suspect in several murders
          and assaults, making him a person of high interest to law enforcement.
          It appears that wherever Sukuna goes, violence and bloodshed follow.
          In just a short year, he has caused multiple deaths and has
          hospitalized those he chooses to spare. My sources indicate that the
          entire underworld of Japan does their best to avoid him."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't understand." Ingenium, otherwise known as Ida Tensei, said.
          "What is his goal? There must be a reason why Sukuna is doing all
          this. Do the police have any leads as to why?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "At the moment, Sukuna's actions are unknown. There doesn't seem to be
          any rhyme or reason for his violent actions." Naomasa said with a
          troubled look. "That makes him unpredictable and extremely dangerous."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed." Crust nodded his head before turning to an annoyed Mirko.
          "However, what bothers me about Sukuna is the fact that Mirko here
          fought and lost to him. I would have thought that such a killer like
          him would have ended her life or even injured her to the point of
          retirement."
        </p>
        <p>
          "He got a lucky shot, that's it!" Mirko shot up to her feet with an
          angry look. "The only reason I lost to that damn bastard was due to
          that cheap trick at the end."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Regardless, Sukuna could defeat a pro hero of Mirko's caliber." Best
          Jeanist said as he brushed his hair to the side. "That makes him
          extremely dangerous. He's no longer some small-time vigilante,
          criminal, or thug. He is a lethal villain. Tell us, Mirko, about your
          fight with him. What quirk does Sukuna have?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Everyone turned to the bunny-themed heroine as she sat back down with
          a thoughtful expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's the thing," Mirko said as she crossed her arms under her
          chest. "I'm not sure. During our fight, he mainly stuck to using that
          super durable staff. From our fight, Sukuna has incredible strength,
          speed, reflexes, and martial arts skills that let him keep up with me.
          But in the end, he made this odd hand motion, and I suddenly felt my
          instincts yell at me to run. And before I could get away,
          <i>something</i> grabbed me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "What do you mean by 'something'?" Edgeshot asked as he looked over at
          Mirko with curiosity.
        </p>

        <p>
          "It's hard to describe," Mirko said, rubbing her hair in frustration.
          "It felt like an invisible force grabbed me and held me in place. My
          instincts were screaming that I was in extreme danger as if I were
          trapped in the jaws of a powerful predator. But before I could even
          attempt to escape, Sukuna charged at me and... knocked me out with one
          punch." Mirko finished her account, feeling a mix of shame and anger.
        </p>
        <p>
          "So we have a highly skilled killer with an unknown quirk that can
          freeze someone in place." Eraser Head said with a sigh. "We're not in
          a good spot."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed." Naomasa nodded as he looked out at everyone in the room.
          "Despite that, we can't continue to let Sukuna do as he pleases. We
          have to bring him to justice."
        </p>
        <p>
          "While I hate to admit this." Midnight said, gaining everyone's
          attention. "Despite his methods, Sukuna's actions have caused the
          crime rate to drop 15% over the last year to today. Now, I'm not
          saying what he's doing is okay. No, he's a killer, and he needs to be
          stopped. But at the same time, his mere presence is becoming a
          deterrent for criminals and villains alike."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That's because the criminal underworld knows that Sukuna won't
          hesitate to kill them. That's not a deterrent. That's fear. And fear
          shouldn't be what stops evil or crime from occurring." Best Jeanist
          said as he leaned forward on the table. "Sukuna must be stopped and
          charged for his heinous crimes. There will be no exceptions."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Still..." Eraser Head said with a sigh. "Sukuna is also a large part
          of why several dozen kidnapped children have been able to go home.
          He's motivations make no sense."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Even so, Jeanist is correct. Sukuna is now one of our top priority
          targets," Naomasa stated as he accepted a stack of folders from one of
          his officers. He began passing the folders around to the gathered
          heroes. "These contain all the information my team and I have gathered
          on him. For now, I recommend that anyone who encounters Sukuna
          immediately call for backup. He is not an opponent to be faced alone.
          I believe our best chance for victory is through a coordinated attack
          involving many pro heroes working together."
        </p>
        <p>
          Midnight leaned over to the rabbit-themed hero. "He's talking about
          you, Mirko."
        </p>
        <p>"Shut up!"</p>
        <p>
          "Enough." Eraser Head muttered as he received one of the folders. "We
          have a lot to cover. So let's get to work."
        </p>

        <p><strong>[Shimizu Souta POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          In the tranquility of the early morning, I sat cross-legged on a worn
          mat in the center of my home's dojo. The air was still, carrying only
          the faint scent of sandalwood from the far-off burning incense. My
          eyes were gently closed, shielding me from the vibrant world beyond. I
          took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill my lungs, then slowly
          exhaled, releasing any tension that clung to me.
        </p>
        <p><i>Find it... find it. Find the core of cursed energy.</i></p>
        <p>
          With each breath, I focused on the rhythm of my chest rising and
          falling, allowing thoughts to drift like leaves on a gentle stream. I
          acknowledged them without judgment, letting them come and go, inviting
          a sense of calm to envelop me. My mind slowly began to settle like
          dust after a storm.
        </p>
        <p><i>Turn negative energy into positive energy.</i></p>
        <p>
          As I sank deeper into the stillness, a wave of serenity washed over
          me, grounding me in the present moment. At the same time, waves of
          cursed energy danced around my body like roaring flames.
        </p>
        <p>
          Time seemed to stretch, with each minute transforming into an eternity
          of peace. The sounds of the world outside faded away, replaced by the
          gentle rhythm of my heartbeat.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was then that I finally saw <i>it</i>. It was a flicker, barely a
          second. But I finally saw <strong><i>it</i></strong

        <p>The core. The core of cursed energy!</p>

          But as fast as it came, it quickly disappeared just as I was about to
          reach out and grab it!

          "Shit!" I fell back to my back and looked up at the star-filled night
          sky. "I was so close! It was right there! Damn it all!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, despite my failure to grab the core of curse energy, I was
          still extremely happy to finally have gotten a glimpse of it after
          several months of meditation to reach it.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was only a matter of time before I learned the reversed curse
          technique!
        </p>
        <p>
          Sure, I could use Round Deer to heal myself, but I didn't want to rely
          on my Shikigami all the time. I needed to be able to heal my body on
          my own.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah," I muttered as it finally hit me that I had meditated all day.
          "Not again."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Sukuna-kun! You're finally done! I was getting worried for a second
          there."
        </p>
        <p>
          I looked over to see Himiko dressed in her pajamas as she walked out
          of our house, a small smile on her face. In her hands was a bucket
          full of ice and water.
        </p>
        <p>"...Himiko."</p>
        <p>"Yes?"</p>
        <p>"What's that bucket for?"</p>
        <p>
          "Oh, I was worried you turned to stone, so I was going to dump this on
          you to check."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"...thanks?"</p>
        <p>
          Himiko nodded and spun back to go back inside. "You're welcome! I put
          your dinner in the fridge, by the way. I'm going to bed now,
          goodnight!"
        </p>
        <p>"Uh, yeah. Goodnight."</p>
        <p>
          I nodded numbly at her as she closed the sliding door before standing
          up. I moved around and stretched my stuff joints with a nervous
          expression.
        </p>

        <p>
          She had been in a lot better spirits after she had called Keiko,
          Izuku, and even Mei back to let them all know she was okay after
          running off that day. They had all accepted her apology rather
          quickly, causing Himiko to glow with glee, knowing that her new
          friends didn't hate her. She and Keiko were even in the talks of
          setting up some sort of get-together or sleepover with just the three
          girls.
        </p>
        <p>The fools, good luck getting Mei to agree to come along.</p>
        <p>
          "I need an alarm clock..." As I was finishing my stretches, I grinned
          and decided to check on my luck today. With a snap of my fingers, the
          gacha machine that's been the bane of my new gambling addiction popped
          into existence.

        <p>
          "It's not gambling night, but let's see what you got for me tonight,
          Gacha gods. I'm feeling lucky," I said as I used enough points to get
          a Platinum tier reward pull. Grabbing the glowing prize ball, I tossed
          it in the air with an amused smile before snapping it open. "Heh,
          maybe I'll get a special-grade cursed weapon? I wouldn't say no to the
          Split Soul Katana. It'll go well with Playful Cloud-"

          I felt my breath leave me suddenly as I fell to my knees. The
          knowledge of how to use the Limitless filled my brain in an instant.
        </p>
        <p>This was it.</p>

        <p>
          Before I could jump for joy and thank the benevolent gacha gods, my
          brain jerked to a stop when it sensed a missing qualification in order
          for me to use the Limitless technique.

        <p>
          The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as Himiko and I
          settled into a corner booth at the cozy café. Sunlight streamed
          through the large windows, casting a warm glow over the polished
          wooden tables. The gentle hum of conversation and the clinking of
          cutlery added to the inviting atmosphere.
        </p>
        <p>
          After receiving our orders, I sipped on my black coffee while Himiko
          indulged in a rich mocha, its chocolatey sweetness bringing a smile to
          her face. Only for it to quickly melt into a nervous expression.
        </p>
        <p>"Relax, Himiko. Trust me, it's all going to be fine."</p>
        <p>
          "I do trust you. It's just... I can't help but be a little nervous,"
          Himiko confessed, her eyes darting around the café, a hint of fear in
          them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't be," I said as I grabbed her hand. "Everything is going to be
          fine. I made sure of it."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+20 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Himiko nodded and took another sip of her drink. Despite my attempt to
          calm her down, she still looked a little nervous. The two of us
          continued to wait for our guest in the cafe. With each bell ring of
          the cafe's door, Himiko seemed to grow even more nervous.
        </p>
        <p>
          "He's here," I said without looking up while I sipped my second
          coffee. Himiko let out a cute squeak as the cafe's bell chimed once
          again.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering the cafe was no other than Detective Ige Yoichi. His aged
          eyes scanned the cafe before falling on me and Himiko. He froze
          momentarily when our eyes met. A slow grin rose on my face as I
          watched him swallow the lump in his throat.
        </p>
        <p>
          After taking a deep breath, Yoichi walked over to us and placed his
          briefcase on our table. As he sat down, Himiko slid over until her
          body was pressed against mine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Detective Ige," I said with an easygoing tone. My face was etched
          into one of superiority, resembling a certain king of heroes. "I was
          beginning to think you wouldn't show."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "...sorry. Getting everything in place took some time." Yoichi said as
          he opened his briefcase. He then looked over to Himiko. "It's nice to
          finally meet you, Toga-san. I'm Detective Ige Yoichi. I'm glad to see
          you're alright."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, yes," Himiko said without looking at the Detective, her eyes
          scanning the windows and doors for any uninvited guests. "Are you...
          the one who has been handling my case?"
        </p>
        <p>"Indeed I am... Or at least, I was."</p>
        <p>
          "Huh?" Himiko said in confusion as Yoichi slid over several sheets of
          paper to her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clicking on a pen, he held it out to Himiko. "Write down
          <i>your </i>version of events from that day. Once I receive that, I'll
          take care of the remaining bits of the investigation to close it. It
          should be but another few days before I can clear you."
        </p>

        <p>"...huh?" Himiko said numbly. "Clear me? What... do you mean?"</p>
        <p>
          Raising an eyebrow, Yoichi turned to me questioningly. I smiled
          innocently and took another sip of my drink. Sighing, Yoichi looked
          back to Himiko.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shuji Saito and Emiko Sayaka have revealed the truth about what
          actually happened at Corellia Junior High three months ago. Shuji
          Saito confessed to me that he attacked you because you rejected him.
          In anger, he tried to attack you. In order to defend yourself from a
          much larger and stronger attacker, you found a nearby box cutter and
          struck him. Emiko Sayaka has also admitted that she was under the
          influence of hallucinating drugs the day she witnessed the incident
          involving you and Saito. What she thought was you drinking his blood
          through a straw was actually a misinterpretation. Once her mind was
          cleared of the drugs, Sayaka was able to recall that, in actuality,
          you were attempting to give Saito first aid."
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko blinked numbly and nodded. She then turned to me with a
          questioning glance, only to receive a smile from me.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+40 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "...yes. That's right." Himiko said with a frown, leaning into the
          story. "That's... what happened."
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoichi closed his eyes and sighed, almost as if in disappointment. "I
          see. I need you to retell those <i>exact </i>events in writing. Once I
          submit those, you will be cleared of any crimes and wrongdoing. You
          will be free to rejoin society with a clean record."
        </p>
        <p>
          Nodding, Himiko quickly began to do what she was told, but she
          stopped.
        </p>
        <p>
          "What's... what's going to happen to Saito-kun and Sayaka-chan?"
          Himiko whispered, a tinge of regret in her voice. I glanced at her and
          watched as she waited for Yoichi's response.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Saito is currently in a Juvenile Detention Center where he will serve
          his time for his... crime. Sayaka's case is still being determined. My
          guess is that she will also face some time in a Detention Center. But
          that's still to be determined by a judge." Yoichi said as he then
          reached into his briefcase to pull out another stack of papers. "This
          is also for you, Toga-san."
        </p>
        <p>
          Accepting the papers, Himiko read them over with steadily widening
          eyes. For the first time today, a large, bright smile broke out on her
          face, a clear sign of her relief and joy. "Is this... for real?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Indeed," Yoichi muttered and eyed me with a careful gaze, his caution
          evident. "Your parents have signed a private agreement stating they
          will have no more to do with you and that any family ties you have
          with them are no more. As of today, you are free to live your life as
          you please."
        </p>
        <p>"Does that mean... that I'm free?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yes, Himiko," I said, causing the happy girl to turn to me. Tears
          pooled in her eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"You're <i>free </i>now."</p>

        <p>
          The sun hung high in the sky, casting a warm golden light over the
          park as Himiko and I strolled along the winding path. The air was
          fresh, scented with blooming flowers and the distant aroma of a nearby
          food cart, where laughter mingled with the sound of sizzling.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Look at those ducks," Himiko pointed, giggling softly as a cluster of
          mallards splashed in a small pond, quacking loudly as they fought over
          breadcrumbs tossed by an enthusiastic child. Her face was free of any
          medical mask or hood to hide her identity.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glanced over, a smile creeping onto my face. "They seem to have
          their priorities straight," I replied, raising an eyebrow playfully.
          "A perfect picture of chaos."
        </p>
        <p>
          As we walked, the leaves danced gently in the breeze, creating a soft
          rustle that blended harmoniously with the distant sounds of children
          playing. The park was alive—couples were sprawled out on blankets,
          families were playing catch, and joggers zipped past, their feet
          thudding rhythmically against the path.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know," Himiko said thoughtfully, her cat-like eyes cloudy as she
          took in our surroundings. "The world around us feels so... magical
          right now. It feels like the world is slowing down just for me."
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded, my gaze lingering on her as she sauntered with her hands
          behind her. "Is that so? Makes you appreciate the little things,
          doesn't it?"
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah... exactly."</p>
        <p>
          We continued walking side by side, her fingers brushing mine
          occasionally. Himiko took a deep breath, feeling the warmth of the sun
          on her skin. "I'm so happy I met you," she abruptly said, glancing up
          at me. "It's thanks to you that my life's changed so much... I can
          finally be <i>me</i>."
        </p>
        <p>
          I shook my head and watched as an older couple walked past us, hand in
          hand. "You don't have to thank me. I just did what I had to do to help
          my friend. Now, you can go back to school or do whatever you want. The
          sky's the limit."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Himiko's perpetual blush grew brighter, and she nodded as we
          approached a small gazebo surrounded by vibrant flower beds. As we
          stepped inside, her eyes lit up. "Let's sit for a while," she
          suggested, gesturing to the weathered wooden benches.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sinking onto the bench, we shared a comfortable silence, watching the
          world around us. Children's laughter echoed in the distance, and for a
          moment, everything felt just right.
        </p>
        <p>I turned to her, my expression softening.</p>
        <p>
          Despite my brain telling me to shut up and enjoy the silence, a part
          of me wanted to open up. "You know, I really enjoy these silent
          moments with you, Himiko. It's nice... Growing up, I used to be all
          alone after Keiko left. So having someone else to share the silence
          makes it a little easier."
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko smiled, her heart fluttering at his words. "Me too, Sukuna-kun.
          It's nice to just be here. Together."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+50 SP]</strong></p>

        <p>
          The two of us sat in silence as we watched the world around us without
          much care for anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, all the terrible things I did to get to this point felt
          extremely worth it. Seeing Himiko's relaxed smile, I knew I would do
          it again.
        </p>
        <p>"Hey, Sukuna-kun?"</p>
        <p>"Yeah?"</p>
        <p>
          "Can... can I continue to live with you?" Himiko whispered, a tinge of
          nervousness in her voice, as she slid closer to me until our shoulders
          were pressed together.
        </p>
        <p>"Of course. You can stay as long as you want."</p>
        <p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"Okay... then I'll stay with you forever then."</p>
        <p>
          At her response, I found myself chuckling. She seemed offended by my
          laugh, but she quickly joined me.

          For the first time since my parents died, I felt a part of my heart

          It stands as a testament to ancient Japanese spirituality and

          "Excellent," I said and raised a walkie-talkie. "Team B. How's it
          going on your end? Over."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Team B reporting in. All the wolf statues have been prayed to, and we
          left plenty of offerings behind. Phase 2 is complete. Over." Clone C
          said from the other end.
        </p>
        <p>
          I nodded and looked over to the majestic shrine. This location would
          typically be ripe with locals and foreign visitors, but it was empty
          due to the dark sky above me. It was around three in the morning,
          meaning there wasn't anyone around to disturb my ritual.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Where's Hikari?!" I called out as I scanned my surroundings. After a
          few seconds of looking around, I finally found the crow. He was
          cuddling up next to Crow Kirara. "Get over here!"
        </p>
        <p>
          (Tch! Yeah, yeah.) Crow Hikari muttered and flew to stand on my
          shoulder. (Why do you need me anyway?)
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, if you're anything like your counterpart. You'll be bursting
          with good luck for me to sponge off." I said while holding up some
          corn for him to eat, which he did. "After all, tonight we gamble away
          my hard-earned saved-up points!"
        </p>
        <p>
          (Hah! I see! Let's gamble it all away then!) Crow Hikari said as he
          began to dance a little crow dance while rave music started to play in
          the background. Looking back, I saw two of my clones dancing while a
          large portable speaker sat on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Alright, knock it off!" I yelled, causing one of the clones to turn
          off the music.
        </p>
        <p>"...buzz kill."</p>
        <p>"Who invited him?"</p>
        <p>"Gueh," Zaiko muttered from his spot on a lawn chair.</p>
        <p>
          I ignored their comments and brought out the prayer beads from my
          black and white kimono. With a snap of my fingers, the Gacha machine
          materialized to life. I then dismissed my clones and took a deep
          breath.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[Total SP: 9,949]</strong></p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          "I was somehow lucky to have pulled the Limitless a week ago; now all
          I need to do is get the Six Eyes. Hopefully, all my preparations will
          come in clutch." I muttered and mulled over what to do. "Let's see...
          while I could go all in and do two Platinum pulls, I could waste
          almost all my points if they fail like those other six other tries I
          did over the year. No, I need to play this smart. Start small and do
          one Platinum pull at the end."
        </p>
        <p>
          With my mind made up, I reached over to the machine and used enough
          points for two Silver-tier pulls. Most of the rewards were more junk
          or clothes, leaving only two worthwhile rewards.
        </p>

        <p>"Not bad, not bad. Okay, next!"</p>
        <p>
          Moving up, I used enough points to do two Gold tier pulls. Sadly, the
          majority of the pulls were some repeat skills, items, or techniques I
          already had. Fortunately, my last pull ended up being a decent reward.

        </p>
        <p>
          "Another Shikigami," I said as Crow Hikari and I watched a swirl of CE
          appear in the air before us.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quickly, the CE formed itself into a large, glowing jellyfish-like
          creature with several tendrils flowing about. Its large black eyes
          looked around before settling on me with an unfocused look.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hey there," I said without much care. My hands pressed together to
          unleash a Piercing Blood attack. "I'm just going to ask you this
          once... are you loyal to me?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Fortunately for the jellyfish, it nodded and flew to stand behind me.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Good. You will be known as... Jello, from now on!" I said, causing
          Jello to tilt its head in confusion before nodding.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then commanded Jello to go chill next to Zaiko. Jello followed my
          order and glided over to my wormy companion. The two of them turned to
          one another before nodding in acknowledgment.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm, maybe all of the Shikigami I pull will be naturally loyal to me?
          Then again, Rika is a different case. She's incredibly loyal to Yuta,
          so who knows if she'll be like Zaiko or Jello." I said, turning back
          to the gacha machine. "Ah, well. I'll leave future me to deal with
          that. Now then, let's keep going."
        </p>
        <p>
          I twisted the machine's dial after using 1500 SP for a Diamond tier
          pull. As I waited for my reward, I grew more anxious now that I was at
          the more expensive tiers. I rubbed my prayer beads between my palms
          and prayed to any god who would listen.
        </p>
        <p>"C'mon Gege! Give me something good!"</p>

          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "I mean... this is fine. It's fine. One more time!" I turned the dial
          after spending another 1500 SP. I waited anxiously, my hands blurring
          as they rubbed the prayer beads, causing smoke to bellow out from the
          friction. "C'mon, C'mon, C'mon! Hikari! Dance! Boost my luck!"
        </p>
        <p>
          (You got it!) Crow Hikari cawed and began to dance back and forth
          while Crow Kirara turned the music back on.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >[You have pulled: Zenin Naobito's Cursed Technique, Projection
            Sorcery! Rank: Diamond.]</strong
          >
        </p>

        <p>
          "Yes! Great pull!" I pumped my fist and felt the knowledge of the
          technique fill my brain. Crow Kirara turned off the music and waited
          for her cue. "I was going to blow my brains out if I got another
          repeat technique."
        </p>
        <p>
          (Can you do that while I'm not around?) Crow Hikari said as he flapped
          his wings.
        </p>
        <p>
          I ignored my crow and turned to my remaining points. I had 3,549 SP
          left. It's just barely enough for a Platinum pull. I took a deep
          breath to calm my jittery nerves and reached for the gacha machine.
        </p>
        <p>"...use 3500 SP."</p>
        <p>
          Twisting the dial, my crows and I waited with bated breath as the
          machine vibrated and glowed. Due to the success with my last Platinum
          pull that resulted in me gaining the Limitless, I was worried all my
          good luck for the month was gone.
        </p>
        <p><i>Clink.</i></p>
        <p>(Yo, Boss... you got something.)</p>
        <p>"I did? Huh, I thought my mind was just coping."</p>
        <p>
          I reached out to the glowing prize ball and tenderly held it in my
          palm. I swallowed the lump in my throat as my mind whirled at what
          could be within the small plastic ball. "Come on, give me something
          good."

            >[You have pulled: Ryomen Sukuna's Domain Expansion, Malevolent
            Shrine! Rank: Platinum.]</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "Holy... shit!" I yelled, my eyes wide as saucers. "Finally! A Domain
          Expansion! And not just any Domain Expansion! <i>The </i>Domain
          Expansion!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though I was thrilled to have won one of JJK's best Domains, I
          felt my mind hit a roadblock.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I see... This is like the Limitless." I said with a thoughtful
          expression. "To use Malevolent Shrine, I must already have Sukuna's
          Shrine technique. Without that, I can't use the domain. It's safe to
          assume that any other Domain Expansion I pull will need its original
          technique in order for it to work. Tch! I should have gotten Chimera
          Shadow Garden or Coffin of the Iron Mountain, then.
        </p>
        <p>
          I flopped onto the ground and looked at the night sky with a
          disappointed but happy smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Regardless, I got some great rewards today," I said, placing my hands
          behind my head. "Hmm, I wonder how the girls are doing?"
        </p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Three girls, Keiko, Mei, and Himiko, sat on the carpeted floor,
          surrounded by colorful blankets and pillows in Keiko's bedroom. The
          soft sounds of conversation and the playing movie on the blue-haired
          girl's laptop filled the air.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiko, dressed in her pajamas, excitedly pulled out a deck of cards
          out of her closet. Himiko, wearing an oversized shirt she had borrowed
          from Souta's closet, continued to style Mei's hair. Meanwhile, Mei,
          who was dressed in a loose shirt and shorts, nestled deep into the
          pile of cushions she had created for herself while Himiko worked on
          her hair.
        </p>

        <p>
          In Mei's hands was the latest issue of Inventors Weekly. It was all
          she was able to grab before her mother all but snatched her from her
          room before driving her to Keiko's house for a "normal girl"
          sleepover.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How about a game of Uno, girls?" Keiko asked as she crawled over to
          Mei's pile of cushions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "That depends. How much are we playing for?" Mei asked as she flipped
          a page in her magazine.
        </p>
        <p>
          "...you and Sou-chan play for money a lot, don't you?" she quipped,
          her tone light and playful.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yup." Mei smiled as she looked up from her magazine. "But he usually
          ropes my Papa in, too."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm, that sounds like him." Keiko sighed, turning to look over at
          Himiko, who was humming. She continued to work on Mei's hair. "Hey,
          Himiko-chan. I know how Mei-chan met Sou-chan, but I never asked how
          you two met."
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko glanced up from Mei's hair, a small, warm smile on her face. "I
          ran into him one night while I was out for a walk. I hadn't eaten all
          day, and he offered me a meat bun." As she talked, Mei's mouth fell
          into a small frown. Confusing her before she shrugged the feeling
          away. "We started talking and discovered that we had a lot in common."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm." Keiko smiled knowingly as she looked at both Himiko and Mei. "I
          see. What a wonderful story. It seems like Sou-chan grew to be a lot
          more generous with age. Back at the orphanage, he wouldn't even think
          about sharing his stuff with anyone. Well, other than me, at least."
        </p>
        <p>
          "That reminds me..." Mei said as Himiko stepped away, her work done.
          Her hair was now styled into twin tails. "You and Souta grew up
          together, right? How... how was he like?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiko blinked as both Himiko and Mei looked at her with curious
          expressions. Keiko took a moment to collect her thoughts, her gaze
          drifting off to a corner of the room, where a small framed picture of
          her and Souta back from when they lived in the orphanage hung on the
          wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, Sou-chan was always a bit of a mystery to me when we were
          younger. All he did was read or draw," Keiko started with a nostalgic
          smile on her face. "He was the kind of person who would ignore
          everyone around him, no matter who it was. Even though he didn't seem
          to care much about anyone, he always kept an eye out for me for some
          reason." Keiko said as she brushed her left shoulder unconsciously,
          catching Himiko's eye.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I guess it was because I was quite a handful—more than any other kid.
          There was one summer when I tried to build a treehouse for everyone. I
          nearly got some kids and myself stuck in that tree behind the
          orphanage for hours! But then he showed up and helped us all down."
          Himiko and Mei smiled softly as they listened to Keiko. "From that
          point on, he always nagged me to be careful in whatever I did.
          Sou-chan would even share his snacks with me sometimes and tell me
          some of his made-up stories. He also helped me with my homework when I
          couldn't figure it out."
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiko paused, a hint of laughter in her eyes. "But he could also be a
          little odd and overprotective, too. Once, a kid from our elementary
          school tried to bully me because I... didn't have any parents... but
          then Sou-chan showed up and began beating up the boy. He did end up
          getting in trouble, but he didn't care. It was hilarious and kinda
          scary at the same time."
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking back at Himiko and Mei, Keiko's happy expression melted into
          one of sadness. "But a few years back, I was lucky enough to finally
          be adopted. I was so happy when they told me I would go home with a
          new family. Only to quickly cry when I realized I'd be leaving
          Sou-chan behind." Keiko said as she quickly rubbed her eyes. "H-he
          said, "Don't worry about me, damn it. Go on and be happy. I'll be just
          fine."... He always had that bad habit of saying bad words. After I
          left, we'd talk on the phone every now and then, but it wasn't the
          same. I... I missed my <i>big brother</i> a lot."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Keiko-chan..." Himiko whispered and crawled over to the now softly
          crying girl to give her a hug. Mei looked uncomfortable, but she
          quickly ended up copying Himiko, not too sure what else to do. The
          three hugged one another as a warm, comfortable silence hung in the
          room.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just so you know," Keiko whispered from between her two new but still
          precious friends. "If either of you do something to him... you'll
          regret it."
