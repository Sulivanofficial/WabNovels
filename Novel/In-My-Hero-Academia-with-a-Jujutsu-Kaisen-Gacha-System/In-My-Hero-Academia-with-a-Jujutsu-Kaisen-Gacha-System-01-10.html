        <h2>Chapter 1: NO. 1 - Shimizu Souta: Origin</h2>
<p>What is reincarnation?</p>
<p>
  From what I understood, reincarnation is the religious or philosophical belief
  that the soul or spirit, after biological death, begins a new life in a new
  body that may be human or animal.
</p>
<p>Now, then, what is transmigration?</p>
<p>
  Transmigration, also known as rebirth, is the idea that a living being's
  non-physical essence starts a new life in a different body after death.
</p>
<p>
  Some would say these two concepts are the exact same or similar enough that
  they might as well have the same word to describe them. Others would argue
  that these two concepts are completely different and come with their own
  distinct differences.
</p>
<p>What is my opinion on the matter, one may ask?</p>
<p>It's simple.</p>
<p>"Who fucking cares?"</p>
<p>"Sou-chan! You can't say that! That's a bad word!"</p>
<p>"Meh."</p>
<p>
  I looked away from the young, pale-blue-haired little girl and popped another
  grape into my mouth. I ignored her annoyed pout and looked up at the annoying
  blue sky as I continued eating my snack. Sighing in defeat, my fellow orphan
  retook her seat next to me on one of the small pastel-colored chairs and
  grabbed her half-eaten cookie.
</p>
<p>"...want a grape?"</p>
<p>"Really?!"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Here."</p>
<p>
  Hase Keiko's vibrant yellow eyes glowed with happiness as she accepted my
  offer. She didn't wait to devour the sweet and crunchy pieces of fruit as she
  chewed on the fruit with a large smile.
</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sou-chan!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah. You're welcome."</p>
<p>
  Now then, where was I? Ah, yes. I was talking about reincarnation and or
  transmigration. It's definitely not something a five-year-old child like
  myself would normally think about or deliberate during their recess break.
  However, the topic was very relevant to my current situation.
</p>
<p>
  I was a person who was seemingly reborn with all their past memories into a
  new world. It was a crazy and almost unbelievable fact the moment I realized
  the truth after I realized I was once again a baby being held in my mother's
  arms. I had tried to brush this off as a dream, but the dream had seemingly
  never ended. Seeing that this was now my reality, I had to take the reality of
  my situation seriously and move on.
</p>
<p>"Ah! Sou-chan! Kei-chan! Let's go play hero!"</p>
<p>
  I looked over at another fellow orphan as he came to a stop in front of both
  Keiko and me with an excited smile. The boy had dark orange hair and
  orange-colored eyes. However, the color of his hair and eyes was quickly
  forgotten when the young boy's body resembled an anthropomorphic red-scaled
  walking lizard. This fact would normally cause everyone in the area to panic
  and run in fear or confusion. At least, it would have in my past life.
</p>
<p>"Okay!" Keiko nodded and jumped off her chair. "Let's go, Sou-chan!"</p>
<p>"I'll pass," I said and waved them away. "You two go ahead."</p>
<p>
  Keiko looked dissatisfied with my answer, but the walking lizard, Tsuchida
  Hideo, nodded and grabbed her wrist. He began to pull the surprised Keiko off
  towards the center of the orphanage's open courtyard, where several other
  children were grouped up together. Off to the sides were a few of the
  orphanage's caretakers watching the gathered kids with amused smiles as they
  continued their daily chores or duties.
</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! I want to be All Might!"</p>
<p>"No! You were All Might yesterday! It's my turn!"</p>
<p>
  "No way! See! I have yellow hair like All Might, so I should be All Might!"
</p>
<p>"No fair! No fair!"</p>
<p>
  I sighed as the group of kids began to argue about who would be Japan's number
  one hero in today's session of their made-up game, heroes and Villains.
</p>
<p>
  Yes, you heard me right. All Might. The plus ultra guy that can punch a hole
  through the atmosphere and change the weather. A fictional character from one
  of <i>my</i>
</p>

world's hit anime/manga series, My Hero Academia, was now, in fact, a real
person in this world.
<p></p>
<p>
  This means that alongside him, every other character from that series was now
  a living, tangible person alongside the very world the author of the series
  created. At least if everything I've seen on television was to be believed,
  this meant I was now in a world where around 80% of the population had some
  sort of power or quirk that could determine the course of your life.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >Why couldn't I have just vanished into the nothingness of the universe?
    Instead, I'm now stuck in this train wreck of a world. </i
  >I released a long sigh and leaned my head back onto my chair. "I guess it's
  not so bad. I could have popped up in Attack on Titan or Berserk." But still,
  the thought of being in a world where 80% of the population has a quirk is
  daunting. It's not the world I was used to, and it's a lot to take in.
</p>
<p>
  I closed my eyes and popped another grape in my mouth. I leaned back and
  relaxed under the sun's warm rays of light.
</p>
<p>
  In my previous life, I had greatly enjoyed the series for what it was. But as
  the story progressed and began to near its inevitable end, the writing and
  character direction completely lost me. I had dropped MHA after class 1-A used
  the power of friendship to bring back the series protagonist,
  Bakugo-<i>cough</i>, I mean Midoriya Izuku, back from his short stint as a
  vigilante.
</p>
<p>
  This meant I had a pretty good understanding of the future and people in this
  world. Well, that is if everything happens like it did in canon. If not, then
  I got nothing, and I'd continue with my plan of getting the heck out of Japan
  as soon as I possibly could. I had no interest in sticking around for the fall
  of Japan's society when shit hit the fan after all. But even with my
  knowledge, I have to be careful. I can't predict every twist and turn, and I
  don't want to get caught up in something I can't handle.
</p>
<p>
  Some would say, "Why don't you use your knowledge of the plot to help you?
  Wouldn't you have an incredible advantage you could leverage to propel you to
  the top?" Normally, they would have a point. My future knowledge made me
  incredibly powerful. I could turn the tides of either side easily if I wished
  or use my knowledge to place myself at the top of the hero world.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there was a caveat.</p>
<p>
  I was five, almost six, years old, and I had not awakened a damn quirk due to
  an extra joint in my fucking toe. I was quirkless and had no real potential in
  this world's society.
</p>
<p>
  Normally, In cases like mine where an individual gets placed into a fictional
  world, it's usually due to a being of higher power or a god wanting to fuck
  with me for some sick amusement. Usually, at least in the stories I've read or
  seen where this was the case, the person who was reborn would have received an
  OP ability or a cheat to help them progress in this world.
</p>
<p>I, however, didn't get Jack shit and was born as a normal person.</p>
<p>Trust me, I tested it.</p>
<p>
  I had tried lifting objects much heavier than myself to discover if I had
  superhuman strength. Nothing. I had tried running faster than Speed of Sound,
  Sonic. Also nothing. I had tried expelling beams of power out of my eyes,
  hands, and feet. Surprise! Even more, nothing! The only thing that
  differentiated this body from my past one was my ability to learn stuff. I
  guess you could call me smart but in a world where might makes right, that
  shit didn't matter.
</p>
<p>
  To make matters worse, my parents from this life had died due to a massive
  fight that nearly leveled an entire city block into a flaming parking lot.
  Remember that clip sad-sack Deku loved to watch when he was but a wee lad? The
  one where All Might pulled out several people from a flaming wasteland with a
  smile? That's the one. My parents had died due to one of our apartment walls
  crashing down and crushing them alive.
</p>
<p>
  I had watched them be crushed before my very eyes as a small three-year-old.
  Completely helpless and weak to do anything as their pained screams filled my
  ears as the stone column slowly crushed them to death-
</p>
<p>
  "Fuck! Okay! Stop that, stop it." I closed my eyes and grasped the sides of my
  face tightly as my stomach felt like it was about to launch all my grapes back
  out.
</p>
<p>
  It didn't matter that I was a person reborn into a fictional world; seeing
  that was seriously messed up, and the nightmares from that day still haunted
  me every now and then. I had to be some sort of psychopath if what I saw it
  didn't affect me at all. I didn't even like thinking about it.
</p>
<p>Moving on, then.</p>
<p>
  I released my face and frowned as I watched the kids running around as they
  chased one another. Their game of heroes and villains resembled something more
  like tag but with teams. I joined in from time to time so I didn't give off
  the impression that I wasn't a normal kid to the adults. It was a pretty
  simple game, but it was a nice distraction from the monotony of being a child
  with little freedom.
</p>
<p>
  As the kids ran around, I looked around the orphanage with uninterested eyes.
</p>
<p>
  The orphanage was a large, old building with a worn but welcoming appearance.
  The exterior was painted in a soft, pastel color, giving it a sense of warmth
  and comfort. As one entered the building, you were greeted by a spacious and
  bright common area where children's laughter echoed off the walls. Colorful
  drawings and artwork adorned the walls, adding a touch of cheerfulness to the
  surroundings.
</p>
<p>
  Around the open courtyard, small, pastel-colored chairs and tables were
  scattered around the area, creating a cozy and inviting atmosphere for us
  children. The caretakers moved about with gentle smiles, tending to the needs
  of the children and ensuring that we felt safe and loved, at least to a point.
</p>
<p>
  This orphanage was primarily used to house all the children and young adults
  who lost their parents or guardians during that tragic night. Some of the
  children sported burn scars and different healed injuries on their bodies as
  they ran around with reckless abandon while they laughed. Despite how it
  seems, I knew a lot of my fellow orphans were deeply affected by losing their
  parents and or siblings from the destruction. Looking down at my scarred
  hands, I grimaced at the memory of my pitiful attempts at removing the flaming
  debris that separated me from my parents.
</p>
<p>
  "Okay, kids!" I looked up to see one of our caretakers, a woman with kind
  features and brown hair, call out to us with a small smile. "It's time to head
  back inside!"
</p>
<p>
  A collective wave of disappointed groans and moans sounded out from the
  children as they all slowly marched into the main building. I hopped to my
  feet and joined the orderly line of children as we walked inside towards our
  rooms to clean up for supper.
</p>
<p>x x x</p>
<p>Shimizu Souta.</p>
<p>
  That was the name I was given this time around. It was also the name that sat
  next to three others on the door that led to my shared room. I walked up to my
  bed and threw my body on its soft surface with a grunt. Tilting my head, I
  looked over to my nightstand and reached over to open the top drawer. Reaching
  in, I pulled out a small notebook and flipped through the several pages of
  writing I did.
</p>
<p>
  As with everything in life, given enough time, I was sure I would forget
  several key points of the MHA plot. So, to avoid that, I had written
  everything down in this notebook so I wouldn't forget. This normally would
  have been risky. What if the notebook fell into the wrong hands? If that were
  to happen, I would be seriously fucked. So, to avoid that, I wrote everything
  as if I were writing a fictional fantasy story and switched up key names with
  placeholders.
</p>
<p>
  One example would be that Midoriya Izuku's name was changed to Sheep Boi,
  while Bakugo Katsuki is now Spiky PomPom.
</p>
<p>Great names, I know.</p>

<p>Anyways...</p>
<p>
  I had tried to figure out where I was in the timeline by looking through the
  news and any information UA released about its students. I also watched the
  yearly UA sports festivals to see if any of the Big Three showed up to give me
  a better idea as well. From what I knew, Mirio, Nejire, and Tamaki, UA's Big
  Three, were third years in the original canon, so that would clue me in on
  when things would start with Midoriya.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, those three haven't showed up yet. Meaning they were probably
  still kids and I had to wait a couple more years until things popped off. Once
  I finally see them at the sports festival, I would finally get my indication
  of when to start getting my shit together to leave the country. No way in hell
  would I be here when All for One started wrecking everything.
</p>
<p>
  Despite my plan of getting the hell outta dodge, I still wrote down everything
  I could remember from the original story. This starts when Midoriya first
  meets All Might during the Sludge villain incident, and it goes up to the
  point where Shigiraki skewers Bakugo and nearly kills Gran Tarino. The last
  thing I remember reading was Midoriya going through his lone wolf arc until
  when his goodie-to-shoes classmates bring him back to school with the power of
  friendship.
</p>
<p>
  Ugh. After that, I don't have a clue what happens, so whenever things get to
  that point, I'll be left completely blind to whatever awaits the world.
</p>
<p>
  Damn it. Why didn't I stick with the series until it ended? Assuming the
  series did have an ending and that it didn't continue going for several more
  years until Midoriya and his classmates graduated. Well, this is all on the
  assumption that my actions don't derail the main plot from its course.
</p>
<p>Such is the Butterfly effect.</p>
<p>
  Then again, I had no intention of getting involved in Horikoshi's mess. So I
  didn't really have to worry about the future-

</p>
<p>
  "Now, wait a minute! I have way too many questions!" I swiped at the floating
  screen as all the informational screens vanished, leaving behind a small
  floating Gachapon machine in front of me. The machine looked exactly like any
  other gachapon machine that could be found in Japan. The prizes inside all
  contained different colored prize balls that glowed with a mysterious power.
  At the center was a large dial that one would use to pull a prize. "This can't
  be real. I'm going nuts! I knew I should have gone to that therapist like that
  doctor said!"
</p>
<p>
  Despite saying that, I eyed the lever with curious but suspicious eyes. Taking
  a deep breath, I reached over and turned the dial. I jumped back in surprise
  as the dial's surprisingly cool metallic texture. I took a few seconds to calm
  my beating heart and once again grabbed the lever.
</p>

<p><strong>[How much SP would you like to use?]</strong></p>
<p>
  "I see. So I have to tell the machine how many points I want to use. Let's
  see, I have enough points to do any of the five options. But doing the most
  expensive options will limit how many pulls I can do." I debated on what to do
  and brushed back my black hair with a groan. "I can't believe I'm really
  entertaining this delusion. Still, if there's even a small chance that I'm not
  crazy and this thing is legit, then this could be my opportunity to rise to
  the top."
</p>
<p>
  Jujutsu Kaisen is another anime/manga series from my original world. The
  series held a plethora of amazing and broken abilities from characters that
  could easily molly-wop almost everything in MHA. If this Gacha system could
  grant me abilities and techniques from that world, then nothing could stop me
  from achieving all of my ambitions. Gojo Satoru's Limitless and Six-Eyes or
  even Ryomen Sukuna's Cleave/Dismantle technique would make me invincible. If I
  could pull either of those techniques, then the sky would be the limit.
</p>
<p>
  "Use 1000 SP." I said and twisted the dial. The machine clanked and hummed as
  the bottom lid sprang open to reveal a glowing plastic ball. I tentatively
  grabbed the ball and snapped it open.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >[You have pulled: Nanami Kento's Cursed Energy Reserves! Rank:
    Silver.]</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  "Wow!" Instantly, I felt my body swell with a newfound source of power. I
  looked down at my scarred hands and clenched them into fists.
</p>
<p>
  Let's see. From what I remember, Cursed Energy, or Juryoku, is a power source
  that stems from negative emotions. Sorcerers and cursed spirits from JJK use
  cursed energy to fuel their jujutsu. Negative emotions are present in every
  human being to some extent. If this amount is higher than a certain degree, it
  grants the human the ability to see cursed spirits.
</p>
<p>
  Using that knowledge, I focused my negative emotions to bring out my cursed
  energy or CE to the surface. Slowly, black and blue waves of fire covered my
  hands. My mouth stretched widely at the sight of my new power, but it quickly
  vanished due to my brief distraction.
</p>
<p>
  "Damn, having Nanami's reserves doesn't necessarily mean I have his control."
  I looked back up at the machine and saw the number three next to it. "Right, I
  have three more pulls. Hopefully, I'll get something like cursed energy
  mastery. The Six-Eyes would be great."
</p>
<p>
  Twisting the dial, I watched the prize balls dance within the machine. With a
  satisfying pop, the lid opened to reveal another prize ball. I grinned and
  snapped open the lid, only to frown at my prize.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>[You have pulled: Nobara Kugisaki's Hammer! Rank: Bronze.]</strong>
</p>
<p>
  "...what am I supposed to do with this?" I lifted up the hammer and saw the
  small pink heart on its surface with a frown on my face. "Unless I pull her
  technique, this is useless unless I decide to become a carpenter."
</p>
<p>
  I placed the hammer inside my nightstand and turned back to the Gacha machine
  for another pull.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >[You have pulled: Yuji Itadori's Hand-to-Hand Combat Skills! Rank:
    Silver.]</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  "Yes!" I pumped my fist and felt a wave of knowledge surge into my brain.
  Jumping onto my feet, I tried to throw out the series of combos that reduced
  Mahito into a pathetic mess. But to my immense disappointment, my body failed
  to keep up with my mind. Meaning that my young, untrained body was incapable
  of performing a decent one-two punch. "Tch. I guess this means I have to train
  my body to be able to keep up. Hah... maybe I'll get lucky someday and get
  Toji's body."
</p>
<p>
  With one final pull left, I did a quick prayer to Akutami Gege and twisted the
  dial.
</p>
<p>
  "Come on, come on! Give me my Gold tier reward!" After another second of
  waiting, a glowing gold prize ball finally rolled out. Slowly, I reached out
  and grabbed the ball with a large smile on my face and snapped open the lid.
</p>
<p>
  <strong
    >[You have pulled: Todo Aoi's Cursed Technique, Boogie-Woogie! Rank:
    Gold.]</strong
  >
</p>
<p>
  "Yes!" I pumped my hands into the air in celebration but suddenly paused.
  "Hold on. Boogie-Woogie switches the positions of the user and anything they
  desire that has above a certain amount of cursed energy. Meaning that if I
  want to switch with something, it needs to have... cursed energy. Shit! Fuck!"
</p>
<p>
  I fell onto the floor and watched as the floating gachapon machine vanished,
  seemingly sensing I was done pulling for now. I remained where I lay until the
  sounds of rushing footsteps caused me to turn my head to see Keiko above me
  with a wide, excited smile.
</p>
<p>
  "Sou-chan! Sou-chan! You'll never believe who's coming to visit us today!"
  Keiko said as she danced around me. Pure happiness radiated off her, causing
  me to squint at her.
</p>
<p>"Ha? Who the hell is coming here?"</p>
<p>"It's Japan's number one hero! <i>All Might</i>!"</p>
<p>
  My eyes grew wide as saucers at her answer, causing Keiko to chuckle at my
  expression as I quickly rose to my feet.
</p>
<p>"...seriously?"</p>

<h2>Chapter 2: NO. 2 - The Number One Hero</h2>
<p>
  After drying my face with my blue towel, I looked up at the bathroom mirror. A
  small, youthful face stared back at me, barely containing the excitement
  within. My black eyes danced around as I intensely scrutinized my appearance.
  My straight but spiky black hair was combed back semi-neat, a stark departure
  from my usual wild and unkempt look. I was also wearing my nicest pair of
  clothes: black pants and a hoodie. I said nice, not fancy.
</p>
<p>"Hurry up, Loser! It's my turn!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, yeah."</p>
<p>
  I hopped down the step stool I was standing on and opened the bathroom door to
  see a long line of children waiting to use the bathroom to take a shower,
  change, or freshen up. This was not a regular occurrence at the orphanage I
  stayed in, but due to our special guest tonight, everyone was in a rush to
  clean up and look presentable.
</p>
<p>
  "All yours, my kind Sir." I made an exaggerated motion towards the door, and
  an older boy with dark grey hair glared at me briefly before stepping inside
  the bathroom.
</p>
<p>
  "Tch. Quirkless runt." The grey-haired jerk said before he closed the door.
</p>
<p>
  "Make sure you clean your ass! I don't think the caretakers can keep buying
  you more underwear!" I quickly pounded my fist on the bathroom door and
  decided to run off. The loud laughs of those still in line echoed behind me as
  an embarrassed but angry yell rumbled in the halls.
</p>
<p>"T-Thats not true! Gah! I'll get you, you quirkless little shit!"</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I chuckled as I slowed to a walk with my hands in my pockets. I knew it was
  childish of me to pick on a child, but I didn't appreciate being bullied for
  something that was out of my control. It also didn't help that I did, in fact,
  receive social points with <i>every</i> interaction I had. It wasn't just
  limited to the main players, as the system said. Although the points I got
  from everyone else were minimal.
</p>
<p>
  Now then, back to the jerk, the way he treated me wasn't uncommon, as a few
  others at the orphanage called me names for my lack of quirk. I, of course,
  took it all like a champ and retaliated in my own subtle way.
</p>
<p>
  Said retaliation involved numerous pranks and framing them for minor
  transgressions to get the caretakers to punish them.
</p>
<p>
  I stopped walking and looked down at my hands with a frown. Looking down the
  hallway, I saw a boy sitting on a chair while reading an old manga. His hair
  was composed of several hundred green worms as they danced around on his
  head—definitely one of the oddest quirks I've seen.
</p>
<p><i>Clap!</i></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  The boy with worms for hair looked over in my direction but quickly shrugged.
  I sucked my teeth and ruffled my hair in frustration, ruining my once-brushed
  hair.
</p>
<p>
  "Just as I thought, I can't use Boogie Woogie on those without CE," I muttered
  and continued walking towards my destination, which was the cafeteria. "Just
  my luck, one of the best cursed techniques, and I can't use it due to me being
  the only one with cursed energy in this world."
</p>
<p>
  I brought up my right hand and held my chin as I began to think of a way to
  properly utilize the technique with this world's limitations.
</p>
<p>
  "What if I pumped someone with some of my CE to allow me to switch with them?
  Just like how Todo infused his CE into a rock during his fight with the
  transfigured humans." I muttered and decided to head outside instead of the
  cafeteria. "But is that something I can do? What effect will CE have on the
  people of this world? Hm..."
</p>
<p>
  Opening the door, I looked around and saw no one else outside. I jogged over
  to the south side of the building, where no one usually hung around, to ensure
  I had some privacy. Scanning the ground, I found a well-sized rock in between
  a few blades of grass. Crouching down, I went ahead and grabbed the rock. With
  it in hand, I began to focus until waves of blue and black enveloped my hand.
  Slowly, I attempted to infuse my CE into the rock. After five minutes, I began
  to grow irritated at the rock and myself. No matter what I did, I couldn't get
  my CE to do what I wanted.
</p>
<p>
  "Tch, This is hard. I just awakened this stupid gacha system and my CE. I
  shouldn't be surprised that I'm not an expert at this. Todo was a Grade 1
  sorcerer, after all. So, for him to be able to switch with a rock on the fly
  is easy. Currently, I'm no better than a Yuji at the start of the series."
  Just before I decided to give up, I decided to give it one more shot.
</p>
<p>
  "Think of CE as electricity and cursed techniques as everyday appliances.
  Using electricity on its own is hard. But anyone can connect a vacuum cleaner
  to an outlet and power it on. Using that theory, all I have to do is think of
  this rock as a battery and pump my CE to charge it. I can't just try and force
  my CE into it and expect it to work."
</p>
<p>
  I closed my eyes and began to imagine the rock as a small battery. Carefully,
  I slowly pumped my CE into the rock. It took some time, but I eventually felt
  the transfer of energy go as I wanted. It was at that moment that I opened my
  eyes and saw the rock now covered in an aura of CE. Grinning at my
  achievement, I stopped pumping my CE into the rock and saw that it continued
  burning with my power. However, it gradually began to disappear without the
  continuous supply of CE from my body.
</p>
<p>
  I stood up and chucked the rock towards a far-off tree and clapped my hands.
  Before I knew it, I had suddenly swapped places with the rock. I looked back
  to where I once stood and saw the rock land on the grass, the embers of my CE
  now gone.
</p>
<p>
  "A perfectly executed Boogie Woogie swap." I couldn't help but feel a surge of
  pride and satisfaction at my successful use of the technique.
</p>
<p>
  I pumped my fist in the air and felt my understanding of CE improve. Raising
  my fist, I was able to quickly summon my CE around my arm and, in no time,
  infused it into the aforementioned limb. Walking over to the rock, I picked it
  up and held it in my hand. Grunting, I began to grip the rock in my grasp and
  eventually managed to crush it.
</p>
<p>
  "With CE, I should be able to enhance my body to improve my strength, speed,
  durability, and stamina. With enough time and practice, I should be able to
  give most pro heroes a run for their money with pure CE alone." I said as the
  now shattered pieces of rock slid out of my hand and onto the ground. Looking
  at my hand, I saw that my experiment had its consequences.
</p>
<p>
  At the center of my palm was a deep gash from one of the pieces of rock
  cutting into my flesh. The gash was now bleeding, causing some blood to drip
  onto the blades of grass below. I winced in pain, but the smile on my face
  didn't disappear as I pulled out a handkerchief from my pocket to stop the
  bleeding.
</p>
<p>
  "Maybe I could create my own cursed tool to swap with so I didn't have to keep
  infusing rocks with CE?"
</p>
<p>
  With my experiment over with, I decided to head towards the cafeteria. As I
  walked, I wondered which option I should use my remaining 500 SP on. Reaching
  the cafeteria door, I heard several loud voices on the other side. But what
  stood out the most was the loud and booming voice that sounded bigger than
  life.
</p>
<p>
  That voice! I quickly opened the door and saw the Symbol of Peace himself
  dressed in his red, white, and blue hero costume at the center of the large
  cafeteria with several large bags filled with presents and gifts behind him.
  Standing all around the man were all the inhabitants of the orphanage. Each
  one of them was looking at All Might in awe and excitement. Off to the side,
  the adults and caretakers also looked like they were creaming their pants at
  the sight of the large man, but they held themselves back for the kids.
</p>
<p>
  "Haha! I am here! With several presents for you all!" All Might said as he
  began handing out gifts to all the boys and girls. "Now, now! Don't be shy!
  There's enough for everyone!"
</p>
<p>"All Might..."</p>
<p>
  I was left in awe at the sight of All Might. Despite having read and watched
  the series, having the man himself right in front of me in the flesh was a
  completely different experience. It was as if I was sharing the room with a
  demi-god! I shook my head to stop myself from falling deeper into the mindless
  recesses of a crazy fan and remembered just who the man was.
</p>
<p><i>Okay, enough with the glazing.</i></p>
<p>
  All Might, or should I say Toshinori Yagi. The very person who held up Japan's
  society with his presence alone and the man who lived his whole life doing
  what was right. A true hero. I wondered if this is what it would feel like if
  I ever shared the same room with Superman, too. Then again, All Might is this
  world's Superman.
</p>
<p>
  But the largest question in my mind right now was why someone of his caliber
  was doing at an orphanage. My orphanage! I looked around and saw a distinct
  lack of cameras and reporters, so this wasn't a PR stunt. Not that All Might
  would do something like that. But still, why was he here?
</p>
<p>"All Might! All Might! Can I have your autograph?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I want one, too!"</p>
<p>"Me too! Me too!"</p>
<p>
  Several dozen voices began to chant and beg for the man's autograph. All Might
  looked around at all the children and then kneeled on the ground with a large,
  friendly smile.
</p>
<p>"Of course! I'll be more than happy to!"</p>
<p>
  I walked over and leaned on one of the far walls and watched as All Might
  began to give everyone who wanted one an autograph. He even signed some of the
  presents he brought as well.
</p>
<p>"How kind of All Might to do this for the kids."</p>
<p>
  I looked over to the side to see the orphanage's principal director standing
  beside one of the caretakers. Her face was weathered and kind as her brown
  hair had hints of grey. "He already does enough being one of our most generous
  donors. He really is Japan's greatest hero."
</p>
<p><i>I see. So that's how it is.</i></p>
<p>
  I looked down at my shoes and listened to the excited chatter and yells from
  the children.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >So, All Might is a large part of why we all have a roof over our heads and
    for the warm food in our bellies.</i
  >
  It was at that moment that my respect for the man grew even larger.
  <i
    >Does he do this for several other orphanages or help centers? Or could it
    be...</i
  >
</p>
<p>Could it be because of guilt?</p>
<p>
  During that horrible incident that caused me and several others here to be
  orphans, All Might was one of the heroes at the scene who helped with the
  evacuation. I wasn't saved by him when it happened; no, I was personally saved
  by Uwabami. So All Might is here to check on us or something close to that.
</p>
<p>I shook my head with a smile. "The man is a bleeding heart, all right."</p>
<p>"Shimizu-shonen."</p>
<p>
  I jumped at the sudden loud and very close voice of the number one hero as he
  stood in front of me with a kind smile. In his large hand was a gift-wrapped
  present. "I believe you haven't received a gift yet. Here, I hope you enjoy
  it!" His eyes then zeroed in on the wound on my hand. "Hm, are you okay, young
  man?"
</p>
<p>
  "Eh? You know... my name?" I said as I accepted the gift with a grateful bow.
  All Might nodded and chuckled. I then looked down at my hand; the wound had
  clotted already, and the makings of a scab began to form. "Oh, I just got
  this... playing a game." All Might nodded at my answer and mumbled something
  about kids being kids.
</p>
<p>
  "Of course I do, Shimizu-shonen. I know all of your names." All Might said as
  he looked back at several of the children as they opened and played with their
  gifts. "That over there is Fumiko-shojo, Akito-shonen, Hidemi-shonen,
  Kanako-shojo, Junpei-shonen..."
</p>
<p>
  I listened as he continued to name every single child in the room, much to my
  surprise. He got each and every single name correct. After living here with
  everyone for two years, I knew them all well.
</p>
<p>"That's amazing," I mumbled. "I can't believe you remember them all."</p>
<p>
  All Might nodded at my words and rested his hands on his hips. "It's the least
  I can do."
</p>
<p>
  "...hey, All Might." I looked up at the large man. "Thanks for giving this
  place money. I guess I have you to thank for all that broccoli they feed us."
</p>

<p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
<p><i>So many!</i></p>
<p>
  All Might looked briefly surprised, but it was quickly hidden by a boastful
  laugh. "Hah! You're welcome, Shimizu-shonen! Think nothing of it! Anything to
  help the next generation!"
</p>
<p>
  "I guess the saying 'Don't meet your heroes' doesn't apply to you, All Might,"
  I said with a grin as I looked down at my gift.
</p>
<p><strong>[+150 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "That's quite the compliment, Shimizu-shonen." All Might said with a grin as
  he looked around the room. "Hopefully, I can continue to live up to that
  standard. Being a hero is much more than just beating up villains or looking
  cool. It's also about helping those in need and lending a hand to your
  community."
</p>
<p>I smiled at him and nodded.</p>
<p>
  Who would have thought that All Might was even more impressive in person? He
  truly had a heart of gold. It's no wonder society relied on him so heavily; he
  was THE hero.
</p>
<p>
  After watching my fellow orphans have fun with their gifts, All Might nodded
  and looked up at the clock.
</p>
<p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "It seems I have to go now, Shimizu-shonen!" All Might said with a loud voice,
  gaining everyone's attention. "I'm off to continue my patrols through the
  city!"
</p>
<p>"Awh! Really!"</p>
<p>"Don't go, All Might! Please! please!"</p>
<p>
  All Might laughed and saluted us all. "Haha! I'm afraid not you all! Someone
  could be out there that needs to be saved! Now then, be sure to eat your
  vegetables and get plenty of sleep!"
</p>
<p>
  In a burst of wind that caused loose papers and hair to flutter, All Might
  disappeared in a burst of pure speed. I blinked in confusion at the sheer
  level of speed All Might had and turned to the now open doors towards the back
  of the cafeteria. Despite being sad at the fact that the number one hero was
  now gone, everyone still looked happy that he had paid us all a visit.
</p>
<p>
  I looked down at my All Might themed gift-wrapped present. I shook the gift as
  was tradition and shrugged. In one swift motion, I tore off the wrapping paper
  and chuckled at what I received.
</p>
<p>
  It was a limited edition Prime All Might figurine. On the bottom was a sticker
  that stated it was one of five that was released worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  "Heh, this is something that bushy-haired nerd would go crazy about." I
  chuckled and looked over to see Keiko dancing around with a light blue All
  Might themed hoodie. "Now then, I have some more points I can spend."
</p>
<p>
  With a limited edition figure in hand, I made my way out of the cafeteria and
  headed to my room.

<h2>Chapter 3: NO. 3 - Money? I Need That!</h2>
<p>
  <strong><i>...4 Years Later...</i></strong>
</p>
<p>
  The bustling city streets were filled with a steady stream of people, each one
  seemingly in a hurry to get to their destination. The sounds of car horns,
  chatter, and footsteps filled the air as pedestrians weaved through the
  crowded sidewalks. Tall buildings loomed overhead, casting long shadows over
  the bustling streets below.
</p>
<p>
  The occasional street performer added a touch of music to the urban symphony
  while the smell of street food wafted through the air, tempting passersby.
  Amidst the chaos, a sense of purpose and determination seemed to drive each
  person forward, creating a captivating energy that pulsed through the city.
</p>
<p>
  That was until a large explosion and thundering cracks filled the air due to
  four individuals dressed in dark outfits.
</p>
<p>
  One of the darkly dressed individuals was crashing through brick walls and
  parked cars with reckless abandon with his great strength. The man had a large
  body that seemed to be made up of sharp blue-colored stones. His heavy
  footsteps caused rumbles to rock the streets as he continued his charge.
</p>
<p>
  The next individual was covered in a black body suit as purple flames covered
  his hands and feet. Using his flames, the man was capable of pushing his body
  through the air to allow him to fly. Occasionally, he threw small fireballs at
  the cars lining the street, causing them to explode. Luckily, no one was
  standing near the vehicles when they exploded.
</p>
<p>
  Gliding on some sort of invisible flying disc a few feet behind the two was a
  woman with bright blonde hair who had a large grin on her face. On her
  shoulder was a large backfilled with money that occasionally let loose a few
  loose bills through the air as she maneuvered in and out for now panicking
  city folk.
</p>
<p>
  Lastly, A thin man with extremely long and stretchy limbs used his body to
  move over everyone below him with maneuvers resembling a slinky. The man's
  extremely stretchy limps made it easy for him to move with great speed and
  precision. This allowed him to move out of the way just in time as the Lion
  hero, Shishido, swiped the air from where he once stood.
</p>
<p>
  Shishido's hero costume resembled a lion, with long, spiky, brown hair that
  appeared like the mane of a lion. On his costume was a large amount of golden
  fur, with several spikes both in front and on his back, positioned so that
  they resemble fangs, and a black mouth with exposed teeth that resemble a
  lion's maw.
</p>
<p>
  "Hah! Some hero! You're slow as shit!" The man with the elastic quirk yelled
  as he laughed at the chasing pro hero.
</p>
<p>
  "Ragh!" Shishido growled in anger as he looked over to see the large man
  covered in a blue-colored stone crash through another car. Nearly crushing a
  woman alongside her young child. Seeing this, Shishido grew even more enraged
  and pushed his legs to go even faster. "Stop at once, you villains!"
</p>
<p>
  The lion-themed hero exploded forward and flew under the elastic villain, much
  to the stretchy man's surprise. Shishido's goal was for the woman to glide
  through the streets. But just as he was about to reach the blonde woman, she
  looked back and raised her hand in front of her.
</p>
<p>
  "Gah!" Shishido grunted as he crashed head-first into an invisible barrier.
</p>
<p>
  "Hah! Is this really what pro heroes are capable of? How funny!" The woman
  laughed as she and her three partners in crime all laughed and continued to
  run.
</p>
<p>
  Shishido shook his head as blood ran down his forehead. "Damn you, Fearsome
  Four! I won't let you get away!" He then stood up and continued the chase. As
  he ran, he yelled for everyone on the streets to get out of the way for their
  safety.
</p>
<p>
  This all happened as I leaned against one of the walls of this street's local
  bookstore with my hands in the front pockets of my black and red hoodie.
</p>
<p>
  "These four clowns are going to get away if another Hero doesn't show up
  soon," I said as I watched their retreating forms disappear around the corner.
  "Anyways, what was I doing? Right, looking for work."
</p>
<p>
  I ignored the chaos around me as people looked at the destruction caused by
  the fleeing villains and lone hero. Now, then. Despite being 11 years old and
  the legal working age in Japan being 15, I still had hope I could find a shop
  that would hire me for some cheap child labor. I wasn't particularly concerned
  about how much I would get paid as long as I got paid.
</p>
<p>
  A question anyone would ask in this situation would be why an 11-year middle
  schooler needs a job. The answer, you simpleton, is for money. Being an orphan
  didn't necessarily come with a weekly allowance. To be able to complete my
  goals and ambitions, I needed money. One of the said goals was to have a
  steady stream of passive income. The way I planned to accomplish that was to
  begin selling my own written stories and manga from my original world.
  Considering most of the most prolific and famous works from my world didn't
  exist here, it was a guaranteed way to make some dough.
</p>
<p>
  "Oh, so you're doing what most reincarnated people do in these types of
  situations? How original." I hear you saying.
</p>
<p>Yes. Yes, I am.</p>
<p>If it ain't broken, don't fix it.</p>
<p>
  Jumping over some rumble, I stopped when I saw an elderly woman struggle to
  get to her feet. Before I could decide what to do, an older girl in a high
  school uniform jogged over to the elderly lady and helped her up. Seeing that,
  I continued on to the street filled with several shops a few blocks away.
</p>
<p>
  As an orphan, I knew it was only a matter of time before the orphanage would
  no longer be able to support me once I came of age. Meaning I had 4 or 5 years
  left until I got kicked out onto the streets with nothing but some pity money
  and a bus pass. This only made my need for money even more imperative. I
  needed money to fund my art supplies and writing tools. Without those, I could
  never bring my stolen stories to life for me to sell to a publisher.
</p>
<p>
  "Hah... if only I could have gotten adopted. Then I wouldn't have to do this."
</p>
<p>
  Normally, a cute and handsome, well-behaved boy like myself would have been
  adopted years ago like my many orphaned siblings, like Keiko. However, due to
  what happened to me four years ago, my body passively releases a slow and
  steady stream of negative energy that scared away any hopeful parents from
  adopting me. Then again, most people tended to avoid me due to my negative
  energy as well. Bad vibes, I heard some say.
</p>
<p>Said negative energy was my cursed energy.</p>

<p>
  I paused in my trek and waited alongside many others for the passing cars to
  stop at an intersection. As we stood patiently, some of the people closest to
  me began to step away from me slightly. Their expressions were nervous and
  anxious. I paid them no mind. Once the cars stopped due to the red light, the
  do not cross sign changed to walk, allowing us all to cross the street.
</p>
<p>
  "Even after four years, I was only able to pull two other techniques besides
  the Boogie Woogie," I muttered as I finally reached the busy shopping and
  service center located in my city of Hamamatsu. The sound of clinking marbles
  could be heard from my hip, where a small black bag was tied to my belt. "Then
  again, I did get a lot of lesser skills and items, so I guess it's okay. Not
  like I was able to rack up the points to spend for the higher tier rewards."
</p>
<p>
  Besides the Boogie Woogie, I had managed to pull two other cursed techniques.
</p>
<p>One of the techniques was Big Bro Choso's Blood Manipulation.</p>
<p>
  Blood Manipulation allows me to control and shape my blood beyond its natural
  form or motion for a variety of effects. It can be used to manipulate every
  aspect of the user's blood, including blood composition, internal blood flow,
  plasma, pulse rate, body temperature, and red blood cells.
</p>
<p>
  The technique allows the user to control blood externally as long as it
  belongs to the user. The external blood can be hardened to create mid-range
  projectiles and or objects that the user desires. This is called Convergence.
</p>
<p>
  In the hands of a competent sorcerer like Big Bro Choso, it has the potential
  to be an incredibly useful technique. It was the skill that allowed Choso to
  stand against Uraume and False Geto for a brief amount of time. Unfortunately,
  I don't have the same potential as Choso due to my normal human body. I could
  only use so much of my blood before I would pass out. Something I learned the
  hard way.
</p>
<p>My third technique was Takuma Ino's Auspicious Beast Summons.</p>
<p>
  In order to use this technique, I had to hide my face using a mask. Which was
  the reason I had a black mask with white Spider-Man-like eyes in my back
  pocket. This would then allow me to become a spiritual medium that can summon
  forth four Auspicious beasts to use their abilities with CE. The beasts were
  Kaichi, Reiki, Kirin, and Ryu.
</p>
<p>
  Number 1, Kaichi, would allow me to summon a horn covered in a spiral pattern
  on it. I can use it as a long-ranged homing projectile cloaked in CE, and it
  won't stop until it hits my intended target, like a blue shell from Super
  Mario.
</p>
<p>
  Number 2, Reiki, would allow me to cover my body in cursed water that I can
  use to cushion myself from danger and or increase my overall mobility. Pretty
  much turning any environment into an ice rink while giving me a protective
  layer of armor.
</p>
<p>
  Number 3, Kirin, allows me to fight with a massively reduced sense of pain,
  but it will also cause my stamina to be drained away. The downside to this
  beast is when my intended goal for summoning it is completed. I'll be left
  unable to function for a limited amount of time, which would make using this
  beast in a fight against multiple opponents a risky move.
</p>
<p>
  Number 4, Ryu, the last Auspicious beast, summons a large serpentine
  dragon-like creature that will crash into my intended target to deal a large
  amount of damage. However, like in its fight against Sukuna in JJK, if enough
  damage is dealt to the dragon, it will be forced to disappear.
</p>
<p>
  It's something I don't really have to worry about here since I'm the only one
  who can perceive beasts powered by CE. Trust me, I tested it. I had walked
  around this very city with Ryu flying above my head. The most his presence did
  was give the public a sense of anxiety and unreasonable fear.
</p>
<p>
  All in all, the technique is pretty much like the baby brother of the Ten
  Shadows technique without the need to defeat them in a ritual in order to use
  them.
</p>
<p>
  These two techniques were gold-tier items I had managed to pull over the
  course of four years. After all, saving up the minimal points from my everyday
  interactions was a slow and annoying process. I had thought of ways to
  increase my social points faster, but that would mean finding any of the main
  cast members from MHA. Something that is by no means easy to do in a country
  as big as Japan while being a little kid.
</p>
<p>
  Another discovery I made once I had all three techniques was that I
  automatically had a perfect understanding of how to use them like their
  original owners. It was as if I had trained my entire life on how to use them!
  This is something I didn't realize when I first used Boogie Woogie due to my
  sheer excitement at having the technique and my gacha-based system.
</p>
<p>
  Besides those techniques, I had also pulled mostly clothes and junk from the
  show. Some examples are Maki's glasses, Yuji's Jujutsu High jacket, Gojo's
  round sunglasses, and even Geto's wooden sandals. The only other helpful
  reward I got from my pulls was Yuta's swordsmanship skills. While really
  amazing, it was an impractical skill until I got my hands on a real katana.
  And for that, I needed money. Or I could just steal one. But for now, I had to
  make do with creating a katana construct using my blood.
</p>
<p>
  Over the four years, I also trained and improved my mastery of my CE. Using
  what I knew from the series and the advice and teachings from Gojo and Nanami,
  I was now pretty proficient in imbuing myself and using CE to put me around a
  grade 2 sorcerer or so.Then again, I didn't really have anyone to tell how
  well I was doing, so this was mostly conjecture on my part.
</p>
<p>
  During that time, I also trained my body to better handle Yuji's martial arts.
  Boosting me to be a pretty decent fighter, given my current age, at least, I
  thought so. I haven't really been in a fight to check my progress. But if the
  well-defined muscles on my 11-year-old body were anything to go off by, I
  think I was doing pretty good for myself.
</p>
<p>
  "What a slow four years... I have to find someone from the main cast. I need
  to start earning some real SP."
</p>
<p>
  I released a long sigh and began going store to store to ask if they were
  willing to break the law- I mean, hire me. To my utter shock, no one wanted to
  hire an 11-year-old for some reason. Wonder why? Despite all those rejections,
  I pressed on for a few more hours, going from marketplace to marketplace.
</p>
<p>"Sorry, kid. You're too young."</p>
<p>
  "Ah, well, I don't think I can hire someone so young. I might get arrested..."
</p>
<p>"Where are your parents, little man?"</p>
<p>"This some trick? Get outta here, kid!"</p>
<p>...were some of my responses.</p>
<p>
  With the sun now on the horizon and my curfew coming up, I took a drink of my
  iced coffee and groaned from my seat on a bench. My spirits were low, and my
  motivation was even lower. The image of me living under a bridge quickly
  caused me to hop off the bench with newfound determination.
</p>
<p>
  "I can't give up," I said as I walked over to the last shop on the street. "I
  just need a few thousand yen to start. Thats it. After that, I can sit back
  and watch the money flow in."
</p>
<p>
  With a confident nod, I quickly reached the final shop on this street and
  looked up at the sign. Only to take a step back in shock at the name.
</p>

<p>Hatsume's Mechanical Repairs and Such.</p>
<p><i>Hatsume? As in Hatsume Mei? </i></p>
<p>
  "Holy shit," I uttered in surprise and looked into the surprisingly big
  shop/store.
</p>
<p>
  The inside of the store was equipped with several tools and machinery for
  repairing, maintaining, and servicing vehicles and machinery. The workshop was
  equipped with tools such as wrenches, sockets, jacks, and power tools, as well
  as machinery like hydraulic lifts, air compressors, and diagnostic
  equipment.The shelves on the walls were lined with several different pieces of
  equipment and refurbished appliances being sold for a cheaper price.There were
  a few customers inside the store, either browsing or talking to a large, burly
  man with long pink hair pulled up into a man bun.
</p>
<p>
  Off at the back was a young girl around my age with shoulder-length pink hair
  and yellow eyes. A large pair of goggles, much too big for her, sat on the top
  of her head lopsidedly. The little girl was sitting on a tall stool while
  working on a large steel box with several mechanical parts strewn all around
  the table she was working on.
</p>
<p>
  However, what caught my attention the most was the crudely drawn help-wanted
  sign on the glass window beside the main door.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >This is my chance! If I can get hired here, I can make money and earn a lot
    of SP!</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  I clenched my fist and pumped myself up. After taking a deep breath, I
  plastered a confident expression on my face and entered the store.
</p>
<p>x x x</p>
<p>
  "Sorry, kid. I'm looking for someone who knows their way around everyday
  appliances. You got that skill set?"
</p>
<p>"Uh." That was my intelligent response.</p>
<p>
  The man behind the counter, Hatsume Minato, chuckled at me and patted my
  shoulder. When he was done, I saw a few new black soot stains on my shoulder.
  "It's getting late, kid. Best you go off home before your parents get worried
  about you."
</p>
<p>
  "Please!" I placed my hands on the old, worn-down counter as Minato began to
  walk over to a shelf stacked full of boxes full of mechanical parts. "I can
  learn! Seriously, I'm pretty smart, and I can pick things up fast! I just need
  a shot!"
</p>
<p>
  Minato looked over his broad shoulder and shook his head. "Sorry, kid. Even if
  I wanted to, you're like, what? 10? I can't hire you based on that. It's
  illegal."
</p>
<p>
  <i>Damn you, Japan's laws! Why must you be so considerate? </i>I gritted my
  teeth and clenched my fists tightly in frustration. Off behind me, I heard the
  cackles of Mei as several loud clangs from a hammer echoed loudly.
  <i>Don't give up, me! Do I really have to use </i>that <i>card?</i>
</p>
<p>
  "I'm 11! Also, you don't have to pay me a full wage! I'll even accept five-er,
  s-seven hundred yen an hour! Please!" I bowed my entire body while I used my
  most pathetic and sorry-sounding voice for the most empathy. Minato looked
  over to me with a remorseful look as he carried a box.
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Hah... Sorry, kid. Can't do it." He sighed and looked out his shop's glass
  windows. With a nod, he walked over to the yellow phone that was on the
  counter and brought it up to his ear. "Listen, kid, I'll call your parents to
  come get you. It's gotten too dark for me to comfortably send you out. Some
  real sketchy people are out there these days. What's their number?"
</p>
<p><i>I guess I have to use that card after all. The orphan card!</i></p>
<p>"... don't got any."</p>
<p>"What's that?" Minato raised a brow in confusion. "Speak up, kid."</p>
<p>
  "I don't have any parents. I'm an orphan." I said with a sad but angry
  expression. "They died during the Iwata incident a few years back."
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>

<p>
  "...I see," Minato whispered, his eyes briefly looking over to where his
  daughter was working. "I'm sorry."
</p>
<p>
  "I don't need any pity or empathy." I looked up into his surprised eyes. "I
  just need a chance! Let me prove to you that I can do what you need me to do!
  Please! I don't... don't want to be homeless in a few years. So, please. Let
  me prove to you that I can do this."
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  Minato stood still for several moments and maintained eye contact with me with
  a serious expression. I didn't flinch or look away and kept eye contact with
  the large man. I didn't want to have to use my orphan status to get a job, but
  I couldn't let this opportunity go. I had to use this chance to earn SP by
  interacting with Mei. She was the only person I've run into besides All Might
  in the past 11 years who could give me the points I needed.
</p>
<p>
  Seeing as she was around my age or younger, I finally had a good grasp of
  where I was in the timeline. At most, I only had five or six years before the
  major events from the plot started. If I wanted to be able to survive and
  thrive in this world, I had to pull more Gold and Diamond tier rewards.
</p>
<p>
  Because in this world, power meant everything. I need to pull the Limitless
  technique and the Six-Eyes. With that power, I would become untouchable.
  Nothing could stop me from living the easy-going and wealthy life I wanted.
  And to do that, I had to become one of Japan's top heroes-
</p>
<p><i>...Is that really what I want?</i></p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>
  Minato closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, missing my startled
  and confused expression. I then heard him whisper something along the lines of
  "I can't believe I'm doing this."
</p>
<p>
  "Fine. I'll hire you." Minato said, reaching inside the box of mechanical
  parts he had brought over and pulled out a thick manual for a fridge and a
  large textbook about mechanical engineering. "But <i>only </i>on the condition
  you're capable of putting one of these together from scattered parts. Do that,
  and I'll hire you as an apprentice. This way, you can be paid, and I won't get
  in trouble with the law. Hopefully. You can come here after school to watch
  and learn from me so that you can accomplish your assignment. How does that
  sound?"
</p>
<p>
  I accepted the books from his hands and flipped through the several pages full
  of information and mechanical jargon. I nodded and looked up at him with
  confident eyes.
</p>
<p>
  "That sounds great. Thank you very much! I won't fail you, Hatsume-san!" I
  said with a deep, respectful bow.
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  Despite being practically guilt-tripped into this, Minato nodded with a smile
  and grabbed a blue jacket from one of the chairs near the wall. "We'll see,
  kid. Come on, I'll take you over to where you live. MeiMei!"
</p>
<p><i>Off all nicknames... MeiMei? </i></p>
<p>"Hm?" Was the pink-haired girl's response.</p>
<p>
  "I'm heading out, so I'll be locking up early. I'll be back in a few minutes;
  try not to blow up the shop. Okay?" Minato said as he guided me to the front
  door.
</p>
<p>
  "Okay! Can you bring back some more ball bearings and an electric actuator?"
  Mei called out without stopping to look at us, too entrenched in her project.
  "My adorable baby is almost complete!"
</p>
<p>
  "Ah, I almost forgot. That's my daughter, Mei." Minato told me as we watched
  the young inventor work with an intense focus. "If I'm too busy, you can ask
  her any questions. She could put one of those fridges together once she turned
  four, so I advise you to learn from her, too."
</p>
<p>
  "At four?" I muttered as I flipped through the thick and complicated manual.
  That wasn't surprising, considering what she would accomplish at UA in the
  future. "I see. I'll be sure to ask her for help then."
</p>
<p>
  "Just a small warning, though." Minato smiled awkwardly as he rubbed the side
  of his head. "My daughter is a bit... eccentric. You'll understand soon. Okay,
  let's get you home."
</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>
  As Minato and I left the store, Mei stopped her machinations and looked back
  at our retreating forms with a confused expression. Shrugging, she slid her
  goggles over her eyes and grabbed a pair of fine tweezers to twist a tiny wire
  into place.

<p><strong>Until next time!</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 4: NO. 4 - Touching Grass</h2>
<p><strong>AN:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hoo boy, 100 power stones and 17k views!</strong></p>
<p><strong>As thanks, here's the next Chapter!</strong></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>
  One of the first things I learned about Hatsume Mei was that she was a big
  ball of weirdness.
</p>
<p>"How's this?"</p>
<p>
  "Hmm, you have the green and red wire in the wrong terminal points," Mei said
  as she rolled back over to her work area to resume working on her project, or
  as she likes to call it, her baby.
</p>
<p>
  I also learned that she was much more brilliant and creative than the original
  series gave her credit for.
</p>
<p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I nodded and quickly fixed my mistake. Once I did, I saw the control board
  finally light up. I thanked Mei and received a quick "Mhm." Which was more
  than I got during my first week of working/learning under Minato and Mei.
  During that period, she mostly ignored me as if I wasn't there. Too entrenched
  in her babies to pay attention to the new individual who now shared her space.
</p>
<p>
  I placed down my wire cutters and grabbed a screwdriver to tighten down a
  loose screw. From there, I continued working on the fridge's compressor while
  keeping an eye on the control board every now and then.
</p>
<p>
  During my time at Hatsume's Mechanical Repairs and Such, I had come to
  understand the fact that I was pretty damn intelligent. Even more so than I
  originally thought. I had always thought my intelligence was decent, if not
  slightly higher than average, due to my ability to get straight A's at school
  constantly on any subject, but I never really applied myself beyond school. I
  was so entrenched in training my CE and techniques that I never paid much
  attention to training my mental strengths.
</p>
<p>
  However, now faced with the opportunity to push myself to go beyond what I
  thought was possible. I finally found out that I could apply my intelligence
  to learning pretty much whatever I wanted and quickly. If my progress in
  understanding complex engineering problems was anything to go off of. Sure, I
  was no Tony Stark, but I was well on my way to becoming a decent mechanical
  engineer, which was probably the reason why Mei had recently started
  acknowledging me as more than "Dull eyes" and began using my actual name.
</p>
<p>
  "All right, you two," Minato said as he walked over to the back of his store
  where Mei and I were working. He was using an old rag to clean his hands.
  "Time for a break. You've been back here working for three hours now. Go out
  and stretch your legs. Touch some grass."
</p>
<p>
  "No way. My baby isn't ready yet!" Mei said with a giant smile as she
  continued working on a large mechanical boot. "Can't do it!"
</p>
<p>
  "MeiMei." Minato said slowly and grabbed the screwdriver out of her hands.
</p>
<p>
  The ten-year-old inventor gasped in horror and tried to take her tool back,
  but her father's greater stature caused her to just flail around uselessly. I
  leaned back on my stool and watched as Mei continued to try to take back her
  tool. Minato then looked over at me and my assignment with approving eyes.
</p>
<p>
  "Not bad, you're halfway there. You weren't lying when you said you were a
  fast learner." Minato said as he placed the screwdriver next to Mei's project
  but quickly picked her up to stop her from getting back to work. "Hmm. Another
  couple of days, and you'll be done. You may have a future at this."
</p>
<p>
  "Ah, thank you, Hatsume-san," I said with a small smile as I rubbed the back
  of my head. I felt a little bashful since I didn't really receive compliments,
  just jeers or jokes over my being quirkless. So this was a nice change of
  pace. "It is a large part thanks to Mei. She's brilliant."
</p>
<p>
  "And don't you forget it!" Mei said with a smile as she gave up trying to
  escape her father's hold. "See, Papa! If you let us keep going, we can finish
  his baby by tomorrow! Just put me down and-"
</p>

<p>"Nice try there, MeiMei. Out you two kids go."</p>
<p>
  I got up and followed after Minato as he carried a despondent Mei towards the
  front door. Stepping outside to the bustling street, he placed Mei down and
  turned to me with a small smile. "Here. Get yourselves some ice cream or
  something. I don't want to see you two until 5 o'clock. Got it?" Minato said
  as he handed me a few bills.
</p>
<p>
  I nodded at him and placed the money into one of my pockets. "Got it. I'll be
  sure to walk Mei through the park so she can touch some grass."
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Good man," Minato said and patted his daughter's shoulder. "Go on,
  sweetheart.
</p>
<p>"But-but my baby's..."</p>
<p>"No buts. Now go on, you two."</p>
<p>
  I walked over and grabbed Mei's wrist to begin pulling her toward a park a few
  blocks away. Mei sniffed and rubbed her eyes as she followed behind me. This
  was something we grew used to doing after a few days of me starting my
  apprenticeship. Minato had discovered that I was a great way to get Mei out of
  the shop to get some fresh air. I didn't mind doing this, considering I owed
  the man for the opportunity of being hired to work for him once I was done
  with the fridge. It was also a great way to net some points.
</p>
<p>
  "Hey, hey, Souta! Let's sneak back in! I'll help you finish your baby so you
  can start working at the shop!"
</p>
<p>"Can't do that. Your father will find out, and we'll get in trouble."</p>
<p>
  "Hm, you're probably right. Okay! New plan! We sneak back in, and I continue
  working on my baby while you keep a lookout!"
</p>
<p>"How does that benefit me?"</p>
<p>"It doesn't!"</p>
<p>
  I squinted my eyes at her and sighed. Pulling her along, we continued onward
  toward the park. Much to her displeasure, despite that, she continued
  following me and didn't attempt to pull her wrist free to make a run for it.
</p>
<p>
  It was mostly due to all her past attempts resulting in failure. Using my CE,
  catching up to her was easy. So, after a while, she threw in the towel and
  decided to just give in to her fate, which was unfortunate for me. The points
  from our chases were plentiful. Soon enough, I would be able to pull for two
  Diamond tier pulls with all my saved-up points.
</p>
<p>
  After a couple more minutes, we finally reached the park we visited every time
  Minato kicked us out. We did go to other places, sometimes, like the beach,
  but neither Mei nor I enjoyed going there, mostly due to the sand. It was
  coarse and rough and irritating, and it got everywhere. Making the park was
  our go-to spot. With it being Sunday today,the park was well occupied by
  visiting families and kids around our age.
</p>
<p>
  I looked over to the familiar ice cream stand to see the stand owner, a
  friendly old man named Sojiro, handing out ice cream to several small
  children. Nodding, I turned to Mei. "Wanna get some ice cream?" I said as I
  waved the money Minato gave me.
</p>
<p>
  Despite her desire to be at the shop rather than here, Mei quickly smiled and
  nodded her head. She had a pretty large sweet tooth. "Sure, might as well. Oh!
  I want to try that orange-looking flavor today!"
</p>
<p>
  "Let's go get some then." I let go of her wrist, and we walked over to the
  vendor.
</p>
<p>"Hello, Sojiro-san. I'll have a vanilla ice cream."</p>
<p>"And I'll have that funky-looking orange one!"</p>
<p>
  Sojiro chuckled at Mei's words and nodded. After scooping our orders into two
  small paper cups, he handed us each our ice cream, which I quickly paid him
  for. After thanking him, Mei and I walked over to a shady spot under a large
  tree and took a seat on the grass. I was careful not to sit on my bag of
  marbles that were on my belt. Mei happily ate her ice cream with a smile,
  seemingly enjoying the new flavor she chose.
</p>
<p>"Hey, Mei?" I asked as I scooped some ice cream into my mouth.</p>
<p>"Hm?" She responded with a spoon in her mouth.</p>

<p>
  "What do you plan on doing in the future?" I asked as I watched several
  children playing the game Hero several feet away. They were using their quirks
  to try and attack a little boy with a mutant-type quirk. The boy himself had
  the physical appearance of a bumble bee, making him look quite monstrous. In
  my opinion, it seemed like the kid wasn't having much fun but played along
  just to fit in.
</p>
<p>
  "The future?" Mei said with a hum. That didn't last long because she quickly
  got into my personal space with a large smile, causing me to lean back. This
  was nothing new. She had no understanding of what personal space was. "It's
  obvious, isn't it?! I'm going to become the world's greatest inventor! To do
  that, I'm going to have to show off all of my babies to the world and future
  investors! No better place to do that than being at UA in the support course!"
</p>
<p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I nodded and looked down at my half-eaten treat. "UA... so that's where you
  want to go."
</p>
<p>
  Mei nodded and turned to me with a raised brow. "What do you want to do? Oh,
  oh! Do you want to join the support course too? Is that why you begged Papa to
  be able to work for him?"
</p>
<p>"I didn't necessarily beg..."</p>
<p>"Mm, yeah, you did."</p>
<p>
  "Geh." I closed my eyes at the embarrassing memory from two weeks ago and
  looked away from her cross-hair yellow eyes. "No, that's not necessary why. I
  just needed a job, is all."
</p>
<p>
  "Because you're an orphan, right?" Mei said with little thought and suddenly
  froze. A rare look of embarrassment took over her face. "Ah... sorry about
  that."
</p>
<p><strong>[+25 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I smiled at her and shook my head. "It's okay, Mei. But yeah, due to my
  situation, I needed money, so I had to get a job."
</p>
<p>
  "I see..." Mei muttered as she placed her empty cup down and pulled her knees
  to her chest. A brief moment of awkward silence hung over us as we sat.
  Looking over at her, I placed a hand on her shoulder and gave her a few pats.
</p>
<p>"Relax, Mei. I'm not mad. I know you didn't mean it like that."</p>
<p>
  Despite the way Mei acts, which is usually hyper-focused and seemingly
  uncaring for others. She was actually a pretty thoughtful person underneath
  the whole crazed inventor shtick. She just had a tough time expressing
  herself. This is a fact most would never learn due to them giving up on
  getting to know her better due to her loud personality.
</p>
<p>
  But after working alongside her every day for two weeks and knowing the way
  she'd grow up to be, I had a better time understanding and getting her to talk
  on topics other than inventing or her babies. It's how she learned to become
  comfortable with me in such a short amount of time. A fact that shocked her
  mother and father, causing them to invite me to dinner every now and then.
  They were nice people. Even when I told them I was quirkless, they didn't
  treat me any differently.
</p>
<p>
  "Then... what do you want to do in the future?" Mei asked with a rare look of
  intrigue you'd never find on her unless she was talking about her babies.
</p>
<p>
  "I want to live an easy life and be rich," I said without a hint of shame and
  laid down on my back to watch the blue sky above. A large grin grew on my face
  as I envisioned my future. Mei smiled and nodded at my answer.
</p>
<p>"How do you plan to do that?"</p>
<p><i>By becoming a hero.</i></p>
<p>
  ...Is what I wanted to say. But for the past week or so, I've been questioning
  that line of thinking. Why exactly did I want to become a hero? At first, it
  was because of the potential the top pro heroes could earn in revenue. The
  sheer amounts of cash one could make from all the sponsorships, brand deals,
  and endorsements were mouth-watering to me.
</p>
<p>So, with that in mind, why am I even debating doing it?</p>
<p>
  I wanted money, so why not go with the option that will all but guarantee
  large amounts of it? I knew in time that I would accumulate several dozen
  cursed techniques and skills from the Gacha system that would allow me to be a
  pretty diverse fighter and Hero. With that in mind, shouldn't becoming a hero
  be the obvious choice?
</p>

<p>No, not exactly.</p>
<p>
  In the series All Might, Toshinori Yagi dedicated his entire life to becoming
  the symbol of peace. Sacrificing his personal happiness and chances of true
  meaningful relationships to uphold justice and society itself. All up to the
  point of being disemboweled and having society turn on its head at the
  slightest inconvenience.
</p>
<p>
  Endevear, Todoroki Enji, became a man overcome with greed and jealousy in his
  pursuit to be the number one hero and surpass All Might. In his journey to do
  so, he essentially bought a wife so she could bear his children with him in
  order to create the ultimate quirked human to surpass All Might. Scarring and
  abusing his children.
</p>
<p>
  Hawks, Takami Keiko, was groomed from his childhood after being sold off by
  his mother to the Hero Public Safety Commission to become their perfect little
  puppet due to the sheer potential of his quirk. Not to mention that due to his
  duty to the HPSC, Hawks ended up killing Twice in cold blood.
</p>
<p>
  I could go on and on about how heroes from this society weren't true heroes at
  all. Sure, there were some that were genuine in their desire to do what was
  right, like All Might and Midoriya, but a few good apples don't make up for a
  rotten batch. Maybe Stain had a point after all? Then again, he was a
  murdering psycho who deemed himself judge, jury, and executioner.
</p>
<p>
  But still, he had a point. Wouldn't I, someone only interested in becoming
  wealthy, be proving him right? Why, then, should I become a hero if not for
  the sake of truly being one?
</p>
<p>
  So, I decided to change course. Instead of putting my safety and well-being in
  jeopardy to become a hero in the hopes of becoming wealthy, why not focus on
  creating stories and pieces of entertainment that I know will guarantee me
  loads of money? I'll still use my Gacha system to strengthen myself for when
  shit hits the fan. I don't want to get killed when Shigaraki or All For One
  starts destroying the country.
</p>
<p>
  I know some would call my decision a waste. Why accumulate all these skills
  and abilities if you're not going to use them? I was in the perfect setting,
  so why not? Well, it was because I wasn't a shonen hero whose heart beats and
  bleeds for justice and righteousness. I was in no hurry to save cats from
  trees or yell about friendship or the sort. I'll leave that for Midoriya. He's
  got this. At least, I think he does. I doubt Horikoshi killed him in the end
  or took his powers or anything along those lines. He was a shonen protagonist,
  so everything will work itself out.
</p>
<p>"I'm going to write and sell books," I said with a smile. "That's how!"</p>
<p>
  "Books?!" Mei jumped at me and leaned over my body with an incredulous look.
  "That's so boring! Why don't you just make babies like me? That's a much more
  fun way to get famous and make money! I know! I can take you on as my
  assistant!"
</p>
<p>
  I pushed Mei's face away as she was growing much too close for comfort. To
  those around us, it was starting to look like we were a bold young couple
  unafraid of getting touchy in public the way she was pinning me under her. I
  couldn't have that because I liked this park. I didn't want the people here to
  think that Mei or I were some perverted couple. I glanced over to Sojiro and
  saw him give me a thumbs-up.
</p>
<p>Oi, it's not like that, you old geezer.</p>
<p>
  "How generous. To be the assistant to <i>the </i>Hatsume Mei! What an honor!"
</p>
<p>"I knew you'd see it my way! So you accept?!"</p>
<p>"Nope."</p>
<p>Mei threw a handful of grass at my face.</p>

<h2>Chapter 5: NO. 5 - Confrontation</h2>
<p>
  At the sound of the school bell, everyone in the classroom began packing their
  stuff to head home. Some cliques were discussing what to do or where to go;
  other students headed toward their after-school clubs. At the front, the
  teacher began to organize and gather all the work from their busy day to start
  the slow grading process.
</p>
<p>
  Still in my chair, I lifted my arms above my head and stretched them. Hearing
  a few pops from my stiff joints, I sighed in relief and stood up. Grabbing my
  bag, I walked out of the classroom to head towards my job, or if a police
  officer asked, my apprenticeship. Heh-heh. Who knew breaking the law was so
  rewarding? Oh, criminals and villains did. No wonder they did it.
</p>
<p>
  It's been around three weeks since I completed my fridge assignment, much to
  Minato's approval. He was genuinely impressed that I could complete the fridge
  within three weeks of watching and observing him or Mei. He was so impressed
  that he placed me in charge of refurbishing and repairing all appliances
  brought to the store/workshop.
</p>
<p>
  It was a large responsibility that pushed me to continue learning. It didn't
  hurt that the pay was good. Minato didn't start paying seven hundred yen like
  I originally asked during our initial professional interview. No, Minato began
  my hourly wage at two thousand yen. How generous of the guy.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to my generous wage, I was able to buy the materials I needed to start
  working on the drafts for the stories I planned on writing.
</p>
<p>
  I decided to begin with writing and selling three books before moving on to
  work on making the manga I had planned. Thankfully, my ability to draw from my
  previous life carried over, so I had confidence that I could pull this off. I
  just needed to save up some more money for the art supplies I needed to get.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of my planned books, I had already completed the first entries for
  two of my books, with my third one halfway done. The three stories I wanted to
  tell were the novelization of Star Wars, Harry Potter, and the Hunger Games.
  These were some of the most prolific works from my world that had sold
  millions on their own, with successful movies to go along with them.
</p>
<p>
  When I had finished my first two books, my next challenge was to find a
  publisher that would take a chance at taking me in. So, instead of searching
  for one in person and being brushed off due to my age, I decided to use the
  internet to find a publisher. I started off by selling one book instead of
  two; that way, I could ask for much more money on my next book once the
  publisher saw how much money my stories could make.
</p>
<p>
  The Hunger Games series would be my first work as an author. With that in
  mind, I began sending the first five Chapters of the book to several
  publishers I found online under the pen name Gege and waited to see who would
  bite the bait. I didn't have to wait long because, after a few days, I
  received several offers from at least half of all the publishers I contacted.
</p>
<p>
  At that point, all I had to do was play my cards right and choose the best
  offer. It didn't hurt that I mentioned to my potential publishers that they
  were currently competing for the rights to my story, causing them to double
  their offers for my story.
</p>
<p>
  Having my pick of the litter, I chose the offer from a publisher in America
  where I would receive an advance of 65 thousand USD and 8% of the royalties
  from each copy of the book sold. It wasn't a lot, but that was mostly due to
  me being a new and unknown author. But for an orphan with little money, it was
  enough to start.
</p>
<p>
  Now, all I had to do was wait for my new publisher to begin selling my book to
  the public, which should take a few weeks from now. At that point, all I had
  to do was sit back and watch the money flow into my bank account.
</p>
<p>
  Reaching the shoe lockers, I switched out my indoor shoes for my old outdoor
  sneakers and walked outside. I came to a stop in front of a bike rack near the
  entrance of the school but stopped when my ears picked up a far-off noise.
</p>
<p>
  I looked over to the side of the school, where I saw four students walk around
  the corner. Two of the students had their arms over the shoulders of a short
  boy with a mutant-type quirk that gave him the appearance of a hunchbacked
  ogre.
</p>
<p>e on, come on. We want to talk."</p>
<p>"U-um, but I have to go home-"</p>
<p>
  "Hah? What the hell do you say, freak? Didn't you hear Keiji? We just want to
  talk!"
</p>
<p>
  I squinted my eyes where the four disappeared and shrugged. This wasn't really
  my problem, so there was no need to get involved. If I did, I could risk
  getting those bozos to focus on me due to me being quirkless.
</p>
<p>
  It's not like I don't have my own set of hecklers to worry about or anything.
  Most of what they did was call me names and petty stuff like that, but it
  never escalated from that. I mean, there was that one time one of them got
  physical, but he mysteriously ended up unconscious behind the school with a
  bag of drugs that somehow ended up in his school bag, causing him to be
  expelled when one of the staff found him after receiving an anonymous tip.
</p>
<p>How terrible.</p>
<p>
  Just as I was about to leave the front gates of my school, I found my legs
  frozen and unwilling to move. I stared down at my sneakers with a heavy frown
  and sighed. Turning around, I began to head off towards where the four
  students went.
</p>
<p>Mutant decrimination.</p>
<p>
  It was a significant problem no one wanted to talk about in this society.
  Those with mutant-type quirks were treated like second-class citizens just for
  the fact that their quirks made them look so different from regular humans.
</p>
<p>
  Shoji, Spinner, and that fox lady Midoriya saved when society collapsed came
  to mind whenever I saw these forms of discrimination. It was just so easy for
  some people to mistake those with mutations for villains on the simple fact
  they looked monstrous. It wasn't fair.
</p>
<p>"Hey, hey. Kagawa? You got any money?"</p>
<p>"Ah, n-no..."</p>
<p>"You're not lying to me now, are you?"</p>
<p>"N-no! I swear!"</p>
<p>
  I came to a stop around the corner of a rather desolate spot behind the school
  and peered back at the scene ahead. The boy with ogre-like mutation, Kagawa, I
  think I heard them say, was against a wall with the other three students
  incircling him. From their looks, they were a year or two older than us,
  making them our upperclassmen. They each had these amused and predatory looks
  as they watched Kagawa squirm under their gazes.
</p>
<p>
  One of the boys, the one with short red hair and eyes, held up his left hand
  next to Kagawa's ear and lit a small pathetic fire no bigger than a match on
  his palm. "You better not be lying to us, Kagawa. I don't have to remind you
  what I do to liars."
</p>
<p>
  Kagawa jumped and squealed as the red-haired asshole slowly brought the fire
  closer to his ear.
</p>
<p>"I-I s-swear! I-I'm not lying! I used it all up at lunch!"</p>
<p>
  "Hmm. That so?" The boy with brushed-back purple hair said with a thoughtful
  look. He was what one could call handsome. But to me, he looked uglier than a
  pile of dog shit. "Very well. We believe you."
</p>
<p>"R-really? I-"</p>
<p>
  "From now on, you won't be eating lunch. Instead, you'll be giving me your
  money every day." Purple shit stain said with an easy smile. "Got it?"
</p>
<p>"Huh? But I-"</p>
<p>
  Kagawa was interrupted when the last of the three stooges kicked him directly
  in the stomach, causing Kagawa to hunch over and hold his stomach in pain. The
  boy who kicked him had spiky black hair and serrated teeth. Let's call him
  Dipshit.
</p>
<p>
  "Shut it, freak!" Dipshit grabbed Kagawa's short brown hair and yanked his
  head up so he could look at Dipshit's angry face. "Didn't you hear what
  Nobuyuki said?!"
</p>
<p>
  Kagawa closed his eyes and tried to look away but was once again yanked by his
  hair. Tears were now flowing from his mismatched eyes.
</p>
<p>
  "Okay, that's enough." I said while I approached the four with my hands in my
  pockets. They all turned to look at me in surprise and slight fear, but the
  three bullies quickly relaxed when they noticed I was not a teacher.
</p>
<p>
  "It's the quirkless loser," Dipshit said as he walked over to stand next to
  the red-haired asshole, who looked amused. Purple shit stain looked over to me
  and then over to Kagawa with a smile.
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>"This a friend of yours, Shimizu?"</p>
<p>
  I didn't respond but continued walking toward them, causing Purple shit stain
  to frown.
</p>
<p>I have two options available to me right now.</p>
<p>
  One option was to go grab a teacher and tell them what was going on, letting
  the adults handle the situation.
</p>
<p>
  Option two was to ask these clowns to kindly stop bullying Kagawa. This will
  cause them to reflect on their actions and, in the end, make them change their
  ways.
</p>
<p>"Hey, we're talking to-"</p>
<p><i>Slap!</i></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  Dipshit's face rippled as my open palm slapped him across the face, sending
  him rolling across the ground. His eyes were blank, and a large red welt began
  to grow on his cheek.
</p>
<p>
  "I choose option three," I said as I continued walking toward the other two
  shocked bullies, their wide eyes locked on their unconscious friend. "I choose
  Violence."
</p>
<p>"W-what-"</p>
<p><i>Slap!</i></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>"Hold on, You can't just-"</p>
<p><i>Slap!</i></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  Down on the ground with red welts on their unconscious faces were the last two
  bullies. Purple shit stain and the red-haired asshole were both lying face
  down on the dirt. One of them even wet their pants. I huffed and looked over
  to a frozen, wide-eyed Kagawa.
</p>
<p>
  "Oi. snap out of it," I said and began to leave. "I suggest you get out here
  before the three stooges wake up."
</p>
<p>
  "Ah! Oh, uh, right!" Kagawa grabbed his school bag from where it sat and
  quickly caught up to me as we turned the corner. He held his bag tightly
  against his chest as he hobbled behind me. I didn't pay him much mind as we
  left the school grounds.
</p>
<p>"T-thank-"</p>
<p>
  "Don't thank me." I interrupted him and came to a stop, causing Kagawa to
  almost crash into me. "I didn't do that to save you. I did that because I hate
  bullies. So next time, stand up for yourself. Even if that means you'll get
  your ass kicked. Got that?"
</p>
<p>
  "..." Kagawa looked at me wide-eyed while his mouth opened and closed
  silently. In the end, he closed his mouth and nodded quickly.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm late for work," I muttered and began walking, leaving Kagawa behind. "See
  ya."
</p>
<p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I continued walking away without turning back to see that Kagawa was now
  bowing to me as tears streamed down his face. My eyes looked over to a
  floating screen that displayed my total saved-up SP.
</p>
<p><strong>[Total SP: 4,579]</strong></p>
<p>

    >Tonight, I finally get to spend my saved-up points! Gotta grab some snacks
    on the way home.</i

</p>

<p>
  I smiled and waved at Minato and Mei as I walked out of the shop's front door
  once we exchanged our goodbyes. Today had been another busy and productive day
  at work. Besides interacting and being subjected to testing out several of
  Mei's recently completed babies, I had finished refurbishing a microwave and a
  vacuum cleaner while fixing a toaster an old lady brought in during my
  precious fifteen-minute break.
</p>
<p>
  Usually, I wouldn't have done that so I could read up on the newest issue of
  Inventors Monthly featuring David Shield. However, Chiyo, the old lady who
  came in, was in charge of the bakery across the street.
</p>
<p>
  Chiyo always gave me a peace of bread or a cookie when I passed by for free,
  so I was more than happy to help her. Break be damned, those baked goods of
  hers were to die for! This was why I was now happily chewing on a piece of
  melon bread on my way home, courtesy of Chiyo once she saw me step outside.
</p>
<p>
  The city was bathed in the soft glow of dusk as I walked through the bustling
  streets. The fading sunlight painted the sky in hues of orange and pink,
  casting long shadows across the pavement. The city lights began to flicker to
  life, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. People of all shapes and sizes
  hurried past me, their silhouettes blending into the urban landscape. The
  distant hum of traffic and the occasional honking of horns filled the air as
  the city came alive with the energy of the evening.
</p>
<p>"Holy crap! It's the ninja hero, Edgeshot!"</p>
<p>"It's him! It is him!"</p>
<p>"Kyaa! He's so handsome!"</p>
<p>
  I arched an eyebrow and looked down the street where a large group of people
  were going crazy over Japan's current number six hero. I caught a quick
  glimpse of the guy and saw that he had the overall appearance of a traditional
  ninja, like in the original series.
</p>
<p>
  "Whats string-man doing here?" I said as I quickly looked around the area, my
  melon bread now entirely eaten. "I don't see any villain or a cat stuck in a
  tree. On patrol then?"
</p>
<p>
  Shrugging my shoulders, I decided to take a different path because there was
  no way I could walk through all these crazy fans. With my hands in my pockets,
  I made my way through a nearby alleyway. It was dark, and the air stank due to
  some built-up garbage, but as long as I could walk home unimpeded, I didn't
  care.
</p>
<p>"Hey. Hey, you. Kid."</p>

<p><i>Fuck me.</i></p>
<p>
  I sighed and looked behind me to see a shady individual walk out of the
  shadows. He was a tall man dressed in a black trenchcoat and hood. The hood
  hid his features as two white eyes peered at me from the darkness.
</p>
<p>
  "I'll be taking all your valuables." The cloaked man said in a deep, scratchy
  voice.
</p>
<p>"I think the fuck not."</p>
<p>"...huh?" The man said, seemingly not expecting me to not be afraid.</p>
<p>
  "Dude, I'm 11. What the hell do you think I have of any value? Unless...
  you're a pedophile!" I said as I covered my body, my right hand discreetly
  grabbing one of the marbles from the bag that hung on my belt. "You fiend!
  Pervert!"
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Tch! Damn kids. Just give me the bag, and you won't get hurt!" The man
  growled and walked towards me with a knife in his right hand. His larger body
  loomed dangerously over my much shorter stature. This situation would have
  rendered most kids my age a shacking, muttering mess.
</p>
<p>But not me. No, I was a Jujutsu Sorcerer.</p>
<p>Unofficially, of course.</p>
<p>
  I raised my hand and threw the marble at the man. Seeing this, he leaned to
  the side and chuckled at my pathetic attack. "Heh. What was that? A marbl-"
</p>
<p><i>Clap!</i></p>
<p>
  The man's white eyes grew wide when I suddenly appeared beside him, my body
  momentarily floating in mid-air as my right fist was coated in CE. He had no
  time to react, and I threw my fist smack dab in the middle of his face. The
  man's head snapped back from the force of my punch, and his body tumbled back
  onto a trash bin.
</p>
<p>
  Boogie Woogie is a cursed technique that activates when the user claps their
  hands together. The technique switches the positions of the user and anything
  they desire that has above a certain amount of cursed energy.
</p>
<p>
  However, due to the apparent lack of CE in this world, I'm unable to switch
  with anyone. Making the Boogie Woogie, a once mighty and versatile technique
  in the world of JJK, a limited-use technique. The only way I was able to make
  use of this technique was to switch with items infused with my CE or a cursed
  tool. Unfortunately, I haven't been lucky enough to have pulled any cursed
  tools yet.
</p>
<p>
  This is why, over the course of four years, I've been slowly and carefully
  creating my own cursed tools in the shape of the bag of marbles I've been
  carrying every day. Thus allowing me to use the Boogie Woogie!
</p>
<p>
  "T-that hurt, you damn brat!" The man said as he shakily stood to his feet.
  Drops of blood dripped onto the filthy ground from his face as his white eyes
  glared at me hatefully. "I was just going to rob you; now I'm going to gut you
  as well!"
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Ooh, scary." I slid down my black Spider-Man mask on my face and got into a
  fighting stance, CE covering my aching fists. "You're gonna have to catch me
  first."
</p>
<p>
  Despite the seemingly calm disposition I had, I couldn't stop the slight
  trembles that rocked my body. This was, after all, my first-ever encounter
  with someone who was seemingly willing to end my life. My first real fight.
  For someone who's lived a relatively normal life so far, this was a scary
  experience.
</p>
<p>
  The only thing calming me down was the bonus feature of having a relaxed
  mindset in combat, thanks to Yuji's Hand-to-hand combat skills and Yuta's
  Swordsmanship skills.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Fuck! That hurt! What's this guy made of? </i>I shook my hands in an
  attempt to get rid of the numbness.
</p>
<p>
  "Die!" The large man yelled as he closed the distance in a split second thanks
  to his long legs. When close, he slashed his knife at me in an attempt to
  slice my throat.
</p>
<p><i>Clap!</i></p>
<p>"Grah!"</p>
<p>
  I struck the man on his side with a powerful punch and clapped my hands again
  in order to appear on his left. I spun in the air and landed a kick in the
  man's face, causing the man to take several steps back. One of his feet rolled
  out from under him as he stepped on something small and round.
</p>
<p>
  I jumped back and winced. Each hit I landed began to hurt my fists or feet. It
  was as if I was striking solid stone.
</p>
<p>
  "What! They're all over the floor!" The man said in surprise as several of my
  marbles surrounded him. "Just what kind of quirk do you have?!"
</p>
<p><i>Clap!</i></p>
<p>
  "What? You thought I just had one of them?" I said as I used Blood
  Manipulation to cover my fists in hardened blood once I reappeared to his
  right.
</p>
<p>
  Before he could move, I landed a quick one-two combo at his midsection. The
  man folded over from the pain and flinched when he heard me clap again. His
  eyes looked around wildly to find my new position but grew confused when I
  didn't suddenly appear anywhere close to him. The man's head then jerked to
  where I originally stood, and he saw that my hands were now outstretched in
  front of me. Palms pressed together.
</p>
<p><i>Convergence.</i></p>
<p>
  Blood Manipulation: Convergence. This skill involves applying pressure to
  blood in order to compress it to its limit. The blood compressed with
  convergence is then released through a single point. The initial speed of
  blood enhanced with CE well exceeds the speed of sound when released. The
  secret art of Blood Manipulation has a name...
</p>
<p>"Piercing Blood."</p>
<p>
  I released an incredibly fast ray of blood straight at the man's shoulder,
  causing him to drop his knife. I could have aimed straight for the man's
  heart, but I had no intention of killing a man today. I knew this was risky,
  but I believed I could defeat him without killing him.
</p>
<p><i>Crack!</i></p>
<p>"You're strong kid. I'll give you that."</p>
<p>
  The man said as he grabbed the front of his jacket and ripped it off. My eyes
  grew wide when I saw that his entire body was covered in grey stone.
</p>
<p>
  On his shoulder, where my piercing blood attack landed, I saw a big crack
  stretching from his shoulder to his chest. The pale exposed skin underneath
  had a large bloody gash. I also noticed that everywhere else I had landed a
  strike, there were now small cracks on his skin. His face was composed of
  several large plates of stone while a pair of white eyes stared at me in
  begrudging respect. "But you won't beat me."
</p>

<p>
  <i
    >This guy is like Kirishima and Tetsutetsu... Getting past his rock-solid
    defense won't be easy. Using Piercing blood again isn't an option either;
    I'm starting to feel lightheaded. </i
  >I took an unconscious step back as the stone-quirked man stepped forward.
  <i
    >Using my blood katana against him won't work then. Where the fuck is
    Edgeshot when you need him!?</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  "I think I'm doing well for a little kid. You, on the other hand, haven't
  landed a single hit on me." I said with a confident and easygoing voice. I was
  doing my best to channel Gojo's confident personality so the guy wouldn't see
  how nervous I actually was. "Kinda pathetic if you ask me."
</p>
<p>"You got guts, kid; I respect that. But I'm ending this."</p>
<p>
  The man rushed me and threw a series of punches my way, each of which I dodged
  and weaved away from, thanks to my shorter size and speed. The man may have a
  tough defense, but it seems to slow him down as well. I clapped my hands and
  landed another punch onto the man's back, causing him to stumble, but he then
  spun around to swing at me wildly. I jumped back to dodge the swing and shook
  my hand in pain. Despite having hardened my fist with my blood, it still hurt
  punching solid stone.
</p>
<p>"Number two, Reiki!"</p>
<p>
  I felt water wrap around my body, covering me in a layer of defense. I pushed
  myself forward and slid across the rough floor as if it were made of ice. My
  opponent looked momentarily surprised at my boost of speed but quickly
  recovered. He kicked the air where he thought I was going to be but stumbled
  when I backflipped over his leg. He looked up just in time to receive a
  powerful kick that cracked the stone armor on his neck and cheek.
</p>
<p>
  "Got you." The man with the stone defense quirk smirked as he grabbed my ankle
  while I was in mid-air.
</p>
<p>"Shit!"</p>
<p>
  I was tugged through the air and slammed into the brick wall to our left with
  enough force to crack the bricks in several sections. I gasped as all the air
  in my lungs shot out of me from the force of the blow. The man wasn't done
  there; no, he pulled me out of the wall and lifted me up in the air. He pulled
  his other arm back and punched my stomach with bone-breaking strength. I felt
  myself black out for a split second as I flew back through the alley, only to
  crash into a stack of trash bins and boxes.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >If it wasn't for Reiki and focusing a layer of blood around my stomach at
    the last second, All my organs would have been turned to mush.</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  I tried to get back to my feet, but the sheer amount of pain I was feeling
  forced me to stop. I glared up at the approaching man as he walked towards me
  with a confident stride.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >Damn it! I shouldn't have hesitated and held back with my piercing blood
    technique! If I hadn't, I wouldn't be in this situation.</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  "Your quirk is something else. Teleporting and blood control! How impressive!
  It's almost as if you had two quirks! Seeing that mask, it seems like you
  wanna be a hero. Don't you, you runt? Unfortunately, the road ends here for
  you."
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  <i>Shit. Despite having three cursed techniques, I'm still so weak! </i>I
  ignored the stabbing pain in my midsection and forced myself to my feet. My
  cheeks suddenly swelled, and I was forced to lift my mask so I could spit out
  a large amount of blood. I wiped my mouth and watched as my opponent was now
  only ten feet away. Sliding my mask back down, I felt my legs begin to grow
  weak. <i>This is bad! I have to run!</i>
</p>
<p>"Now then, die!"</p>
<p>
  I looked up to see the man dash towards me with his arms held above his head,
  ready to smash my head into a paste.
</p>
<p>
  "Number four..." I held my hands in front of me in a similar manner as
  Potential Man would for the Devine General, but my hands were open and flat.
  "...Ryu!"
</p>
<p>
  The stone man may not be able to see my Auspicious Beast, but he could
  immediately sense a wave of negative energy explode out from me, causing his
  eyes to grow wide in fear.
</p>
<p>
  From my hands, a wave of CE took the form of a large serpentine dragon that
  shot straight into my opponent's chest. Ryu opened its large jaws and clamped
  down straight into the man's chest. Shattering his armor and cutting deep into
  his torso.
</p>
<p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  This was a technique that was capable of pushing back <i>the </i>Ryomen Sukuna
  in his Heian-era form.
</p>
<p>In other words, this guy was defeated in a flash.</p>
<p>
  A loud explosion shot out from around me as Ryu and the now-dead man crashed
  straight through the building beside us. Ryu kept flying even after shooting
  out the other side of the building and released my would-be killer in the air.
  Ryu vanished and returned back to me just as the man's body fell to the ground
  with a loud crack.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, the man landed straight in the center of a busy road. Causing a
  wave of panic to flood the streets. Luckily, no vehicle or person was
  underneath the man's heavy body when he crashed. In no time, a large crowd of
  people gathered around the body.
</p>
<p>"Ahh!"</p>
<p>"Is he dead?!"</p>
<p>"H-his chest!"</p>
<p>
  Due to pumping almost all of my remaining CE into Ryu to ensure my victory, I
  began to feel extremely tired. It didn't help that my injuries caused pulses
  of extreme agony to echo throughout my body. But I knew I couldn't stay here.
  I had to leave immediately. I gazed over at my dropped marbles and cursed.
</p>
<p><i>No time to gather them. What a waste!</i></p>
<p>
  Limping away, I took off my bloodied mask and used the wall beside me to
  support my weight as I left the area. As I neared the street from which I
  entered the alley, I was relieved to see it sparsely occupied. Everyone was
  too focused on the large crater with a dead man in the center to pay any
  attention to an inconsequential 11-year-old.
</p>
<p><i>Don't pass out. Don't pass out. Don't...</i></p>
<p>
  I had numbly walked in a single direction; it didn't matter where I went as
  long as I left the area of the fight. My vision was blurry, and I couldn't
  make out my surroundings. Sadly, after a while, my legs took me as far as they
  could. Like a puppet with its strings suddenly cut off, I fell to my knees and
  slammed face-first onto what felt like grass.
</p>
<p><i>Shit, I'm passing out.</i></p>
<p>Slowly, black began to encompass my vision, and I knew no more.</p>

<h2>Chapter 6: NO. 6 - Let's Order Some Gyoza</h2>
<p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
<p>
  Detective Tsukauchi Naomasa is a tall man with short black hair and
  rectangular black eyes. He wears his signature tan overcoat and matching hat.
  Underneath, he wears a black suit, a green tie, matching slacks, and dress
  shoes. His expression was calm as he stepped out of his private vehicle.
</p>
<p>
  His gaze swept over the extensive crime scene that blocked off a large section
  of a once-busy street located within the heart of Hamamatsu. Several uniformed
  police officers and their cruisers stood as a barrier to stop curious
  civilians from entering the area. His black eyes then zeroed in on the large
  crater at the center of the road.
</p>
<p>
  "Sansa," Tsukauchi said as he walked over to one of the officers standing near
  the crater with a small notepad. Lying still at the center was a white blanket
  covering a still body. What stood out the most from this officer was the large
  cat head on his shoulders. "What do we got?"
</p>
<p>
  Sansa nodded his fluffy head and flipped through several pages in his notepad.
  "At around 7:30-7:46 pm tonight, a man by the name of Uchida Ryota, the now
  deceased, fell from the sky and landed in this crater with several stab wounds
  around his torso. The pro hero Edgeshot was the first on the scene and is
  currently on a four-block search for any potential suspects. Some witnesses
  say that he exploded out from that building and suddenly fell." Sansa said as
  he pointed at the building across the street. The building had a massive hole
  in its front wall on the third floor. Rubble and destruction could be seen
  poking out from the opening.
</p>
<p>"Any other casualties? How many were injured?"</p>
<p>
  "Luckily, there were no other fatalities from the incident. However, several
  of the people from inside the building were injured when Uchida crashed
  through the building. They've been taken to Seirei Hamamatsu General
  Hospital." Sansa said, much to Tsukauchi's relief.
</p>
<p>
  "Tell me more about Uchida Ryota," Tsukauchi said as he and Sansa walked away
  from the crater and towards the damaged building. "What was his quirk? Any
  criminal history?"
</p>
<p>
  "Uchida's quirk is called Stone Constitution. His entire body is covered in a
  layer of thick stone that gave him a layer of defense." Sansa said as he and
  Tsukauchi now stood on the third floor, the Detective surveying the damage.
  "The man also did have a record. Three assaults in the past two years, and he
  was arrested for robbing a convenience store four years ago. He even assaulted
  several officers when they tried to arrest him."
</p>
<p>
  "So, a repeat offender with a strong defensive quirk," Tsukauchi said as he
  turned his head to examine where the large trial of destruction seemingly
  entered from. "That doesn't explain how Uchida flew through this building and
  into the air. Does he have any ties with the yakuza or any of the local
  gangs?"
</p>
<p>
  "We're currently looking deeper into his background, but so far, it doesn't
  seem to be gang-related."
</p>
<p>
  Tsukauchi hummed and walked out of the building by the side door. Sansa
  followed behind him as they entered an alleyway full of officers and forensic
  investigators. There were several areas marked with tape and small yellow
  cones. Tsukauchi took his hat off and kneeled down next to a cone, his eyes
  focused on the two objects beside the cone.
</p>
<p>"Marbles?"</p>
<p>
  Tsukauchi muttered with a raised eyebrow. Standing up, he turned to watch some
  of the members of the forensics team gather what seemed like blood. But from
  the looks of their disappointed faces. The blood might not be viable due to it
  mixing with the dirty alleyway water.
</p>
<p>
  "It looks like the fight began here and somehow ended up on the street," Sansa
  said as he looked over at the damaged brick walls in the alley alongside the
  several ruined trash bins. "A deal gone wrong?"
</p>
<p>
  "Perhaps," Tsukauchi said as he stared at the pile of ruined trash bins and
  boxes. Turning back, he saw the large hole in the building lined up where he
  stood. "Whoever Killed Ichida had enough power to send him through three
  stories of solid brick and steel."
</p>
<p>
  "Could it have been a vigilante?" Sansa asked as he looked straight through
  the building where Ichida had crashed through from beside Tsukauchi.
</p>
<p>"That's what we're going to find out."</p>
<p>x x x</p>
<p><strong>[Shimizu Souta POV]</strong></p>
<p>"Huh, an unfamiliar ceiling."</p>
<p>
  I blinked slowly in an attempt to remove the remnants of sleep from my eyes
  and turned my head to the side. That small action of mine caused a ripple of
  excruciating pain to shoot through my body, causing me to clench my teeth to
  stop the incoming yell of agony.
</p>
<p>
  It was then that the memories from my fight flooded the forefront of my mind.
  Reminding me of the fact that I had killed a man with the use of Ryu. It
  didn't matter that I had done it in self-defense; it didn't change the fact
  that I had taken that man's life.
</p>
<p><i>I'm... a murderer.</i></p>
<p>"Easy there, kid. You shouldn't move around too much."</p>
<p>
  Despite the warning from the unknown voice, I quickly turned towards the
  direction the mysterious voice came from, causing another jolt of pain to
  course through me.
</p>
<p>
  Sitting in a chair several feet away was a rather well-built man with blond
  hair and gray-blue eyes with no eyebrows. He seemed to be in his mid-twenties
  or so, and he had a large scar splitting his forehead. There were visible
  traces of facial hair over his mouth and at the bottom of his chin. The man's
  attire consisted of a blue-collared shirt over a white tank top and a standard
  pair of pants and boots.
</p>
<p><i>This guy seems familiar... shit! My head's killing me.</i></p>
<p>
  "The hell are you! Where am I? What year is it?!" I grabbed my head to try and
  relieve the pain as I fired off several questions to the strange man.
</p>
<p>
  Seeing my clearly distressed reaction, the man stood up quickly with his hands
  in front of him in a disarming fashion.
</p>
<p>
  "Wow there, kid! Easy! I'm friendly!" The blond man said with a shaky smile.
  "I found you unconscious a block away! So I just, eh, brought you to... my
  apartment and... treated your wounds?"
</p>
<p><i>Why is he saying that like a question?</i></p>

<p><strong>[+20 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  Despite the pain, I pushed myself up to sit on the small bed and looked down
  at my body. My entire upper body was covered in decently well-placed bandages
  and other first aid care. I tentatively touched my torso, where my precious
  organs were, and found no traces of scars.
</p>
<p><i>Phew, I still have my organs. That's a win in my book.</i></p>
<p>
  "The name's... Jin. Like I said, you're in my apartment, and the year is
  2394?" Jin said with a confused look as he scratched his head. "I, uh, how are
  you feeling? I'm not the best with first aid, and I wasn't sure if calling an
  ambulance was the right call. I don't know your situation after all..."
</p>
<p>
  <i>Hold the phone. Jin? As in</i> <i>Bubabagawa-something Jin! It's Twice!</i>
</p>
<p>
  "I see... Thank you for your help, Jin." I said with a wince as a sharp pain
  pulsed from my stomach.
</p>
<p><strong>[+25 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Don't worry about it. I couldn't exactly leave a kid lying in the street like
  that." Jin said as he walked over to his small kitchen.
</p>
<p>
  While he was gone, I took a quick look around. Beside me, I found my backpack
  that held my manuscript for my third book, Episode One of Star Wars. The
  apartment was rather run-down, with stains on the walls. There was minimal
  furniture and personal effects throughout the small apartment. Off in the
  corner were several empty beer or liquor bottles gathered together. The air
  was rich with the aroma of cigarettes, which made my nose twitch. After a few
  seconds, Jin came back with a bottle of water.
</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>
  I accepted the drink and took several thirsty gulps, suddenly aware of how dry
  my throat was. When my thirst was quenched, I looked back over to Jin and saw
  him look uncomfortable and unsure where he stood. His left hand was rubbing
  his head fiercely. "How long was I out?"
</p>
<p>
  "I think two days?" Jin said as he retook his original seat. I nodded and
  rubbed my face to help calm myself.
</p>
<p>
  "Two days? Well, that's not good." I said as I looked down at my bed and then
  at the lone sheet and pillow on the ground several feet away.
  <i>He gave up his bed for me.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Despite knowing that Jin, or Twice, would one day be a villain part of the
  League of Villians. I couldn't help but be sympathetic to him after reading
  the original story. While he did a lot of bad things throughout the story, Jin
  was by no means evil. He was a character plagued with mental illness and
  loneliness. He was a person who truly cared for the few friends he had, and he
  had proven himself to be reliable by his found family in the League of
  Villains. Only to one day be killed by someone he believed to be his friend.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >Then again, I'm not squeaky clean anymore. I did kill a man. So, in terms
    of heinous actions so far, I'm probably worse than Jin. Unless there's
    something, Horikoshi didn't share with the class for his backstory.</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  For a so-called future villain, instead of walking away and leaving my
  unconscious body wherever he found me. He decided to help me in my moment of
  need.
</p>
<p>He was a real one for that.</p>
<p>
  "Thank you, Jin. Truly. I owe you for helping me." I softly said as I swung my
  legs off the bed. I ignored the pain and looked at the surprised man with a
  smile. "You wouldn't happen to have a phone? Would you?"
</p>
<p>x x x</p>
<p>"Go on, Jin. Eat. Your food will get cold."</p>
<p>"Ah, well, alright..."</p>
<p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I smiled at the man and grabbed another handful of noodles with my chopsticks.
  On Jin's head was a hood, and the medical mask he had worn earlier was in his
  jacket pocket. I slurped my ramen hungrily and loudly, showing my appreciation
  for the chef's delicious food.
</p>
<p>
  Jin sniffed the alluring aroma of his food and finally began to eat.
  Immediately, a small smile grew on his face from the taste, and he immediately
  dug in hungrily as well.
</p>
<p>
  The particular ramen stand we were at was relatively busy at this time of day.
  Despite the high traffic, the wait was worth it for a bowl of their delicious
  ramen. As one could imagine, not eating for two days had made me extremely
  hungry.
</p>
<p>
  So, after getting dressed in my now-washed clothes, I invited Jin to join me
  in eating as a way of thanks for helping me. He tried to refuse initially, but
  I wouldn't take no for an answer.
</p>
<p>I was a persistent and persuasive guy.</p>
<p>
  One look at his kitchen told me all I needed to know. The man didn't look like
  he'd had a decent meal in a long time, so buying him dinner was the least I
  could do. I did have some decent money after selling my first book, after all.
</p>

<p>
  "You sure you don't have to hurry home? Ain't your parents worried about you?"
</p>
<p>"Don't get any, so it's fine. You want some gyoza?"</p>
<p>
  My straightforward answer stumped Jin momentarily, leaving him confused and
  unsure of what to say. Despite his silence, he looked at me with an expression
  of understanding. In the end, he just nodded, and I placed an order for some
  gyoza.
</p>
<p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  While I didn't worry too much about the Orphanage's reaction to my
  disappearance, I was more concerned with how the Hatsumes' would react to my
  disappearance.
</p>
<p>
  My excuse for the orphanage director was that I had stayed at a friend's house
  and that it completely slipped my mind to tell them I would be gone for a few
  days. By her angry voice and overreaction, it was to say she was worried about
  me. How nice of her.
</p>
<p>
  Things got dicey when I called Minato. Safe to say, I got chewed out by the
  man due to leaving him in the dark for so long. I had given him the excuse
  that I had gotten in trouble at the Orphanage, and I ended up being grounded
  with no phone privileges. I was lucky to have woken up when I did because
  Minato told me he was about to head to the Orphanage, where I stayed for
  answers. If that had happened, things would have gotten more complicated.
</p>
<p>
  When Minato handed me the phone to speak to Mei, I wasn't able to give her an
  excuse before she called me a "Big idiot" and hung up the phone. Her reaction
  caught me off guard, and I was left stumped, causing Jin to stare at me with
  confusion while I gazed into nothing like an idiot.
</p>
<p>
  "You know, you didn't have to do this." Jin suddenly said as I placed some
  gyoza in my mouth. His face was downcast and hidden by his hood. His eyes
  stared deeply into his empty ramen bowl. His right hand pressed against his
  head, and his left foot began to tap repeatedly on the floor. "I should be the
  one buying you food. You're a kid, after all."
</p>
<p>
  "It's fine. Really." I waved his concerns away as I lifted my arm up to show
  off my now clean but lightly damaged hoodie. "You gave me your bed and even
  washed my clothes, and you even treated my wounds. Buying some food for my new
  friend isn't a big deal. It's the least I can do."
</p>
<p>Sorry, wallet, you're taking one for the team.</p>
<p>
  "...friend?" Jin whispered as he slowly turned to me, his eyes wide and
  unbelieving. "Me?"
</p>
<p><strong>[+25 SP]</strong></p>
<p>"Well, yeah," I said honestly.</p>
<p>
  Despite my future knowledge of the man, I wouldn't hold what he has yet to do
  against him. I could only judge him for what he <i>has</i> done. And what he
  had done was help me during my moment of need. Who knows what would have
  happened if someone else with much darker intentions found me instead?
</p>
<p>In my eyes, Twice was a bro.</p>
<p>
  "Unless you think being friends with an 11-year-old is weird. If you do, I
  don't blame you. It is odd now that I think about it."
</p>
<p><strong>[+50 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Are you sure?" Jin looked at me, his eyes shaky and fearful. "That you want
  to be friends... with someone like me?"
</p>
<p>"Someone like you?" I asked. "Why not you?"</p>
<p>
  "Because I'm... I'm..." Jin whispered, each word causing his head to droop
  lower and lower.
</p>
<p>
  "You're Jin, right?" I interrupted, causing his head to snap back up. "You're
  the guy who saved my bacon. That makes you a hero in my eyes. So I don't see a
  problem with us being friends. Do you?"
</p>
<p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  Jin's eyes grew wide and wet at my words. His mouth opened and closed like a
  gaping fish. His mind struggled to find a response. Ultimately, he gave me a
  small smile and a nod. Seemingly not trusting his voice.
</p>
<p>"Great. Now then, how about another order of gyoza?"</p>
<p>"...sounds good."</p>
<p>"Another order of gyoza for me and my friend here!"</p>
<p><strong>[+200 SP]</strong></p>
<p>x x x</p>
<p>
  I closed the door to my small room and threw my book bag onto my small bed. I
  shimmied my way around my few belongings and took a seat on my chair beside my
  small desk. Did I tell you my room was small? Because it is.
</p>
<p>
  After a few years of not being adopted, the room I had shared with three other
  kids began to grow bigger and bigger as each one of them got adopted. The
  caretakers and director all looked at me with sympathy alongside a hint of
  fear. Over time, my CE began making them uncomfortable around me. I didn't
  blame them; I practically radiated negativity.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, they had decided to move me to a private room so I could have some
  more privacy due to my unexpectedly extended stay at the Orphanage. This
  pretty much meant that they didn't expect me to get adopted, and they were
  hiding me away in order not to scare future hopeful parents from adopting the
  other kids. Harsh but understandable. At least I got my own room now, even if
  it was the size of a utility closet.
</p>
<p>
  I leaned back on my old, creaky chair and winced as its wooden backrest dug
  into my sore back. "Man... I got my ass kicked." I lifted up my shirt and
  peeled back some of my bandages to look at the massive purple bruise on my
  stomach. "Yikes."
</p>
<p>
  When I finally got back to the Orphanage, I was greeted by a furious but
  surprisingly concerned director. The older woman must have asked me dozens of
  questions until she was finally satisfied. Thankfully, my ability to create
  excuses was unparalleled.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I ended up actually being grounded for a month.</p>
<p>
  I sat on my chair for several minutes, my expression pensive and frustrated as
  I rested my weary body.
</p>
<p><i>I almost died. I only managed to win through the skin of my teeth.</i></p>
<p>
  <i
    >I should be happy that I am still alive. Not many 11-year-olds could boast
    they managed to beat a grown-ass man. But then again, how many 11-year-olds
    have killed someone as well... knowing that, why is it that I'm so...
    disappointed in myself?</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  After having a couple of hours to think things through from the moment I woke
  up today, the fact that I had killed that man in the alleyway no longer
  bothered me as much as before. It was either him or me. And I chose me. I
  couldn't let that bring me down.
</p>
<p>
  I wonder if there was something wrong with me in the head or if I was just mad
  coping.
</p>
<p>
  "What would have happened if I was with Mei? Would I have been able to protect
  her? I was barely able to protect myself." I whispered and felt an
  unreasonable swell of anger rise in me.
</p>
<p>
  Despite being alive for 11 years, I've only really had two people I considered
  friends, three when you counted Jin.
</p>
<p>
  My first friend was Keiko, a sweet girl who was also orphaned alongside me
  during the Iwata incident that took our parents. She now lived happily with
  her new family in Masutafu. I was happy for her.
</p>
<p>
  My second friend, the wacky but brilliant Mei. If you looked past her crazy
  and obsessive behavior towards her inventions, she was actually pretty funny
  and fun to be with. Causing her to dig a place in my heart despite my initial
  intentions of using her like a point farm.
</p>
<p>
  I had tried making more friends in middle school to ease away the loneliness I
  felt, but having a constant flow of negative energy trickle out of me made it
  a challenging task. Add in my quirkless status, and my ability to make friends
  gets worse.
</p>
<p>So, not much luck there.</p>
<p>
  So the idea of either Keiko or Mei, the very few friends I did have, getting
  hurt or killed because I lacked the strength to defeat anyone who wanted to
  hurt them caused me to grow angry.
</p>
<p>Angry at myself for being so <i>weak</i>.</p>
<p><i>That fight was a wake-up call... I see that now.</i></p>
<p>
  "I didn't win because I was strong. I won because I got lucky." I muttered and
  summoned my gacha system. The floating gacha machine pulsed with power as the
  plastic prizes inside glowed with energy. Looking over to the floating screen
  beside the machine, I saw that I had accumulated 5100 SP to spend. "It's time
  I changed that. I can't let what happened two days ago happen again. I need
  strength. I need to get stronger. I have to become the <i>strongest</i>."
</p>
<p>An image of Gojo and Sukuna flashed in my mind.</p>
<p>
  I reached over and spun the dial on the gacha machine while using 1500 SP. I
  waited and listened as the prizes danced in the machine until one of them
  popped out of the lid.
</p>
<p>
  The Diamond tier reward pull only had a 35% chance of pulling a reward
  befitting the point cost. Meaning my chances of getting a legendary reward
  were low. However, the prize's bright blue glow erased any doubts of this one
  being a dud. Grabbing the prize ball, I snapped open the lid and grinned.

<p>"I don't know about this one, Mei."</p>
<p>
  "It's fine, it's fine. You're built different. I'm sure you can handle the
  knockback."
</p>
<p>"You said there wasn't going to be any knockback."</p>
<p>"...you must have misheard me."</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I squinted my eyes at Mei as she finished adjusting the pair of mechanical
  arms on my body. I grunted as she tightened one of the straps extremely
  tightly around my bicep with a sweet smile on her face.
</p>
<p>"That sorta hurts."</p>
<p>"Ah, does it? I'm sure it's fine."</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  Ever since I came back to work after my month-long grounding, Mei has been
  acting weirder than usual. By weirder, I meant she's been treating me much
  more... roughly than before.
</p>
<p>
  This made sense; she wasn't very subtle about hiding the fact that she was mad
  at me for up and leaving her alone for weeks. I had underestimated how much
  she had grown to care about me, which was odd in itself, knowing her
  character.
</p>

<p>
  Then again, I had given up on expecting the world around me to stay the same
  as in the anime/manga. The people around me were very real with human
  emotions. Not characters behind a screen or on ink on paper.
</p>
<p>
  When I entered the shop on my first day back, Mei looked extremely happy for a
  split second before her happiness melted into a blank smile. Her eyes looked
  at me with a silent message of future retribution. But when it came to Mei,
  that meant I would end up being her Guinea pig for the several babies she had
  made in my absence.
</p>
<p>All Minato said to me was, "Good luck," and left the storefront.</p>
<p>What a traitor.</p>
<p>
  So, for the next two weeks, I've been subjected to testing baby after baby in
  the hopes of getting her to forgive me eventually. Sure, her anger was a bit
  nonsensical, but she was 10. So, she got a pass.
</p>
<p>
  "Alright, remember to undo the safety mechanism! We don't want a repeat of
  yesterday!" Mei said as she took several steps back and stood behind an old
  rusty car for cover.
</p>
<p>
  We were outside behind the shop where Minato stored a lot of his junk and
  large mechanical parts that took up too much space inside. There were also
  some cars lined up outside that he worked on in his free time. The car Mei was
  using as a shield was an old 2015 Toyota that Minato gave her to use as she
  wanted.
</p>
<p>
  I rolled my eyes and did as she said. I grabbed the small switch on the top of
  the left forearm armor and gave it a spin, turning off the safety. I moved my
  arms up, down, left, and right to test their mobility. They were a bit hard to
  move, and the arms locked at times, but it was much better than the Mk. 3 from
  a few days ago. So that was a win.
</p>
<p>
  "Alright, let's see what these can do," I whispered and stepped closer to a
  large boxing bag made out of steel, courtesy of Minato. I slid into a loose
  stance and leveled my gaze on the steel bag. I heard the inner mechanisms in
  the arms whirl and waited.
</p>
<p><i>Beep.</i></p>
<p><i>Wham!</i></p>
<p>
  A small dent appeared on the steel bag from my right punch. I slid back and
  swiveled to land a left hook punch onto the bag's side, leaving a more
  significant dent than before.
</p>
<p>
  I paused and looked down at the knuckles of the arms fists and saw several
  cracks and indents from my strikes. "Okay, that's it. Any more than that, and
  they'll break, Mei." I said as I looked back to see Mei run out from behind
  her cover, a large grin on her face.
</p>
<p><strong>[+8 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Heh-heh! Amazing! Amazing!" Mei swept her hands on the steel bag to feel the
  dents that I caused. Well, her mechanical arms caused. "What an improvement!"
  She then turned to me and grabbed the sides of my arms to inspect the damage.
  "I see. It seems the shock absorption for the arms needs work. How do you
  feel?"
</p>
<p>
  "My hands feel a bit stiff, but they're not in any pain," I said as I flipped
  on the safety switch in order for Mei to start removing the arms. "However,
  the elbows were locking up between strikes."
</p>
<p>
  "Unfortunately, this is as fast as I can make them right now," Mei said as she
  entirely removed the right mechanical arm and placed it on a nearby table
  before moving to the left. "At least, if we want to avoid breaking your bones,
  I can improve the inner power regulators to circumvent the time to charge
  between strikes."
</p>
<p>"Ah, yes. Please do that. I like my bones not broken."</p>
<p>
  "Yes, yes. I'll be sure to keep that in mind." Mei smiled as she placed the
  fully removed left mechanical arm on the work table.
</p>
<p>
  She then grabbed my hands in hers while her thumbs swept over my red knuckles.
  The cross hairs in her yellow eyes grew slightly as she took a close look at
  my skin. "Hm, they're a little swollen. Are you sure you're not in any pain?"
</p>
<p>
  "Yeah, they're fine. Just be sure to increase the padding inside the gloves."
  I said as she let me go in favor of writing down several notes on her
  clipboard.
</p>
<p>"Will do!"</p>
<p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p>
  I smiled at her as she continued writing and drawing all her ideas. It was
  pretty fascinating watching her work. It's still hard to believe she's capable
  of such amazing inventions at such an early age. I turned my head to the steel
  boxing bag to look at the small dents the mechanical arms created.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >Then again, she will eventually create support gear advanced enough to
    handle Midoriya using 10-20% of One for All after all. No, stuff like these
    power arms are just the start.</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  "You're amazing, Mei," I said without looking at her. She paused in her
  writing and rambling to look at me in confusion. "These arms of yours are just
  the beginning. I know one day, your babies will change the world. I'm sure of
  it."
</p>
<p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Of course they will! Way to state the obvious, Souta! Just you wait! My name
  will be known throughout the world!" Mei said with a large, proud smile on her
  face as she puffed her chest out.
</p>
<p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I chuckled at her egotistical attitude but didn't disagree. Having an
  unorthodox mindset and a strong sense of self will only serve to push her to
  new limits. A fact that pushed Jujutsu Sorcerers like Gojo and Sukuna to the
  very peaks of the Jujutsu world.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >I have to be like Mei. I have to push myself if I want to be among the
    strongest in this world. That fight from a month ago has shown me I can't
    keep living my life like I did before. If I do, I'll get killed by the likes
    of Shigiraki, All for One, Overhaul, the Nomu, and so many other strong
    people.</i
  >
</p>
<p>I looked down at my hand and clenched it into a tight fist.</p>
<p>
  <i
    >I have to become stronger. For that, I need more fighting experience to
    improve my understanding of Jujutsu. I can't rely on the inherent knowledge
    of how to use my cursed techniques. Knowledge isn't mastery. I need to push
    beyond and reach the heights of Gojo or Sukuna. No! I have to surpass them!
    And with the power of this Gacha system, I can reach levels far beyond and
    lap them!</i
  >
</p>
<p>
  Suddenly, a stray drop of water fell on my clenched fist. I blinked and looked
  up at the sky to see dark grey clouds and rumbling. Mei looked up as well and
  quickly scrambled to grab her mechanical arms.
</p>
<p>"Ah! It's going to rain! Baby # 12 isn't waterproof! Souta, help!"</p>
<p>x x x</p>
<p>
  <strong><i>...Three Months Later...</i></strong>
</p>
<p>
  The rainy city at night was a spectacle of glistening streets and shimmering
  reflections. The glow of streetlights created a soft ambiance, casting a warm
  halo around the rain-soaked pavement. The sounds of raindrops tapping against
  the roofs around me and splashing onto the ground fill the air, creating a
  soothing symphony.
</p>
<p>
  The city lights dance in the puddles, creating a mesmerizing mosaic of colors.
  The reflections of neon signs and traffic lights add an otherworldly quality
  to the urban landscape, turning the city into a dreamlike, ethereal place.
  Despite the wet sidewalks and misty air, there's a certain beauty and
  tranquility that comes with a rainy night in the city.
</p>
<p>
  But what stood out the most to those paying attention to the rooftops of the
  surrounding buildings were the dozens of perched crows looking down at the
  streets. They watched the passing citizens with an eerie razor-sharp focus.
</p>
<p>
  I looked out at the city of Hamamatsu with a steady gaze. A black hood sat
  over my head to shield me from the non-stop rain as I kneeled on the edge of
  one of the roofs near the financial center in the city.
</p>
<p>
  Underneath my black jacket was a long-sleeved white shirt with a high collar.
  Below my waist were black jeans and sneakers while a sheathed katana sat on my
  left hip. Sitting inside a black Kevlar shieth strapped to my back was a short
  but wide-edged combat knife with a black fur guard.
</p>
<p>
  I pulled out Slaughter Demon from its sheath and held it out for the black
  crow who was standing on my shoulder. Its head twitched as if to nod to my
  silent command, and it grabbed the blade between its feet. Once it secured it,
  the crow jumped and flew away.
</p>

<p>
  Nodding, I stood up and used my CE to help me jump from rooftop to rooftop
  toward my new destination. After traveling for a few city blocks, I stopped at
  the edge of a rooftop belonging to an old warehouse. My attention focused on
  the scene below.
</p>
<p>
  "Where are you heading?" A voice said with amusement, cutting the putter
  patter of the rain.
</p>
<p>"C'mon sugar, we just wanna chat!"</p>
<p>"L-leave me alone!" A feminine voice yelled.</p>
<p>
  Down below on the dark city streets, a woman dressed in an attire fit for a
  hostess speed-walked across the dimly lit backstreets. Her dark brown hair was
  wet, and so were her slightly revealing clothes, causing them to cling to her
  curvy body.
</p>
<p>
  Following behind the clearly fearful woman was a small group of men. They
  walked after her with amused smiles on their faces as they ignored the pouring
  rain that drenched them. Two out of the five men had mutant features due to
  their quirks.
</p>
<p>
  One of the mutated men had four arms and red skin, while the other man had a
  large head and small limbs with yellow skin. The other three men all had
  normal features, their quirks most likely being the emitter type.
</p>
<p>
  I watched the woman from the rooftops as she continued to try to escape her
  pursuers and make her way in and out of several streets. But no matter what
  she did, the group of men continued following behind her. This went on a while
  longer before the woman came to an unexpected dead end at the end of a long,
  dirty alleyway, her face lighting up with fear and dread.
</p>
<p>
  "Oh no." The woman said, quickly spinning around to try and leave, but she was
  soon halted by her pursuers, who were creating a wall with their bodies. "G-go
  away! O-or I'll call the police!"
</p>
<p>
  "Please, you probably don't have a phone. If you did, then you would have
  already called them." One of the men said he had dirty blonde hair and green
  eyes. "You ain't callin' no one, Sugar."
</p>
<p>"T-then I'll scream!"</p>
<p>
  "I wouldn't. The last gall that did that got her tongue ripped out." The man
  with red skin and four arms said with a grin, causing the woman's face to
  pale.
</p>
<p>
  "Yeah, so shut ya mouth!" The man with a large head and yellow skin shouted.
  This caused the last two plain-looking members of their group to chuckle.
</p>
<p>
  "Ay yo, boss man. Ain't she a looker?" One of the plain men said. His tongue
  slowly glided along his lips. "Much prettier than the one from last night."
</p>
<p>
  His comment caused the woman to begin shaking in fear, her legs slowly walking
  back until her back hit the cold brick wall. Her arms slowly rose up to wrap
  around herself.
</p>
<p>"Five on one. I like those odds." I muttered.</p>
<p>
  I used CE to strengthen my legs and jumped off the roof I stood on and fell. A
  surprisingly soft crash rocked the wet floor as I made landfall onto a puddle
  between the men and the woman, sending water everywhere. I rose to my feet and
  slid my hands into my jacket pocket. Several moments of silence hung in the
  air as I cooly stared at them from the darkness of my hood.
</p>
<p>"...whose the shrimp?"</p>
<p>
  "Just for that, I'm kicking your ass first." I pointed my finger at the man
  with four arms and red skin.
</p>
<p><strong>[5x6= +30 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  Four-arms looked dumbfounded for several seconds before he began to laugh his
  head off. His four cronies soon joined in on the laugh as they all looked at
  me with amusement.
</p>
<p><i>Blood Manipulation...</i></p>
<p>
  "It's just some kid playing hero! Listen here, kid. Get out of here before
  we-"
</p>
<p><i>Flowing Red Scale.</i></p>
<p>
  Before anyone could react, I dashed straight at the four-armed man and sent my
  blood-covered fist straight into his stomach, causing the man to fold over in
  pain, his face twisted in agony. The man's entourage all looked so shocked at
  my sudden burst of speed and power that they remained frozen. The woman behind
  me stared at my back with wide eyes, clearly surprised at my show of power
  despite my size.
</p>
<p>
  I leaned in close to the red-skinned man's right ear, a mask made of cracked
  blood now over my eyes, and whispered.
</p>
<p>"I told you, didn't I? You're going down first."</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>

<h2>Chapter 8: NO. 8 - Pincushion</h2>
<p>Blood Manipulation: Flowing Red Scale.</p>
<p>
  It is a technique that increases the user's body temperature, pulse rate, and
  the number of red blood cells. This results in a significant boost in energy
  and physical abilities, allowing the user to perform superhuman feats such as
  increased strength, speed, and agility.
</p>
<p>
  The enhanced strength and speed granted by Flowing Red Scale can be used to
  boost the user's capabilities in hand-to-hand combat.
</p>
<p>Making a knowledgeable fighter a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>
  Jumping to the side, I was able to dodge the red-skinned man's pair of
  well-muscled arms with ease. He growled in anger and swung at me again but
  once again hit nothing but air as I took a back step. His eyes twitched at the
  fact he was too slow and uncoordinated to hit me. His red skin glistened in
  the dim light, a stark contrast to his black, tattered clothes.
</p>
<p><strong>[+8 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Grr! Help me, you idiots!" The four-armed man roared to his crew, jolting
  them all to action.
</p>
<p>"R-right!"</p>
<p>"We got your back, boss!"</p>
<p>"Tch! This ain't no kid! He's too fast and strong!"</p>
<p>
  I rolled my eyes from under the darkness of my hood and raised my arms in
  front of me in a loose boxer's stance. The four-armed man held his stomach and
  took a back seat to watch three of his crew dash towards me with the
  large-headed man hanging back. He looked down at his stomach and saw a dark
  red bloody spot that slowly disappeared, causing him great confusion.
</p>
<p>
  "You'll regret this, you bastard!" One of the plain-looking men pulled his arm
  back and threw a sloppy punch at my head.
</p>
<p>
  <i>His teeth are all different colors. </i>I observed and parried his punch to
  the side, causing the man to trip. I jumped up and crashed my elbow into the
  side of his head. Sending him to the ground, unconscious.
  <i
    >Huh, now they're all yellow. His emotions must be why his teeth change
    colors. What a dumb quirk.</i
  >
</p>
<p><strong>[+8 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+8 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Nishi!" Plain man #2 yelled as he and Plain man #3 looked down at their
  friend. The two of them then charged at me, their faces twisted into rage.
  "You'll pay for that!"
</p>
<p>
  Despite their larger size and numbers, I was able to move in and out from
  their strikes and kicks with ease. These two men were untrained and relied
  heavily on their numbers to overpower me. Someone with decent training could
  keep up with them thanks to how they telegraphed each swing or blow.
</p>
<p>
  The man to my left seemed to have a quirk that gave him super long fingernails
  on command, and the one on my right seemingly had a quirk that gave him extra
  joints in his skeleton. Their pathetic quirks didn't even offer them any buffs
  or attack power.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, they were up against someone amped up with Flowing Red Scale
  and with Itadori Yuji's hand-to-hand combat skills. Mr. left-right-goodnight
  himself!
</p>
<p><i>Blam! Crack!</i></p>
<p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  The two men fell onto the ground like bags of bricks from my swift,
  well-placed punches and kicks to their heads. I looked at my three knocked-out
  opponents with disappointment.
</p>

<p>
  "You done hiding behind your lackeys?" I said towards the four-armed man. The
  one with the large head and yellow skin shook in annoyance from where he
  stood. "How pathetic."
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>"Take this! Wave of might!"</p>
<p>
  The man with the large head sent out his right hand towards me. His hand was
  covered in a golden hue of energy, and his palm was pointed in my direction.
  In the blink of an eye, a large concentration burst of energy flew straight at
  me, causing my eyes to grow wide.
</p>
<p><i>Shit! No time to dodge!</i></p>
<p>
  I raised my arms in front of me and concentrated my CE throughout my body to
  reinforce myself. The energy burst slammed into my body and sent me skidding
  back several feet. I dug my feet into the ground and immediately began to slow
  down.
</p>
<p>
  I slid to a stop beside the woman at the end of the dead end. She looked at me
  with worry and slight trepidation as I dropped my arms beside me. I ignored
  her in favor of analyzing the large-headed man's quirk.
</p>
<p>
  <i
    >Before he unleashed that attack, he was holding his arm behind his back to
    hide what he was doing. In fact, he was doing that during my fight with the
    three bozos. That means his attack needs to be charged before he can use it.
    Therefore I-</i
  >
</p>
<p>"U-um, are you okay-"</p>
<p>"Be silent."</p>
<p><i>Silence you, wench! I'm thinking!</i></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  The curvy woman flinched at my quick and rude comment. I paid her no mind and
  stepped forward to begin walking toward my last two opponents, causing the
  nervous, yellow-skinned man to flinch. It seemed that he didn't expect me to
  be able to tank his attack. Immediately, he pulled his arm behind himself to
  charge up another attack.
</p>
<p><i>As if I'd let you. What do you think this is? Dragon ball?</i></p>
<p>
  I exploded towards the large-headed man, causing him to flinch and break his
  concentration momentarily. Just as I was about to reach the bobblehead, Four
  Arms decided it was time to get back into the fight.
</p>
<p>
  Four Arms grunted and used both of his right arms in an attempt to punch my
  head through the wall behind me, only to miss as I weaved under his attack.
  Using a quick back step, I created some space between me and the large mutant.
  He then stepped in front of his large-headed companion and shifted into a Mui
  Thai stance.
</p>
<p>"Damn, you. Just who are you?!" Four Arms growled out.</p>
<p>
  Instead of answering, I rushed to the red-skinned man and delivered a right
  CE-enhanced punch that he quickly blocked. I tilted my head to the side and
  felt the wind from his left jab slice next to my ear. Using my short height, I
  stepped into his personal space and landed a hook punch into my opponent's
  liver.
</p>
<p>
  Four Arms clenched his teeth in pain and was about to smash his upper arms
  onto my head when an invisible force crashed into his liver again, knocking
  him off balance.
</p>
<p>
  "Divergent Fist," I muttered as I dashed after Four Arms. Leaping into the
  air, I landed three snap kicks onto my opponent's head, chest, and stomach.
  Thanks to my Divergent Fist, each attack had a delayed second impact.
</p>
<p>
  Four Arms violently spun in the air from my attack and fell in a puddle below.
  As his body slammed on the floor, a large, victorious grin grew on his face. I
  felt the hair on my body stand up, and I quickly looked over at Mr.
  Bobblehead.
</p>
<p>"Wave of might!"</p>
<p><i>Shit, so much for sticking only to Blood Manipulation.</i></p>
<p>
  Just as the wave of yellow energy was about to slam into me, I held my palm
  towards the ground and shot out a concentrated burst of flames that
  illuminated everything in the dead end. I felt my body violently jerk upwards
  as I moved out of the way of Mr. Bobblehead's attack.
</p>
<p>"F-fire?!" Mr. Bobblehead screeched as he saw his attack miss.</p>

<p><strong>[+8 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I landed on the ground with ease and looked over to see Four Arms now on his
  feet. A look of apprehension and nervousness on his face; behind him, Mr.
  Bobblehead was shaking like a leaf.
</p>
<p>
  "Those f-flames. Aren't they like Endeavor's!" Mr. Bobblehead muttered, his
  face covered in rain and sweat. Four Arms growled and began running full speed
  toward me.
</p>
<p>
  "Don't be ridiculous! This punk just has a fire quirk! Hurry up and recharge-"
</p>
<p>
  "I don't think so." I held up my hands and swiped them to the side. Four Arms
  suddenly jerked to the side and flew straight into Mr. Bobblehead. The two men
  rolled on the ground in a heap of flailing limbs.
</p>
<p>"M-my body." Four Arms muttered as he trembled. "It h-hurts!"</p>
<p>
  "Tajima-san! What's the matter?!" Mr. Bobblehead asked Four Arms, er, Tajima,
  as he watched the four-armed man shake uncontrollably on the ground. Blood
  began to spill out of Tajima's mouth and eyes as he convulsed on the ground.
</p>
<p>
  "<i>Much prettier than the one from last night</i>," I said as I continued
  pointing my hand at Tajima, repeating what one of the plain men said earlier.
  "That's what your buddy said, right?" Slowly, I clenched my hand tighter and
  tighter, but not to the point of closing my fingers into a fist.
</p>
<p>
  My action caused Tajima to hold his stomach tightly as he screamed bloody
  murder. "You see, I don't particularly like people like you guys. Rapists and
  the like. So, I'll do the world a favor and just get rid of you five. Kay?"
</p>
<p>
  For a moment, I hesitated in what I was about to do next. I looked behind me
  at the frightened woman and imagined what could have happened to her if I
  hadn't decided to go on my crusade to get stronger. She could have been raped,
  beaten, or even killed by these rabid dogs. I took a deep breath and steeled
  my resolve.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, unknown to me, a piece of my humanity shriveled within me.
</p>
<p>"Blood Manipulation: Human Pincushion."</p>
<p>
  Human Pincushion was the first original technique I created with my Blood
  Manipulation curse technique.
</p>
<p>
  It requires me to inject my own blood into my opponent's bloodstream, imbued
  with a layer of CE. The layer of CE protects my blood from being deluded or
  absorbed into my opponent's body, meaning that it will lay in wait until I
  reach out to it and command it to do whatever I wish. Whether that be to
  restrict their movements or to shred their insides into pieces.
</p>
<p>
  To finish off the technique, I command my blood to exponentially expand like a
  short-range explosion similar to a grenade, sending long spikes of blood
  throughout my target's body.
</p>
<p>
  Once I called out the name of my first original technique, I made a fist, and
  spikes of my blood shot out of Tajima's body, causing him to look like a
  bloody pincushion. His face was twisted in agony until it finally relaxed.
  Blood slowly leaked out of his body, mixing in with the large puddle of dirty
  water underneath him.
</p>
<p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[+12 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Agh! Y-you-you killed him!" Mr. Bobblehead yelled as he quickly stood up and
  began to run away. "Leave me alone!" As he ran, he saw a lone crow at the end
  of the long alleyway. But what confused him the most was the combat knife
  underneath its tiny legs. The small bird cawed and swiftly flew away.
</p>
<p>
  "Funny. That's what she said, too." I said as I motioned to the woman behind
  me, who was now on the ground on her knees. Her face was etched into shock and
  horror at my actions.
</p>
<p><strong>[+8 SP]</strong></p>
<p>I ignored the woman and raised my hands.</p>
<p><i>Clap!</i></p>
<p>
  I suddenly appeared where the dropped combat knife once sat, causing Mr.
  Bobblehead's eyes to grow wide and his mouth to open in horror. I held my
  right fist in my left hand as I charged up my CE. Due to his body shape and
  head size, Mr. Bobblehead was unable to slow his speed and stop his run,
  causing him to trip right in front of me.
</p>

<p><i>Wham!</i></p>
<p>
  My punch struck true as it broke Mr. Bobblehead's nose and sent him crashing
  back a dozen feet. His broken nose sprayed blood all along the dirty, wet
  ground. Once he rolled to a stop, his body twitched a few times until it
  stilled into unconsciousness.
</p>
<p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  "Damn it." I looked down at my bloodied and bruised right fist with a frown.
  "I thought I would have gotten it that time for sure."
</p>
<p>
  I have been trying to achieve a Black Flash for the past two months, and so
  far, I've failed at achieving a single one. I needed to reach the sparks of
  black in order to further push my understanding of the essence of cursed
  energy.
</p>
<p>But so far, no luck.</p>
<p>
  I sighed in frustration and walked down the alleyway; as I did, I passed by
  the four knocked-out men and one corpse. Reaching my newly acquired weapon,
  Slaughter Demon, I bent down and slid it back into its holster.
</p>
<p>
  Standing up, I noticed the woman I inadvertently saved stare at me with a dumb
  expression.
</p>
<p>
  "Why are you still here?" I asked the frozen woman. My voice snapped her out
  of her daze, causing her head to spin to me with fear. "Get the hell out of
  here already."
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>"I-uh... I don't..." The woman said shakily before standing to her feet.</p>
<p>
  At first, she took a few small, unsure steps, her eyes scanning all the downed
  men and dead bodies before turning to me. She looked scared but somehow
  relieved at the same time. Without saying another word, she ran out of the
  alley and disappeared around the corner.
</p>
<p>
  I looked up towards the rooftops where three crows were perched. Their eyes
  were looking down at me with loyalty.
</p>
<p>
  "Follow her. Make sure she gets home." I called out, causing one of the crows
  to caw.
</p>
<p>(I, Geto, will make sure that monkey- I mean, human- reaches her nest.)</p>
<p>
  I nodded at the crow I named Geto as he flapped his wings and flew away. I
  scratched the back of my head as I still couldn't get over the fact that I was
  now able to understand what the crows under my command said.
</p>
<p>
  It was an odd experience; being able to speak to my crows wasn't something I
  thought my recently pulled cursed technique, Black Bird Manipulation, could
  also do.
</p>
<p>Don't even ask me how they got their namesake personalities.</p>
<p>Was MeiMei able to understand her birds as well?</p>
<p>If so, that's a fact Gege hid from us all. How dare he.</p>
<p>
  (Standing around here has gotten boring, so I'll come along. Maybe I'll even
  fly into a hawk to fight? Heh, it won't even be a fight. I'll take it down
  quickly! I am the strongest, after all.) Crow Gojo said as he followed behind
  Crow Geto.
</p>
<p>
  The crow beside Crow Gojo, Crow Shoko, shook her head before looking down at
  me from her perch.
</p>
<p>(Haa... I'll make sure they don't get distracted, Master.)</p>
<p>"...right, you do that,"</p>
<p>
  Crow Shoko nodded her little head and flew off. I watched them all fly away
  and turned to the unconscious men on the floor.
</p>
<p>With a heavy heart, I raised my hand up and summoned a fire ball.</p>
<p>"Let's clean up this mess."</p>

  <h2>Chapter 9: NO. 9 - Productive Three Months</h2>
  <p>
    Jumping from rooftop to rooftop in the dead of night like a parkouring ninja
    was pretty fun.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to the size of the country, almost all of the living complexes, like
    apartments or houses, had to be built pretty close to one another in order
    to save space. This also applied to the metropolitan areas in the cities
    where all the buildings and skyscrapers were practically stuck to one
    another to save space.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yeah, there were some areas in the country where there were more spaced-out
    buildings like those made for the government or private organizations, but
    those weren't that common to run into.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to that, traveling from rooftop to rooftop on foot was pretty easy since
    you don't have to leap across large distances to get to the other side.
    Making traveling from Ward to Ward all the more easy.
  </p>
  <p>"Should start heading home now."</p>
  <p>
    I leaped in the air using my CE and felt the cool night air brush past my
    face. It felt nice and refreshing.
  </p>
  <p>Three months.</p>
  <p>
    It's been three months since I've embarked on my quest to master jujutsu.
    This journey has led me to engage in nightly skirmishes with the less savory
    elements of our heroic society. The city is teeming with criminals and
    scoundrels, outnumbering the heroes three to one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, some of you might be wondering why an 11, now 12-year-old kid would go
    around getting into fights with grown-ass adults. The answer is simple: for
    experience.
  </p>
  <p>
    My path to mastering jujutsu sorcery and my curse techniques is not an easy
    one. I've meticulously planned my physical training, ensuring that my new,
    more strenuous routine doesn't impede my growth. Rushing would be
    counterproductive. It wouldn't do me any good to hinder my development just
    to get a teeny bit stronger than before. I still had time, so there was no
    need to rush.
  </p>
  <p>I didn't want to risk being short after all.</p>
  <p>
    Anyways, back to what I was talking about. My reasoning as to why I was
    getting into fights was to increase my fighting experience and my
    understanding of jujutsu sorcery. My goal was to get to the point of
    understanding jujutsu like Sukuna himself while having the battle IQ of Gojo
    himself.
  </p>
  <p>
    My goals may seem lofty, even unattainable to most canon jujutsu sorcerers.
    But I'm not most sorcerers. I'm different.
  </p>
  <p>I was <i>him.</i></p>
  <p>I was <i>that</i> guy.</p>
  <p>Or at least, I would be soon.</p>
  <p>
    I blinked out of my thoughts and landed in an abandoned alleyway a block or
    two from my orphanage in order to change. I stuffed my jujutsu uniform away
    and put on a black hoodie and blue jeans. Now changed, I walked out onto the
    sidewalk and began walking home.
  </p>
  <p>Yup, just a 12-year-old walking alone at 2 am.</p>
  <p>Now then, where was I...</p>
  <p>
    I had a cheat, or as some would call it, a golden finger, that could give me
    every known cursed technique in the original series without the blowback.
    Making my potential even more significant than that of Potential Man
    himself. It wouldn't be far-fetched to say that I could one day become an
    untouchable God.
  </p>
  <p>
    Just imagine the sheer power of someone with the Six Eyes, Sukuna's cursed
    energy reserves, Limitless, the Ten Shadows, Shrine, and Star Rage could do.
    It was both frightening and exciting to think about.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some of you may have noticed I only listed four techniques. There's a reason
    for that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, I made a disappointing discovery when I unlocked my fifth
    cursed technique. I was only able to use four techniques within 2 hours of
    each other. Let's see, let's explain this in video game terms. Let's say my
    body has four magic slots into which I could assign a single curse
    technique. If I wanted to change one of the techniques, I had to wait two
    hours for one of the slots to cool down in order to switch that technique to
    a different one.
  </p>
  <p>
    Out of curiosity, I pushed myself to use five techniques at once, but I
    didn't like having blood flow out of my eyes, nose, ears, and mouth while
    the most horrible headache tried to melt my brain. Safe to say, I'm sticking
    to four curse techniques until I can safely handle more.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Despite that slight hiccup, it wouldn't do me any good imagining what I
    could one day be able to do until I actually pulled those techniques and
    passives from the gacha system.
  </p>
  <p>
    So far, I've yet to pull any of the aforementioned techniques. But I have
    managed to pull some other great techniques so far.
  </p>
  <p>
    I now had Jogo's Fire Manipulation, Yorozu's Construction, MeiMei's Black
    Bird Manipulation, and finally, Goda Toshio's Cloning.
  </p>
  <p>
    Who was Goda Toshio? That was the name for Mr. Bagman from the hidden
    inventory arc in JJK.
  </p>
  <p>
    I do want to dispel one thing right now: Jogo's Fire Manipulation and
    Yorozu's Construction did not make me OP. At least, not yet.
  </p>
  <p>
    No, Jogo was said to be on par with around 8 or 9 of Sukuna's fingers.
    Making him an incredibly powerful curse spirit. Heck, his fight with Sukuna
    himself at Shibuya was the perfect example of what one with such a technique
    could do.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, Jogo was a special-grade curse spirit with a lot of cursed energy.
  </p>
  <p>I, on the other hand, have the reserves of a grade 1 sorcerer.</p>
  <p>
    Which means I had no hopes of pulling off any crazy and over-the-top moves
    that could melt an entire city block.
  </p>
  <p>
    Moving on to Yorozu's Construction technique. It was by far one of the most
    impressive and diverse techniques in the catalog of curse techniques.
  </p>
  <p>
    The technique itself allows me to re-create <i>any</i> substance I recognize
    with CE, with the exception of special cursed tools. In other words, I could
    bring to life anything I could imagine! The sheer limitless number of
    possibilities was enough to cause me to laugh like a madman!
  </p>
  <p>
    Which I did when I initially pulled the technique from a diamond pull, which
    happened to be at school. I was looked at as if I was a crazy person for an
    entire week after that.
  </p>
  <p>
    The technique had one restriction, which was that it did not recreate
    special cursed tools. That aspect of the technique was a little
    disappointing. My plans of creating a small armory of my two tools went out
    the window. Said two tools were Kusakabe's Katana and Slaughter Demon. Two
    weapons that went well with Maki's weapon mastery skill, which I pulled a
    while ago, as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Back to the technique, creating something from nothing uses a lot of cursed
    energy, making this technique extremely energy-inefficient compared to other
    cursed techniques. However, due to my relatively okay reserves and low
    understanding of jujutsu, the most I could create before exhausting myself
    for an entire day were small-medium items.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was rather sad and disappointing; not being able to become a heavy
    hitter immediately was annoying, but there was nothing I could do. I had to
    keep training to be able to one day use these techniques to their maximum
    potential.
  </p>
  <p>This brings us back to my last two techniques.</p>
  <p>Black Bird Manipulation and Cloning.</p>
  <p>
    As the name suggests, Black Bird Manipulation allows the user to imbue crows
    with CE and control them at will. The user can manipulate multiple crows at
    the same time from an extended range away from themselves.
  </p>
  <p>
    Additionally, the user can also share vision with the birds, making the
    technique perfect for surveillance. It also makes the crows, under the
    user's command, absolutely obedient, so they can also be used offensively,
    even at the cost of the bird's own life.
  </p>
  <p>
    That move was something I didn't find myself ever using unless it was life
    or death. This was primarily due to the mistake I made when I began naming
    my crows after several JJK characters and the bonus ability to understand
    what they were saying. It would be cruel and heartless of me to use them
    like MeiMei did as suicide bombers.
  </p>
  <p>
    I used this particular technique to scour the city to find any seedy
    locations crawling with people to beat up-I mean, criminals to stop. It also
    helped me avoid any patrolling heroes and police as well. A convenient
    technique indeed.
  </p>
  <p>
    I arrived outside of the orphanage's west building and began sneakily making
    my way over to the window of the storage room; I mean, my room was located
    using precise movements and stealth.
  </p>
  <p>
    As I sneaked around, I thought of my last acquired technique. Bag man's
    Cloning.
  </p>
  <p>
    This technique allows the user to clone themselves using a kind of mud-like
    liquid material manipulated with their CE. The user can produce up to four
    clones for a total of five bodies. Using the cloned bodies, the user can
    instantly change out their real one with a clone at any time, sorta like
    Boogie Woogie but without the clapping.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every clone can be considered exactly identical to the original caster, with
    the exception of the clones knowing their clones. Which was a relief when I
    found out that little tidbit. I didn't want a Twice situation to happen.
  </p>
  <p>
    I haven't had many opportunities to use this ability in combat as of yet. If
    anything, I wanted to save this technique as my trump card for a rainy day.
    You never know when you might need a get-out-of-jail-free card. So, instead
    of using it on the field, I decided to use my clones for a more productive
    and lucrative reason...
  </p>
  <p>"Page seven is done! I'm ready to ink the next one!"</p>
  
  <p>"Got it, got it. Here's page eight and nine."</p>
  <p>"Dude, there's a typo on Chapter twenty-one."</p>
  <p>"Oh yeah? Then fix it."</p>
  <p>I used them to write up my books and manga!</p>
  <p>
    Stepping into my room, I closed the door behind me and congratulated myself
    on another successful infiltration. The sight of four other perfect copies
    of myself greeted me as they all were hard at work on their assignments.
    Seeing my arrival, they all paused and turned to me.
  </p>
  <p>"Ah, the boss is back."</p>
  <p>"Welcome back, Boss!"</p>
  <p>"Oi, you got some blood on your shoe."</p>
  <p>"You smell like failure. No Black Flash tonight either?"</p>
  <p>
    <i>I could do without the personalities these guys have.</i> I rolled my
    eyes at their comments and threw myself on my small bed. They didn't mind my
    dismissal and got back to work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each of my copies was wearing different colored shirts to separate
    themselves better as they all slaved away. Two of my copies were typing away
    on books 2 and 3 of The Hunger Games on their new laptops, while the other
    two were drawing up a storm for next week's Chapter of my new serialized
    manga.
  </p>
  <p>
    What was so great about these clones, besides their snarky comments and the
    fact that my small room was now even smaller thanks to their bodies and all
    the art supplies and notebooks, was the fact that they didn't get tired or
    have any human needs!
  </p>
  <p>
    This technique really came in handy, considering I still needed to make
    money while training myself to become the strongest, which means that I
    could have them work on all my current and future books and manga series
    without stopping. A perfect and productive child sweatshop!
  </p>
  <p>
    "Oi, boss. Our editor called while you were gone." Clone Green said as he
    stopped drawing. Clone Yellow nodded and inked away at the page in front of
    him. I turned to CG with tired eyes and nodded, causing him to continue.
    "She says she wants to meet you and that she won't take no for an answer
    again."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Tch. That woman sure is persistent." I muttered as I rubbed my face. "Fine!
    Fine! I'll call her tomorrow to set up a meeting. As long as I can get her
    off my back. One meeting shouldn't hurt."
  </p>
  <p>
    CG nodded and picked up his pencil to continue sketching away. I sighed and
    looked up at the roof. The exhaustion from today's shenanigans and training
    is catching up to me. Slowly, my eyelids began to grow heavier and heavier
    before sleep consumed me.
  </p>
  <p>"Oi, Boss. Brush your teeth."</p>

<h2>Chapter 10: NO. 10 - School, Games, and The Crawler</h2>
<p>
  "No way, man! I can't believe it ended in such a cliffhanger!" A young middle
  schooler with four eyes and large ears said with an excited smile as he closed
  this week's edition of Jump.
</p>
<p>
  "I know, right?! Now we have to wait another week to see if Raphael can
  survive his fight against Karai." A blue-skinned boy with fish scales all over
  his body said with frustration. In his hands was another copy of the newest
  Jump.
</p>
<p>
  "Hey, at least we can read Gege-sensei's other works while we wait. What
  Chapter are you on anyway?"
</p>
<p>
  "I'm on Chapter 18. Let me tell you, man, things are getting intense." The boy
  with the fish scales said as he pulled out a copy of The Hunger Games.
</p>
<p><i>Heheh, my reach has grown to even here.</i></p>
<p>
  I grinned as my classmates continued talking about my book from my spot at the
  back of the class. It was currently lunchtime, and everyone was separated into
  their own little groups, enjoying their food together.
</p>
<p>
  I, however, sat alone. Just me and my small boxed lunch comprising of rice,
  grilled fish, vegetables, and some miso soup. All I needed was my lunch for
  the company. Who needed friends while you had some delicious miso soup?
</p>
<p>Not me, that's who.</p>
<p>
  As I ate, I looked over to the table where the chattering students talked and
  saw an image of four turtle brothers on the main cover alongside the rest of
  the included stories' main characters.
</p>
<p>
  It shouldn't be hard to guess what famous story I brought to life in the form
  of a Shonen manga. It was none other than the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.
</p>
<p>
  I'm in a world where stories like Dragon Ball Z, Naruto, Bleach, One Peace,
  and several other famous works don't exist. But I chose to start with the tale
  of the four turtle brothers, not because it was easy, but because I wanted to
  establish my first initial loyal fan base.
</p>
<p>
  You see, there is very little mutant-type representation in media. Well,
  unless you count Godzilla, I mean, Godzillo. But he's Godzillo, and this meant
  that those with quirks that transformed their bodies beyond their control had
  very few stories that showed them off in a heroic light. Whenever they did
  show up, they were often shown off as the enemy or major villains.
</p>
<p>
  But imagine their shock when a new story of four mutant brothers fighting for
  Justice as heroes came out of nowhere to rock the manga world. It was no
  surprise that my manga was an overnight success with around 40% of the
  population!
</p>
<p>
  People couldn't get enough of my story, and the sheer internet buzz was
  explosive. There were theories, fan art, and even some fan fiction as well.
  The sheer number of sales from my first volume caused my bank account to swell
  up.
</p>
<p>
  Add up the great numbers The Hunger Games is making in sales worldwide, and
  things are looking very promising for my future. Still, THG did have a rocky
  start that had me and my publisher sweating for a while.
</p>
<p>
  The book didn't sell so well at first, but once I released my TMNT manga a
  week after the book's release, my fans couldn't help themselves but buy the
  book as well due to wanting to see what other stories Gege-sensei could tell.
  Thus boosting the book sales numbers! The book had gotten so popular that it
  even made it on the New York Times best-seller list.
</p>
<p>
  Slowly but surely, I was building myself up as quite the prospective new
  author.
</p>
<p>
  I couldn't wait until I released Harry Potter and Star Wars in a few months;
  this world wasn't ready for two of the greatest works of fiction to hit them.
</p>
<p>"Ew, look at him. He has that creepy smile again."</p>
<p>"He's not gonna laugh like that other time again, is he?"</p>
<p>"So creepy."</p>
<p>
  Any happiness I felt immediately left me as two whispering girls looked at me
  with disgust from where they sat. I frowned and flipped them off, causing them
  to blush in indignation. They gave me a glare and turned away with a huff.
</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>

<p></p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I wolfed down the rest of my lunch and placed my bento box away. I leaned back
  in my chair and stared at the ceiling with boredom.
</p>
<p>"Man, I hate school."</p>
<p>x x x</p>
<p>"Fuck! Nah, man, stop spamming!"</p>
<p>"Get good, you pleb!"</p>
<p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
<p>
  I glared at the mask-wearing Jin, or Twice, as I mashed the square button on
  my controller. No matter how many complex or diverse combos I had Ryu do, Jin
  was somehow able to get his character, Akuma, to dodge and avoid all my
  attacks.
</p>
<p>
  "Haha! You were but a fool to think you could challenge me! He just needs some
  training! He'll get it!" Twice said as he changed personalities mid-fight, all
  the while knocking my health back with ease.
</p>
<p>"Shut it, you Deadpool wannabe! I'll kick your ass today!"</p>
<p>
  The two of us were currently sitting on a couch in Jin's much cleaner and
  organized apartment. A pair of the controllers sat in our hands as we played
  the latest iteration of Street Fighter on my futuristic PlayStation 16.
</p>
<p>
  This was a reoccurring activity the two of us did twice a week when we had
  some time off. Me from school, work, jujutsu stuff,f and Jin from his crime
  shenanigans, which mostly involved him working as a henchman for a local gang.
  But don't worry, he's not a bad guy. He's just trying to make ends meet.
</p>
<p>
  Sometimes, we watched some movies or even walked around the city to mess with
  innocent civilians by playing harmless pranks on them. Like the time we put a
  fake spider in a guy's coffee, and he screamed like a little girl. Or when we
  pretended to be lost tourists and asked for directions to a place that didn't
  exist. We even grabbed some street food here and there and discussed the
  meaning of life when we saw a squirrel dry humming another squirrel.
</p>
<p>
  It was a refreshing and pleasant experience for me to have a friend I could be
  myself with, thanks to his older age, considering I was in my early twenties
  when I died. So, having a brothat I could make crude jokes with was great.
</p>
<p>
  It took a while for Jin to be comfortable enough with me in order for him to
  wear his mask in my presence, but when I proved to him that his different
  personalities didn't change my opinion of him. He became more open and
  relaxed. So whenever the two of us hung out at his place, he wore his mask
  almost all the time.
</p>
<p>And let me tell you, talking to Twice was funny as shit.</p>
<p>
  "Eat shit, scrub! Good game, my friend!" Twice held out a hand for me to shake
  while his other hand made crybaby motions. I rolled my eyes and slapped his
  hand away, causing him to hold it against his chest with a pained expression.
  "Violence is never the answer. No, it's the solution!"
</p>
<p>"Amen to that."</p>
<p>"Don't agree with him! Yes, agree to my ways!"</p>
<p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
<p>x x x</p>
<p>"Gahh, it's a villain!"</p>
<p>"Watch out!"</p>
<p>
  I landed on my perch on the edge of the rooftop and looked down below at the
  chaotic street to find a large man covered in jagged rocks. Despite this being
  a relatively busy street, this guy decided it was a good idea to start raining
  punches into the street, causing everyone close by to panic and run away in
  fear.
</p>

<p>Who knew things in Naruhata were as hectic as they said?</p>
<p>
  "Well, this is weird," I muttered as I watched the seemingly out-of-control
  man destroy the sidewalk, causing a cloud of dust to rise all around him.
  "What's up with this guy? He trip or something?" I then looked down the road
  to see someone dressed in a... All Might hoodie with motorcycle protective
  gear?
</p>
<p>"What is this? Clown hour?"</p>
<p>
  "I'm the man who charges into danger! The Crawler!" The weirdo, I mean the
  Crawler, said as he slid along the ground on all four limbs. His head perked
  up at the sight of the rampaging nut case, and he quickly came to a stop.
  "Wait... really? Isn't this guy..."
</p>
<p>
  Landing on a traffic light several feet behind the Crawler was a girl maybe
  three or four years older than me dressed in a skin-tight black outfit with
  small bat wings on the small side of her back. She had pink hair pulled up in
  twin tails as a black painted-on mask sat over her eyes.
</p>
<p><i>Huh, another one? Are these two new heroes or something?</i></p>
<p>
  I looked down at the crow beside me and squinted at him. "Oi, Crow Nanami.
  Didn't I tell you to look for crooks in isolated locations? This is too
  public."
</p>
<p>
  (Hm, I originally found the large rock human a few blocks away in an isolated
  area. It seems he decided to move here for some reason.) Crow Nanami said as
  he tilted the small round sunglasses over his small eyes.
</p>
<p>
  I nodded at his answer and didn't ask where he acquired those sunglasses for
  the sake of maintaining my fleeting sanity.
</p>
<p>"I see..."</p>
<p>"Gagagaga! Y-you! You again! The C-Crawl... The Crawler!"</p>
<p>
  I turned my attention back down towards the crazed rock-enhanced man and the
  Crawler. It seemed that these two scrubs knew each other somehow. A fact that
  the Crawler took great pleasure in as he slid in and out of the larger man's
  attacks.
</p>
<p>"Hear that? He called me Crawler! Not Cruller!"</p>
<p>
  "Stop looking so pleased! Most people wouldn't want villains remembering their
  names!" The pink-haired exhibitionist said to the Crawler.
</p>
<p>
  The Crawler decided to take things a little more seriously as he began to
  carefully lead the rock man away from the populated area they were in and
  towards a more solitary location. The girl in the tight black suit pulled out
  a phone and stayed where she was while her apparent partner slid away.
</p>
<p><i>Not a combat type, then.</i></p>
<p>
  "Crow Nanami," I said as I stood up from my spot and adjusted my black hood. I
  was wearing my sorcerer outfit, which was comprised of a thick black jacket, a
  long-sleeved white shirt, and a high collar underneath. I also wore black
  jeans and sneakers while my katana hung from my left belt hoop. Finally,
  Slaughter Demon was resting inside a shieth strapped to my back.
</p>
<p>
  "Any news on that assignment I gave you and the others?" I jumped from rooftop
  to rooftop while keeping an eye on the Crawler and the so-called villain. Crow
  Nanami flew behind me and shook his head.
</p>
<p>
  (I'm afraid we still have yet to find any humans with those bird-like masks.
  I'll be sure to expand my search, even if it means I'll have to work
  overtime.) Crow Nanami said with a sigh.
</p>
<p>
  "Good, keep at it. I'll handle things from here. I want to see what these
  <i>heroes </i>can do." Crow Nanami nodded and flew off into the night.
</p>
<p>
  Seeing the Crawler and the Rock Man come to a stop at a parking lot, I jumped
  down between two buildings and slid down one of the brick walls while claws
  made of my blood sank into the brick to slow my descent until I came to a full
  stop on the wall. With my blood claws as anchors, I was able to stay stuck on
  the wall under the cover of darkness.
</p>
<p><i>Suck on that, Spider-Man!</i></p>

<p></p>
<p>Blood Manipulation was such a diverse and great technique!</p>
<p>
  I watched the ongoing fight with disappointment as the Crawler just continued
  sliding around to avoid the Rock Man's attacks. All the while, the pink-haired
  girl with some sort of jumping quirk watched while telling the watching public
  to call the police.
</p>
<p>
  "Definitely not heroes. These two are probably Vigilantes." I muttered as The
  Crawler continued to not put up a fight. "Keep doing that, and you'll trip on
  all the holes you two made."
</p>
<p>
  I didn't have to wait long before The Crawler's back foot fell into one of the
  craters the large Rock Man made with his attacks, causing the Crawler to trip.
  Seeing his opportunity, Rock Man pulled his arm back to finally crush the
  Crawler.
</p>
<p>
  "Koichi!" The pink-haired girl shouted in worry just as The Crawler was about
  to be struck down.
</p>

  "Koichi. Did she really shout his real name out loud?" I debated on whether to
  help these two clowns, but a fast-moving shadow moved towards the parking lot
  caused me to pause.
</p>
<p>
  A loud metallic clang rippled through the air as a long-haired ninja with a
  triangle-like mask stopped Rock Man's punch using only his katana. Showing off
  an impressive amount of skill and strength. Rock Man took a step back, his
  face twisted in confusion, almost as if he couldn't believe his strike was
  blocked by a meager sword.
</p>
<p>
  Not wasting a second, Mask Guy swung his katana at Rock Man's raised defense
  with aggressive slashes. Littering the larger man's rock-covered body in
  slices and cuts.
</p>
<p>
  "Hoh, not bad." I grabbed the grip of my own katana and watched the ongoing
  fight with interest and some excitement. "He's pretty good."
</p>
<p>
  "It's the cops!" The pink-haired girl cried out as the sounds of police sirens
  neared their location.
</p>
<p>
  Hearing this, the once-rampaging Rock Man hightailed it out of the parking lot
  and away from the area. It didn't seem like The Crawler or Mask-Man were going
  after him. Instead, the three decided it was more important to chat.
</p>
<p>
  "Um... thanks for the save. Who are you, exactly?" Koichi asked as he and his
  partner looked at Mask-Man.
</p>
<p>
  "The name's Stendhal. Another meddler, just like you." Stendhal said as he
  sheathed his katana. Once Stendhal was done posing and looking cool, he then
  jumped away using an impressive amount of speed and jumping ability.
</p>
<p>
  I leaped up onto the rooftops and began following after Stendhal with an
  excited grin on my face as the tell-tell signs of Flowing Red Scale covered my
  eyes.
</p>
<p>I knew from the moment Stendhal showed up that he wasn't a hero.</p>
<p>No, the guy was practically radiating negative energy.</p>
<p>"Now then, where do you think you're going?"</p>
