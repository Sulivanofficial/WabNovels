        <h2>Chapter 11: NO. 11 - The Sparks of Black</h2>
        <p><i>Clang!</i></p>
        <p>
          "That wasn't very nice. You could have poked an eye out with that." I
          said as I slid my katana back into its sheath after deflecting a
          speeding knife.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing behind me was Rock Man, his face covered in sweat, and a
          worried and pained expression settled over his face. That expression
          quickly changed to surprise when he noticed my sudden appearance in
          the extended back alley path he was running through. He stood stock
          still as his gaze shifted from me to his pursuer, Stendhal, who was
          now staring daggers at me from the other end of the alley.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "You dare get in the way of true judgment?" Stendhal said as he
          reached over to his katana. He unsheathed his dangerously sharp weapon
          and pointed it toward me in one swift move. "You must be this
          villain's partner. Very well then, I'll be sure to take you both
          down."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Villian? Listen here, Tuxedo Mask." I pointed a finger over at Rock
          Man. "I don't really care about or know who this guy is."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Then why get in my way?" Stendhal hissed, his patience running low. I
          rolled my eyes under the darkness of my hood and then moved my hand to
          point at him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because of you. You see, there's this thing I'm trying to get. And so
          far, all the clowns I've fought couldn't give me the push I need to
          get it. You, on the other hand, have some pretty impressive moves." I
          drew out my katana and held it in both hands beside my head. "So what
          I want from you is a good fight."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "...enough of this charade. I'll cut you down and then move onto the
          one behind you!" Stendhal growled out and rushed at me with incredible
          speed; his katana pulled back and ready to slice me in two.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >This is my chance. I have to limit myself to only my pure strength,
            speed, skills, and CE. No curse techniques. I have to push myself to
            land a Black Flash.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I dashed forward as well, ready to meet my opponent head-on. The clash
          of metal echoed through the alley as Stendhal and I engaged in an
          intense sword fight. Our katanas clashed and sparked as we moved with
          incredible speed and precision. Each strike was met with a swift parry
          or a skillful dodge, creating a mesmerizing dance of blades.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >This guy's good! If it weren't for both Yuta's swordsmanship skills
            and Maki's weapons specialist skills, I doubt I'd last this long!</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          At some point during our fight, Rock Man had decided it was time to
          get the hell out of dodge and made a break for it, leaving me and
          Stendhal alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stendhal's formidable skills pushed me to the limit, but I matched his
          every move with determination and focus. Our intense exchange of blows
          continued; however, Stendhal was slowly gaining ground on me. His
          bigger size and strength were giving him the edge. It was only thanks
          to my CE and my natural strength that I was even able to put up a
          fight.
        </p>

        <p>
          "You're skilled. I'll give you that." Stendhal said as he deflected my
          horizontal strike. "But I'm stronger."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+25 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><i>Crapbaskets! </i></p>
        <p>
          In a move that took me by surprise, Stendhal closed the distance
          between us and kicked my stomach with his foot. I grunted as I slid
          back on the ground, only to look up at the descending blade of his
          katana over my head. Moving on instinct, I raised my weapon above my
          head and deflected his attack away, causing him to lose balance
          momentarily.
        </p>
        <p><i>Now's my chance!</i></p>
        <p>
          I let my katana fall onto the ground as I prepped my CE into my right
          fist. Stendhal looked down at me and jumped back just as I was about
          to lad a CE-enhanced punch at his stomach.
        </p>
        <p><i>Shit! </i></p>
        <p>
          As he moved away, he threw two knives at me with precision and speed.
          I raised my right arm and used it to block the knives from stabbing
          into my torso. With a wince, I ripped them out and threw the knives at
          the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How foolish. You've abandoned your weapon in hopes of hitting me with
          your fist. Perhaps you're not as skilled as I originally thought."
          Stendhal said as he leaned forward. "Now then, it's time for evil to
          be cut down!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+15 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Stendhal, with his razor-sharp katana, moved right at me with
          incredible speed, aiming to strike me down while I was unarmed.
        </p>
        <p>
          I glared at him as I narrowly dodged and weaved away from his nonstop
          lethal strikes with calculated and graceful movements. It was taking
          everything I had to not get sliced or skewered with every attack
          Stendhal executed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite my efforts, Stendhal's formidable skills were quickly pushing
          me to my limits. I was growing tired, and my speed was beginning to
          drop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Stendhal noticed this and capitalized on my drop of speed. He slid his
          left foot out and stepped on my foot, causing me to trip up. Swiping
          his sword diagonally, Stendhal finally managed to land a cut on my
          body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing my blood, Stendhal smirked under his mask and spun on his hips
          to cut off my head. His foot was still pressing down on my own,
          keeping me in place with his greater strength.
        </p>
        <p><i>Shit! Dodge! Dodge- There's no time or space to dodge!</i></p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          Time seemed to slow to a crawl as I watched Stendhal's razor-sharp
          sword grow closer and closer to my neck. I tightened my hands into
          fists as I glared at the man in front of me and charged CE into my
          fists.
        </p>
        <p><i>I'm not going to lose to you! I refuse to lose!</i></p>
        <p>It was at that moment that I finally felt it.</p>
        <p>"Black..."</p>
        <p>
          Just as Stendhal's blade was a millimeter away from my neck, I landed
          a punch straight into Stendhal's face while applying my cursed energy
          within 0.000001 seconds. Causing a distortion in space around both
          Stendhal and me as arcs of red and black sparked to life.
        </p>
        <p><strong>"Flash!"</strong></p>
        <p>
          Stendhal's mask shattered on impact as his body flew back several feet
          in a violent spin. I winced as a long, shallow, bleeding cut now
          adorned the side of my neck. Despite the pain, I felt my mind grow
          clearer than ever before.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "I understand now," I muttered as I looked down at my hands. I
          clenched them tightly and looked over at Stendhal; an aura of CE
          quickly grew around my body. "It's just like Todo said; all this time,
          I've just been using CE without truly understanding it, like a novice
          chef using ingredients without any purpose. But now, it's so clear to
          me."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Stand up, Stendhal. Let me show you what 120% of my potential truly
          looks like." I said as Stendhal finally managed to stand to his feet;
          his face was profusely bleeding, and his nose was broken.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+50 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "...your conviction is unshakable," Stendhal muttered as he held his
          bloody face with his hand. He was swaying where he stood as his knees
          shook. He then raised his hand to show off a bloodied knife. "But this
          fight ends here."
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched in confusion as he raised the knife to his mouth. In an
          instant, my eyes grew wide in realization. "No way, are you-" A long
          tongue slipped out his mouth and gave the bloody knife a long lick.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Geh!" I felt all control of my body leave me as I collapsed on the
          floor in a heap, causing my hood to fall off my head. I tried to move,
          but the most my body would do was tremble in exertion. Despite that, I
          spun my head to glare over the man who would one day be <i>Stain</i>.
          "Y-you bastard."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >What the hell?! What's Stain doing here dressed like that?! Did I
            miss his backstory or something?!</i
          >
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          Stendhal fell to one knee as he looked over at me with a shocked
          expression before it turned into a wide, bloodthirsty smile. "You have
          potential, child. That is why I will not extinguish your light today.
          Our fight has taught me many things... I'm sure we will meet in the
          future to finish today's battle. Farewell."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I watched helplessly as Stendhal turned around and walked away slowly
          with a wobble until he disappeared into the darkness. I continued to
          try and move my body but found the task to be impossible.
        </p>
        <p><i>Flowing Red Scale!</i></p>
        <p>
          With my technique active, I slowly pulled my hood over my head and
          began to push my body up. As I moved, it felt like each of my limbs
          was strapped to 226 Kilogram weights, making the normally easy task of
          standing a herculean task.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Damn... now I have to wait for his quirks effect to wear off. Just
          great."

        <p>"I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not."</p>
        <p>
          I watched as the small plastic prize ball in my hand slowly shimmered
          away once I received my reward. In an instant, the slight pain on my
          still-healing neck had become a lot more bearable. With enough focus,
          I pushed the pain to the back of my mind as if I wasn't even hurt at
          all. Even so, the injury still stung.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was sitting in my small room, loose papers and art supplies strewn
          around, as two laptops sat on my desk. Unlike usual, there were no
          clones slaving away today. The reason was the large stack of
          manuscripts and a year's worth of weekly Chapters sitting in several
          folders on a cluttered desk.
        </p>
        <p>Safe to say, I was extremely ahead of schedule.</p>
        <p>
          I was even in the negotiating process of selling the first entries to
          both Harry Potter and Star Wars. It wouldn't be long before my name
          blew up in this world, well, at least my pen name.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Use 700 SP." I said as I twisted the gacha's dial. After a few
          seconds, a new prize ball popped out of the machine.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hated to admit it, but I was now thoroughly addicted to gambling
          away my points. Hopefully, my new addition stayed to this gacha
          machine and not to the blood-sucking casinos this world has to offer.
        </p>
        <p>
          It killed me at times not to go all in, but I knew I had to be careful
          with my points. Otherwise, I'd keep hoarding more useless junk from
          the JJK world. It got to the point that I had to rent an entire
          storage unit to store all my useless junk.
        </p>

        <p>
          I already had ten pairs of Gojo's sunglasses. I didn't need more. Even
          if they were from a designer brand.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>[You have pulled: The Inventory Curse! Rank: Silver.]</strong>
        </p>
        <p>"Say wha?"</p>
        <p>
          I watched with curiosity as cursed energy began to gather in the space
          in front of me from seemingly nowhere. After a few seconds, a purple
          wormlike creature appeared in the air. Before it could fall on the
          ground, I caught it in my arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh, so I can win cursed spirits as well? Neat. Does that mean I can
          pull Rika as well?" I said as the wormlike curse spirit looked at me
          with a derpy expression. "Now then, are you loyal to me or what?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The curse spirit nodded as if it fully understood me. I grinned and
          lifted it close to my body so it could wrap itself around my torso
          like it did with Toji.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Awesome. I'm going to call you... Zaiko. Yup!" I patted Zaiko's head
          with a smile, causing the spirit to hum. "Zaiko it is!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked over and reached under my bed to grab my only two weapons:
          Kusakabe's katana and Slaughter Demon. I lifted them towards Zaiko's
          mouth and watched in fascination as he swallowed them both easily.
          Causing them both to vanish seemingly. I then reached into its mouth
          and pulled out Slaughter Demon.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now I can always walk around with my weapons. How convenient. You
          wouldn't happen to have Toji's arsenal, now, would you?" I asked
          Zaiko. The spirit looked confused and shook its head. "You don't know
          who Toji is? Hmm, I wonder if this gacha system clears your memories
          when it brought you here. This only begs the question of whether you
          were Toji or Geto's spirit that I snatched or if you're an exact copy
          made by the system itself."
        </p>
        <p>
          Before I could think any deeper into the possible mechanics of my
          gacha system, the alarm on my phone went off. I reached over to my
          desk and hit the snooze button on my phone. Today was the day I would
          finally meet my editor for my TMNT manga.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had been pestering and repeatedly asking for an in-person meeting
          after the sudden rise of my story's popularity. Apparently,
          communication over email and texts wasn't good enough for her.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without wasting any time, I quickly used my remaining five pulls.
          Sadly, I didn't win any more decent rewardsâjust a bunch of more
          useless junk like Miwa's black tie and Miguel's funny hat.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Let's get a move on, Zaiko," I said, walking out of my room to begin
          walking through the orphanage's hallways. I reached into my jacket
          pocket and pulled out a pair of round sunglasses to place over my
          eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Hopefully, this won't take too long."</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>

        <p>
          The aroma of freshly ground coffee beans filled the air as Mikami
          Asuka, a red-haired woman with blue eyes dressed in a yellow cardigan
          jacket and black khaki pants, sat at a cozy corner table in the
          bustling cafe.
        </p>
        <p>
          She watched as the barista expertly steamed milk for her latte,
          creating a mesmerizing swirl in the cup. The gentle chatter of other
          patrons provided a soothing background noise, and the warm glow of the
          afternoon sun streamed through the large windows, casting a golden hue
          over the entire space.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asuka took a moment to savor the tranquility of the cafe, which was a
          welcome break from her usual hectic days. She took a sip of her latte.
          The rich, velvety flavor danced on her taste buds, bringing a
          contented smile to her face.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asuka had been working in the manga industry for the past two years
          now, so her experience in the field was somewhat lacking. Despite
          that, she was hungry and desperate to secure her spot at the top of
          the industry. This meant she had to find the next big story to shake
          the manga world.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was easier said than done. Even after one year of searching and
          interviewing several hopeful future Mangakas', Asuka came up
          empty-handed. All of the stories and one-shots she's seen were generic
          and boring. There was nothing new and fresh. Nothing that would catch
          the reader's attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was until she received an email from someone by the name of Gege.
        </p>
        <p>
          This wasn't unusual by any means. Asuka's email was constantly
          receiving messages from wannabe artists who wanted her to take a
          chance on them and their works. But the message she received from Gege
          was different. His message was short and to the point.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Read this and let me know when we can start."</i></p>
        <p>
          Gege's message was one of extreme confidence. Some wouldn't be remiss
          even to say a bit egotistical. But when Asuka took a look at the
          attached files, she couldn't help but be unimpressed with the art
          quality. The drawings were decent, but nothing impressive.
        </p>
        <p>But they didn't have to be.</p>
        <p>No, what stood out like a star in the sky was the story.</p>
        <p>
          The tale of four mutant ninja brothers who fight against evil and
          protect the innocent from the shadows as unsung heroes was
          attention-grabbing.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was also the very story she's been in search of this entire time.
          Asuka wasn't like most people. Most people wanted to see
          larger-than-life heroes performing grand heroic feats while looking
          handsome, beautiful, and
          <i>human-like</i>
        </p>

        .
        <p></p>
        <p>
          It wasn't a giant secret that the media didn't like to show off those
          with mutant-type quirks. No, heroes like Gang Orca, Wolf-Man, Super
          Snake Woman, and many more pro-mutant heroes weren't exactly pushed to
          be on the front pages or main time slots on television or movies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Even in today's day and age, people still can't differentiate between
          those who look different and monsters or villains.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, a story like the one of the turtle brothers could be the push
          to help society change. Even if it's a small push. So Asuka instantly
          agreed to take on Gege and submit his story to Jump. The bigwigs in
          charge almost didn't accept running the story, but Asuka wasn't one to
          give up so easily. She pushed and pushed the bigwigs until they agreed
          to give the story a shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          And to everyone's surprise, except her, Gege's story was an instant
          success. The readers couldn't get enough of the tales of the four
          ninja turtle brothers and their rat father. Week after week, each
          edition of Jump had massive salesâa large part due to Gege's story.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can also imagine her shock when she found out that Gege was also a
          writer as well. He has written the recently awarded New York Times
          bestseller The Hunger Games.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asuka had asked to meet Gege on several occasions, but the Mangaka was
          adamant about maintaining their communication over the internet or by
          phone. But after working alongside him for several weeks, Asuka
          wouldn't take no for an answer anymore.
        </p>
        <p><i>"Fine, we can meet at this cafe in Musutafu then."</i></p>
        <p>
          That's how Asuka ended up in a lovely cafe in the city of Musutafu.
          Her face was eager and impatient to meet the man who did so much in so
          little time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Glancing around, Asuka noticed a group of young teenagers engaged in
          lively conversation at a nearby table, their laughter adding a
          cheerful energy to the atmosphere. The aroma of freshly baked pastries
          wafted from the display case, tempting her with their decadent
          sweetness.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's almost time. Where is he?" Asuka asked as she took another sip
          of her drink.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lost in her thoughts, Asuka failed to notice a young black-haired boy
          dressed in a black hoodie and white shirt as he looked down at his
          phone and then at her repeatedly. With a shrug, he walked over and sat
          in the chair opposite of her nonchalantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Noticing the weird kid sitting in front of her, Asuka raised an
          annoyed eyebrow at him. "Hey, kid, you lost or something? Listen, I
          don't have time for you. Can you go bother someone else?"
        </p>
        <p>"Kid? Lady, I'm twelve."</p>
        <p>
          "So, a kid," Asuka said with a sigh. She then made shoo-shoo motions
          at her uninvited guest with an eye roll. "Do you want some money or
          something? Here's five hundred yen; now go away."
        </p>
        <p>
          The youth wearing sunglasses took the bill with a shrug and slid it
          into his pocket. Still, he didn't move and stared at Asuka with a
          slight grin. The red-haired woman slowly began to feel an odd feeling
          from the kid in front of her. Almost negative.
        </p>
        <p>
          This caused Asuka to slowly slide back into the back of her chair. Her
          reaction caused the black-haired boy's grin to stretch wider in
          amusement.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah... I-I have to go now." Asuka muttered as she began to gather her
          stuff to leave the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Really?" The young boy said in an amused tone. "I thought you wanted
          to meet me, Mikami-san." In an instant, Asuka froze and turned to him
          with slowly widening eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"Gege... s-sensei?"</p>
        <p>"In the flesh."</p>
        <p>
          A few moments later, a long, hushed, high-pitched whine filled the
          cafe.
        </p>

        <h2>Chapter 13: NO. 13 - A Bitter Pill</h2>
        <p>The city of Musutafu was a special city.</p>
        <p>
          It was your run-of-the-mill city located in the Shizuoka prefecture.
          Around a 2 hour train ride from the orphanage I live at.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there were several key locations ripe with potential points
          waiting to be made within Musutafu.
        </p>
        <p>
          Locations like Midoriya's Apartment, Takoba Municipal Beach Park,
          Tatooin Station, the Todoroki household, Aldera Junior High, and
          finally, U.A. High School.
        </p>
        <p>But I wasn't here for any of those locations today.</p>
        <p>
          No, I was here to visit my old fellow orphan and friend. Hase Keiko.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This must be it." I looked up from the GPS on my phone at the
          impressive-looking two-story home. A bag of fancy cookies in my right
          hand. "Hm, not bad."
        </p>
        <p>
          Zaiko grunted from his spot on my shoulder as it also looked over the
          house.
        </p>
        <p>
          My amusing meeting with my editor, thankfully, only lasted two hours.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asuka was a rather fun person to mess with. Unsurprisingly, my young
          age had thrown her for a loop. While watching her stutter and
          apologize for being rude was funny, she recovered quickly, and we both
          got to business.
        </p>
        <p>
          She had tried to sneakily impose some story beats and suggestions for
          my story, as all manga editors try to do, but I quickly shut that shit
          down and told her what my plans for my story were. Asuka was surprised
          that I only had so many Chapters in mind for the duration of my story
          and that I didn't want it to run for years on end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Asuka immediately tried to dissuade me from this due to the sheer
          popularity of my story. However, when I mentioned that I had another
          story planned once TMNT was done, she quickly changed her tune and
          peppered me with questions.
        </p>
        <p>
          This version of Japan wasn't ready for Dragon Ball Z to drop. This
          one's for you, Toriyama. Your legend will live on in this uncultured
          world.
        </p>
        <p>"What do we got here."</p>
        <p>
          I stepped forward and read the nameplate by the house gate. Yoshiyuki,
          it read. I reached out and pressed the doorbell on the house's stone
          gate pillar and waited. As I waited, I looked over to the house next
          door, where a black crow was perched on its roof. I nodded at Crow
          Megumi, causing him to nod back.
        </p>
        <p>
          From my calls over the years with Keiko, she had told me that her new
          family was apparently super wonderful and friendly. They had been very
          supportive and loving of her. I was happy for her. I truly was. She
          was a sweet girl who had gone through hell very early on. She deserves
          some happiness.
        </p>
        <p>
          It wasn't until recently that she insisted I come and meet her family.
          Something I had been pushing off for as long as I could.
        </p>
        <p>Not because I didn't want to.</p>
        <p>Of course not.</p>
        <p>
          No, it was due to how busy I've been lately and my nightly escapades.
          But Keiko had finally had enough and all but ordered me to come today.
        </p>
        <p>Stubborn woman, er, child.</p>
        <p>"Sou-chan!"</p>
        <p>
          Keiko ran out of her front door and swung open the front gate of her
          house to jump into my arms. She had a large smile on her face as she
          tried to squeeze the life out of my body.
        </p>
        <p>"You're here! You're finally here! You've gotten taller!"</p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>

        <p>
          "Calm down, Keiko," I said with a small smile, causing her to laugh.
          "You'll crush my gift."
        </p>
        <p>
          The excitable blue-haired girl jumped back and looked down at the blue
          bag in my hand. She then grabbed my other hand and dragged me towards
          her home.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I can't wait for you to meet my mother and father! I'm sure you'll
          love them! They're so nice, and they even let me decorate my own room
          however I like. Oh! Oh! I want to show you my room!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Easy there, girl," I said as I patted the top of her head in an
          attempt to calm down her high levels of energy, just as I did during
          our time at the orphanage. "Let me meet your new folks first."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, heh-heh. Sorry! I'm just... so happy to see you again." Keiko
          softly said as we stopped by the front door. Her yellow eyes gazed at
          me with fondness. "I missed you."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "..." I kept still and stared at her in stumped silence. A soft, warm
          feeling grew around my chest. What I felt wasn't romantic. No, this
          feeling was something else. It was hard to describe... it was nice.
          "I, uh, I miss-"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Keiko-chan! Is this the young man you've been talking about nonstop?"
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyebrow twitched in annoyance, and I turned to look at a
          middle-aged couple standing by the door.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man had well-combed brown hair with a light build; he was dressed
          in casual clothing well suited to being at home. The woman beside him
          had black hair pulled into a low ponytail. She wore a pink blouse and
          a long yellow skirt hung down her legs.
        </p>
        <p>
          The couple looked away from their daughter and flinched when their
          eyes met my own. It seemed that they were able to quickly pick up the
          negative energy I was producing. Usually, it took most people a few
          minutes of being around me to notice.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You must be, Souta. It's a pleasure to finally meet you, young man.
          Keiko here has had nothing but wonderful things to say about you."
          Keiko's new mother said with a smile, seemingly getting over any of
          the feelings she felt about me. "My name is Yoshiyuki Hana. And this
          here is my husband, Yoshiyuki Kenta."
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's a pleasure to meet you both," I said with a slight bow of my
          head. It wouldn't do me any good to be disrespectful to my friend's
          parents.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"Wow, I've never seen you bow to anyone, Sou-chan. How rare."</p>
        <p>"I can be respectful. I just choose not to."</p>
        <p>"You've grown up so much, Sou-chan. I'm so proud."</p>
        <p>"You do know I'm older than you, right?"</p>
        <p>
          The Yoshiyuki couple chuckled at our conversations. I, on the other
          hand, was taken aback. It seems that Keiko has grown rather bold ever
          since she left. I missed the little girl who hid behind me whenever we
          had people over. Her newfound confidence was both surprising and
          amusing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then, why don't you two kids come on in? We wouldn't want the
          snacks Keiko worked so hard to prepare to go to waste, now do we?"
        </p>
        <p>"M-mother! Don't tell Sou-chan that!"</p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>

        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>
          Keiko's room was a cheerful and cozy space. It perfectly reflected her
          vibrant and bubbly personality.
        </p>
        <p>
          After talking and getting to know Keiko's parents for around forty
          minutes, I came to the conclusion that the Yoshiyuki couple were good
          people. Unlike most people I come across, they barely had any traces
          of negative emotions. Something I was able to pick up pretty easily,
          thanks to my abilities as a sorcerer. The two of them truly loved and
          cared for my friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          A fact that put me at ease, still, I would continue having Crow Megumi
          watch over her. Just to be safe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the Yoshiyuki couple were satisfied after asking me a multitude
          of questions about myself, they let Keiko and I go up to her room per
          her request.
        </p>
        <p>
          The walls were painted in a soft shade of sky blue and adorned with
          colorful posters of her favorite anime characters and bands. A large
          bookshelf stood against one wall, filled with several children's books
          and trinkets. A comfortable bed with a bright floral bedspread sat in
          one corner, accompanied by a plush All Might toy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The room was illuminated by fairy lights strung across the ceiling,
          casting a warm and inviting glow. A small desk, littered with art
          supplies and sketches, occupied another corner. Sitting on a chair was
          the All Might-themed sweater she had received all those years ago.
          Overall, the room exuded a sense of joy and individuality, perfectly
          capturing who Keiko was.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You sure went wild with decorating your room," I said as I walked
          over to her desk, where several sketches sat.
        </p>
        <p>
          They were rough drawings of female hero costumes. Each one of them had
          detailed notes of what each article of the costume did or what it was
          made of. Seeing them caused my amused smile to melt away. With my back
          turned to her, Keiko nodded happily and threw herself on her bed.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Yeah! Isn't it wonderful! I have it all to myself, and I don't have
          to share it." Keiko froze in her excited chattering and turned to me
          with a sad, regrettable expression. "I'm sorry, Sou-chan. I didn't-"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "It's fine." I interrupted her as I sat down on her bed to lay beside
          her. "I don't need any parents anyway. I'm incredibly self-sufficient,
          didn't you know."
        </p>
        <p>
          "I know. But still... I feel like I'm bragging when I show off my room
          and my parents. Ow! Why did you hit me with my own pillow!?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Because you're being stupid," I said as I turned to her with a grin.
          "I'm happy you're happy. So don't worry about little old me. I'm doing
          just fine."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Keiko remained silent and brushed her fingers on the bandage on my
          neck. "Then what's this? Are you still getting into fights?"
        </p>
        <p>"...no?"</p>
        <p>
          I sat up and looked over at her desk, where all her hero costume
          sketches sat. "I see you still want to be a hero." I said in order to
          change the subject, Keiko quickly sat up and covered my eyes with her
          hands. "I thought I told you that was a bad idea."
        </p>
        <p>
          "No, don't look! I-I'm still working on them!" Keiko said with an
          embarrassed blush as I chuckled. "And, of course, I still want to be a
          hero! After all, I want to be just like All Might. I want to save
          people from danger with a smile like he did when he saved me!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I grabbed her hands and removed them from my face with a sigh.
          Standing up, I walked over to her desk and placed a hand on her
          hoodie.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being a hero was something she always talked about when she still
          lived with me at the orphanage. Then again, that's pretty much what
          every kid talks about when they're young and full of dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, unlike most kids with weak and lame abilities, Keiko's quirk
          actually had some potential. Her quirk was called Loving Sheild.
        </p>

        <p>
          Loving Shield allowed her to summon barriers or walls of blue energy
          capable of stopping/blocking anything as strong as her. What powers
          her quirk is her abnormally high levels of positive emotions. However,
          if her happy emotional state gets disrupted or shaken, her energy
          barriers will grow weaker or break.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the moment, her quirk is rather weak due to her young age and
          inexperience, but with enough time, I knew that her ability had the
          potential to grow to be rather powerful.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do you think... I can't do it?" Keiko asked shyly, her hands on her
          knees as she looked down at her pink carpet. Her usually bright and
          happy yellow eyes were now dimmer. I once again found myself sighing
          and brushed back my hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's not that. You know how I feel about heroes. It's a dangerous
          profession, Keiko."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "I know that! But I know I can do it!" Keiko said with a grin, her
          previous shyness gone as if it was never there. She then clapped her
          hands like a certain blonde alchemist and held her palms to me. I
          watched as a barrier of blue energy half her size burst to life in
          front of her. "See?! I've been working really hard on my quirk! Try
          and get through it like before."
        </p>
        <p><i>It's true. This is a lot bigger and solid than before. </i></p>
        <p>
          I reached out and placed a hand on the barrier. Touching it didn't
          hurt or burn me; the only thing I felt from touching it was a nice,
          cool feeling. Slowly, I began to push the barrier with my natural
          strength. The barrier didn't budge. I then tried again with my CE and
          saw the barrier begin to shake. Seeing that, I stopped pushing.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Not bad; the last time I did this, my hand was able to push through
          it as if it were made of jello."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Heh-heh!" Keiko smiled and released her barrier in favor of placing
          her hands on her hips. "See! I've gotten a lot stronger. I'll
          definitely be a great hero someday!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Images of destruction and mutant humanoid creatures popped into my
          mind. A light blue-haired man with the power to crumble anything he
          touched creped up behind Keiko and slowly began to reach out to her
          face, ready to decay her to dust.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >In a few years from now, Keiko will probably be in the same year as
            Midoriya when he joins UA. If she does make it in, will she be
            placed in 1-A? No, I doubt it. At most, she'll probably make it to a
            general education course like Shinso. As long as she stays away from
            class 1-A, then she won't be at the heart of everything.</i
          >
          <i>She'll be fine.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I wanted to tell her to quit. To give up her dream of being a hero. It
          would only get her killed. She wasn't part of the main cast, and that
          meant she didn't have any plot armor like the rest of class 1-A. Keiko
          could very well die as one of the background characters.
        </p>
        <p>But if I told her to give up now, would that be fair to her?</p>
        <p>
          Was I really going to risk our relationship based on my paranoid
          what-ifs?
        </p>
        <p>
          "...Yeah. You're right." I forced my face to smile at her as I wrapped
          the All Might-themed sweater around her shoulders. "You'll definitely
          become a great hero someday... I'm sure of it."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+20 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Keiko looked at me with wide, happy eyes before wrapping her arms
          around my shoulders as she laughed and jumped. I was glad that her
          face was pressed into my shoulder; it meant she didn't have to see the
          frown on my face.

        <h2>Chapter 14: NO. 14 - Meet The Protagonist</h2>
        <p><strong>AN:</strong></p>
        <p><strong>I have two quick announcements:</strong></p>
        <p>
          <strong
            >I've been looking back and rereading Chapter 8, and I've been
            mulling over my decision to have Souta experiment on the criminals
            he takes down to awaken cursed energy within them. At the time, I
            didn't notice how large of a leap his character made, from being
            against killing to going Orochimaru on people. My bad (lol). Thus, I
            have decided to remove that part of the story. So like how there's
            no war in Ba Sing Se, that part of the story never happened.</strong

        <p>
          <strong
            >The next announcement is that I added some artwork to the auxiliary
            Chapter to give you all a better idea of what Souta, along with
            Keiko, looks like. It's a bit spoilery, but eh, we'll get there.

        <p>
          As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow across
          the city of Musutafu, I found myself walking through its bustling
          streets to get my mind off my earlier talk with Keiko.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fading light painted the buildings around me in soft hues of pink
          and gold, creating a mesmerizing backdrop for the silhouettes of
          different shaped people going about their evening activities. As I
          walked, my mind was busy thinking back to the events of today as Zaiko
          gurgled on my shoulder.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >"You'll definitely become a great hero someday. I'm sure of it."
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The words I said to Keiko continued to replay in my head. I couldn't
          help but wonder if I made the right call to tell her that. But the
          large, bright smile she gave me dissuaded those negative thoughts of
          mine.
        </p>
        <p>"Fucking softie."</p>
        <p>
          After a while, I grew tired of the busy streets and changed course to
          stroll through a nearby residential area. I gazed up to see a canvas
          of pastel colors, with wisps of clouds catching the last rays of
          sunlight that made up the sky.
        </p>
        <p><i>Boom!</i></p>
        <p>
          I turned my head to the sound of a hushed bang that sounded like an
          explosion. Curios, I began heading in the direction of the sound. As I
          grew closer, I was able to hear the fading sounds of laughter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, I came upon a small neighborhood park and saw a green, bushy,
          haired figure looking down at a smoking notebook standing at the
          center of the park.
        </p>
        <p>
          My eyes grew wide as I watched an 11-year-old Midoriya Izuku pick up
          his charred notebook with a sad expression on his dirty, teary-eyed
          face.
        </p>
        <p><i>Holy crap. It's Sheep Boi! I mean Izuku!</i></p>
        <p>
          Izuku sighed and walked over to one of the swinging chairs on the
          swing set. With a sigh, the boy took a seat and slowly swung back and
          forth. He was so lost in his little world that he had yet to notice me
          at the park entrance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Seeing my opportunity to interact with the main character of this
          world, I walked over to the swing set and took a seat beside him.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You know," I suddenly said, catching Izuku off guard. "You shouldn't
          be playing with fire here."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "O-Oh! No! I wasn't playing with matches or anything like that." Izuku
          squeezed his ruined notebook nervously as he looked between me and it.
          "This was because... because..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Easy there, kid. I'm not gonna tell on ya," I chuckled and began
          swinging back and forth. Zaiko gurgled in glee as the wind stroked its
          face. "The name's Souta. Shimizu Souta."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Kid? But you don't look that much older than me?" Izuku muttered and
          then perked up, suddenly remembering his manners. "Ah! I'm Midoriya
          Izuku. It's nice to meet you, Shimizu-s-san."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Just Souta is fine, Midoriya." I swung lazily and smiled at the
          soon-to-be nervous wreck. "So, why did you ruin your notebook? You got
          some dirty stuff in there or something?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Izuku's face burned bright red as he quickly shook his head. "What?!
          No! Nothing like that! It's just my, uh, my hero notes..."
        </p>
        <p>"Hooh? Hero notes? You mind if I take a look?"</p>
        <p><strong>[+20 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Izuku pressed his lips together and seemed unsure of what to do. In
          the end, he nodded meekly and tentatively handed me his ruined
          notebook. I looked down and saw the notebook's title: Hero Analysis
          for the Future #5.
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled, seeing one of his famous notebooks in person, and began to
          flip through the pages. Despite the notebook's ruined cover, the pages
          within were still in pretty good condition. Pages and pages of
          detailed notes and drawings on heroes of old and new filled the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was pretty impressive. Especially considering he was still around
          11 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Wow. This is some pretty impressive stuff, Midoriya." I said as I
          looked up at his surprised face. "Really impressive. You got some
          analysis quirk or something?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Holy-So much! Is this the point potential that comes with
            interacting with the main cast?!</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, no... Nothing like that. I just really love heroes, so I pay a
          lot of attention to them. Heh-heh..." Izuku looked away from me with
          his hand on his neck, his body tense. "It's sorta like my... hobby?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>He thinks I'm going to make fun of him.</i> I looked away from him
          and flipped through a few more pages to eventually find a large
          section dedicated to All Might.
          <i
            >Dang, he hasn't even started middle school yet, and he's already
            like this.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>"That so? Then what's <i>your </i></p>

        quirk?" I said with an expectant look and watched as he froze. His green
        eyes shifted back and forth to look anywhere else but at me.
        <p></p>
        <p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "I'm uh... I'm quirkless." Izuku softly said in a small voice with his
          eyes tightly shut.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite my issues with the Midoriya Izuku from the original series,
          seeing him in person and acting in such a way left a bad taste in my
          mouth. I couldn't help but be reminded of my little brother from my
          past life. He and Izuku were pretty similar.
        </p>
        <p>
          Izuku jumped slightly when I placed my hand on his shoulder. "I see.
          Well, that makes two of us then." Izuku's eyes grew large at my
          revelation. "Because I'm quirkless as well."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "R-Really?!" Izuku shouted as he jumped to his feet. "I mean, It's
          just that I haven't met anyone else who was quirkiness! I didn't mean
          to be rude, Shimizu-san, I mean, Souta-san!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I chuckled at his reaction and waved his worries away. "It's fine,
          Izuku. I get it. At least now I know why you were acting like a scared
          kitten. People can be pretty mean to us just for not having powers." I
          then held out his notebook and stood up as well. "Is that why your
          notebook got burnt? Someone pick on you?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+20 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "No, Kacchan was just... he lost control of his quirk. That's all..."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hm. If you say so." I said with a tone that told him I didn't buy
          what he said, causing him to look away. "We may be quirkless, Izuku,
          but that doesn't mean we're <i>worthless</i>. You wanna know what I
          did when someone looked down on me just because I was born with an
          extra joint in my dumb toe?"
        </p>
        <p>Intrigued, Izuku turned back to me and looked at me expectantly.</p>
        <p>"I kicked his ass."</p>
        <p>"You what?!"</p>
        <p><strong>[+40 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><i>This kid's reactions are hilarious.</i></p>
        <p>
          "Oh, yeah." I flexed both of my arms and grinned at him. "He had this
          quirk that gave him the ability to make any one of his limbs super
          strong. He thought that made him better than me, so he thought it was
          a good idea to smack my lunch on the ground while his little friends
          laughed. Unfortunately for him, I stood on business and slammed him
          onto the ground. Sure, I got suspended for two weeks, but that
          shitstain never bothered me again."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "N-no way. You really managed to beat somebody with a quirk! I can't
          believe it." Izuku said with an amazed look as he furiously scribbled
          into his notebook. "You said his quirk let him increase the power
          behind any one limb, correct? Just how much power could..."
        </p>
        <p>
          <i>Well, one thing is for sure: Izuku is definitely a quirk nerd. </i>
        </p>

        <p></p>
        <p>
          I shook my head as Izuku muttered away theories and ideas based on my
          short description of Whatshisface's quirk. I rolled my eyes at him and
          grabbed his shoulder to stop his muttering.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You're missing the point here, Izuku," I said and took my hand back.
          "What I'm trying to tell you is that just because we're quirkless, it
          doesn't mean we should just let those with quirks walk over us. Kinda
          like this Kacchan asshole who burnt your book."
        </p>
        <p>"It's not like that! Kacchan is my friend! Really!"</p>
        <p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          <i>Hmm, this kid sure is delusional</i>.
          <i
            >No wonder he turned out the way he did if this is how he thinks
            now.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "Fine, fine. If you say so, Broccoli Boy." I then pointed over at his
          notebook and smiled. "Quirk Analysis for the Future. That means you
          wanna be a hero, right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "A hero..." Izuku whispered. His eyes were both hopeful and
          downtrodden. "I... Quirkless people can't be heroes... right?"
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >If this was a shonen anime, which it is, this is the moment I give
            Izuku the words he's been waiting to hear ever since that dickhead
            of a doctor told him he was quirkless. Hopefully, all those hours of
            watching Naruto will pay off now.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "Eraser Head, Sir Nighteye, Midnight, and several other heroes mainly
          use their hand-to-hand skills and hard-earned strength to be heroes.
          Sure, they have fancy quirks that help them do their jobs, but that's
          nothing some impressive support gear can't cover for." I said as I
          looked down at my feet and wracked my brain to find the right words to
          say to this sad little boy.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was never the best at giving speeches or talking. So, I hoped that I
          was making sense of his overthinking butt. "So why not? Why can't
          <i>you</i> be a hero?<i> </i>As long as you put in the work and train
          yourself to the bone, I don't see why not. Don't let those losers or
          anyone else put you down, man. I mean, look at this notebook of yours.
          It's some impressive stuff."

        <p><i>Ka-Ching! Maybe I'm not so bad at talk-no-justu after all?</i></p>

          "Do you really think so?" Izuku whispered, large tears swelling in his
          eyes. "Can I truly... be a hero, too?"
        </p>
        <p>
          Sorry, All Might. I'm stealing your line here. I need them points.

          I ignored Izuku's little sobs in favor of looking at the new system

          turned to Izuku.

        <p>"Hm, an excellent pull."</p>
        <p>"Indeed. A very useful passive."</p>
        <p>"Gentlemen, I believe it's time."</p>
        <p>
          I looked around at my four clones as we all sat on a random round
          table I found on someone's rooftop balcony. Zaiko sat on my shoulder
          as usual. A pair of Gojo's shades rested over its derpy eyes. We were
          all dressed in my jujutsu uniform as we looked at one another with
          varying expressions.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You mean the Platinum pull." Clone A said to Clone B as he
          intertwined his fingers and leaned forward on the table. "Hm, a
          high-risk, high-reward pull. It's a risky option."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hah! What are you? Pussy? I say we go all in!" Clone C slapped his
          hand on the table as he leaned back on his chair. "So what if we lose
          all our points on the off chance we don't pull a reward? What life
          without some risk?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "You sound ridiculous. We have a better chance at pulling for a Gold
          tier reward. At least with that, we have four chances to win
          something! Not just one!" Clone D shook his head as he crossed his
          arms. His, my? Expression was set in a look that said, "I can't
          believe we're having this conversation."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Boss! I say we go for it!" Clone B abruptly stood up and turned to me
          with a large smile. "I say we do it! This could be our chance to get
          one of the four techniques on our wishlist! Just think about it. We
          have a 50% chance of pulling the Limitless, The Ten Shadows, Shrine,
          or Star Rage! Let's become OP!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm." I hummed as I looked out at the night sky. The city lights in
          the background shined brightly. Perhaps even encouragingly. "You all
          had strong arguments and sound points. With all your opinions in mind,
          I've come to a decision, Gentlemen. I say we go for the Platinum
          pull!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Two out of the four clones cheered while the other two sucked their
          teeth in annoyance. I reached forward and grabbed the floating Gacha
          machine's dial.
        </p>
        <p>"Use 3500 SP."</p>
        <p>
          I slowly twisted the dial as my clones stood behind me, their faces
          nervous but excited. We watched as the machine rumbled and glowed a
          bright silver as the plastic prize balls danced enticingly behind the
          machine's glass case. None of us breathed as we watched the lid
          finally snap open to reveal...

        <p>"I never doubted this choice for a second!"</p>
        <p>"Stop the cap."</p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, several loud bangs shook the door behind us as we all
          stopped our celebration. We all turned to look at the door I
          barricaded with a chair.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Who the hell is out there? I'm calling the police!" A loud, angry man
          shouted as he continued to bang repeatedly on his door.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Shit, no time to experiment," I said as all my clones melted away
          into CE. I spun on my heel and jumped off the roof balcony as the old
          geezer continued to yell.
        </p>
        <p>
          Leaping from rooftop to rooftop, my face broke into a grin as I raised
          my hands to make a hand seal of a dog.
        </p>
        <p>"Divine dogs!"</p>
        <p>
          Two loud howls filled the chilly night air as my mad laughter followed
          behind them. Causing dozens of once happily sleeping people to wake up
          in annoyance at the loud noise.
        </p>

        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          A man with long black hair looked around his surroundings with dry but
          calculating eyes. He was dressed in a black jumpsuit with a utility
          belt around his waist. On his feet were black boots, and a white
          rope-like cloth sat coiled around his neck. The man's name was Aizawa
          Shota, otherwise known as Eraser Head.
        </p>
        <p>"Any idea on what happened here, Eraser Head?"</p>
        <p>
          Aizawa turned to look at another fellow hero who had a black mask over
          his eyes and an attire similar to the armor Spartans would wear,
          including a green hooded cape and a black shirt that appeared to be
          stitched down the middle with a red pattern. This was the pro hero,
          Crust.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A few," Aizawa muttered as he looked around the large, dark
          warehouse.
        </p>
        <p>
          The abandoned warehouse Aizawa, Crust, and several police officers
          stood within loomed large, its weathered bricks crumbling and stained
          by years of neglect. Rusting metal beams jut out at odd angles, while
          shattered windows create a haunting mosaic of jagged glass. The air is
          thick with dust and blood, and the faint smell of mold lingers,
          hinting at the dampness that has seeped in over time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inside, the vast open space is filled with remnants of its former
          lifeârows of empty shelves and scattered debris litter the cold
          concrete floor. Sunlight streams through the broken windows, casting
          eerie shadows that dance across the walls. Graffiti tags splash colors
          against the drab interiors.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, what stood out the most in the warehouse were the several
          bloodied and bruised criminals strewn around everywhere, with even
          more outside being treated by first responders.
        </p>
        <p>"Slowly, slowly, okay! I got him!"</p>
        <p>
          Aizawa turned to see three police officers slowly bring down one of
          the unconscious men onto the ground. The man they had retrieved had
          been hanging upside down with a rope attached to his legs from one of
          the rafters above.
        </p>
        <p>
          Crust nodded in approval at the officer's teamwork and walked over to
          one of the large tables at the center of the warehouse. Stacked neatly
          on one another were several bags of narcotics and stolen support gear
          meant for heroes. Standing around the table were two officers taking
          inventory and pictures of the gathered contraband.
        </p>
        <p>
          Grabbing a bag full of colorful pills, Crust carefully inspected its
          contents before looking over to Aizawa. "Ecstasy." Crust said before
          placing the bag back. "Seeing that all this stuff is still hanging
          around, I'm guessing this is the work of vigilantes."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Possibly," Aizawa said as he crouched beside two empty duffle bags.
          He reached into one of the bags and pulled out a 10,000 yen bill.
          "Hmm, a deal gone wrong, then. If this was vigilantes, they made off
          with two or more bags full of money."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Eraser Head, Crust." One of the police officers, a woman with brown
          hair tied into a ponytail, said as she walked over to Aizawa and
          Crust. "One of them just woke up!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Aizawa and Crust turned to one another and nodded before following the
          officer. The three walked out of the warehouse, where several
          ambulances were parked and paramedics were treating the recovered
          criminals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The man had deep green skin and blue eyes. His hair was
          extraordinarily spiky and nonkept. Matching his loose attire. The man
          was covered in bruises and even bite marks resembling that of a large
          dog or wolf.
        </p>
        <p>
          "D-Demon. It was a demon!" The green-skinned man muttered in fear as
          he trembled. He then to the two pro heroes with almost a manic gaze.
          "That thing came out of the shadows and took us all out!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Slow down," Aizawa said as he raised his hands to try and calm the
          erratic man down. "Take a breath and calm down. Now, explain what
          happened here tonight. Who attacked you all?"
        </p>
        <p>
          The man held his head as his eyes began to tear up in fright and
          trauma.
        </p>
        <p>
          "This wasn't how tonight was supposed to go down, man. We were
          supposed to make the deal and get our money. But then that
          <i>thing </i>showed up and defeated us like we were nothing." The man
          said as he closed his eyes as if to keep away the mysterious
          boogeyman. "And that laugh... that Demon was laughing as it attacked
          us all one by one. Like this was a game!"
        </p>
        <p>
          Aizawa and Crust exchanged disturbed glances at each other. The nearby
          officers and paramedics, who were listening intently, began to grow
          concerned as they listened to the man's story.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did you happen to get a name?" Crust said softly, not wanting to
          frighten the scared and traumatized man any further. The man froze and
          turned to him and whispered.
        </p>
        <p>"It-<i>He </i>called himself ... Sukuna. The King of Curses"</p>

        <p>
          "There's one fundamental rule for interacting with others. You know
          what that is, you pile of dorks?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[13x5= +65 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I threw another chip into my mouth and looked down at the pile of
          bodies composed of middle schoolers. They all wore the same school
          uniform as me, but unlike me, theirs were dirty, bloodied, and even
          smelled of piss.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pile of students, some mutants and some not, beneath me all
          groaned and moaned in pain while a purple-haired student opened one of
          his unbruised eyes as he struggled to breathe from under me.
        </p>
        <p>"...what are you going on about, you quirkless- Gah!"</p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Shh. I'm doing a thing here." I said as my right fist found a new
          home in his stomach. "Now, where was I? Ah, that's right. The one
          fundamental rule for interacting with others is a simple one. I won't
          kill you, so in return, please don't kill me either. Substitute any
          word for kill. The point is drawing a line so you do not infringe on
          others. In order for both to exist together, they need to honor
          that... Or something like that. Do you guys get it?"
        </p>
        <p>"Not really."</p>
        <p>"I thought he was quirkless? How is he so strong?"</p>
        <p>"I c-cant breath..."</p>
        <p>
          I sighed and threw the half-eaten bag of chips at its original owner's
          face, who happened to be at the bottom of the pile that acted as my
          meat throne. "Yeah, me neither."
        </p>
        <p>Sorry, Megumi. I failed you.</p>
        <p>
          I stood up and climbed slowly down the pile of middle schoolers. Once
          I was back on the ground, I looked over at my creation and took a
          picture. Now, a sight like this would have normally brought attention
          to the surrounding student body. Thankfully, we were all on the south
          side of the school, away from all prying eyes and teachers.
        </p>
        <p>How did things end up like this? I hear you asking.</p>
        <p>
          Things 1, 2, and 3, from where I helped out Whatshisface a while back,
          had a bone to pick with me from when I slapped them silly. So, in
          retaliation, they gathered up a large group of their scummy friends to
          teach me a lesson.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a brief and easy lesson. It took all of three minutes for me to
          kick all their asses without sending them to the hospital. Hopefully,
          they're quick learners, so I didn't have to do this again.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oi, you three." I pointed at the three bozos from before, causing
          them all to whimper loudly.
        </p>
        <p>"Y-yes!?" The three shouted.</p>

          "This is your last warning. Mess with me again, and I'll rip your
          balls off. Oh, also, don't mess with that guy anymore, either. Ka...
          Ka-whatever, too."
        </p>
        <p>"...you mean, Kagawa?"</p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, him! In fact, I better not hear you three or any of you in that
          pile bullying anyone in this school. Got me?!" I said in a raised
          voice as I lifted my pristine knuckles at the large pile of middle
          schoolers.
        </p>
        <p>"We understand!" The loud, scared reply came from them all.</p>
        <p><strong>[13x5= +65 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I nodded and walked away from the meat pile to begin heading to work.
          Unaware of the several hidden onlookers watching from their hiding
          areas.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I walked, I wondered how long I would continue working for Minato.
          Money wasn't much of a problem anymore due to my book sales and
          recently acquired bags of cash, so there was little point in working
          for the low wage Minato was paying me. But if I did quit, then Mei and
          I would have less time to hang out or for me to earn some SP.
        </p>
        <p>"Hm, what to do?"</p>
        <p>
          I walked straight through the crowds of city folk, their bodies
          parting the way like the Red Sea. Confusion and nervousness were
          across their faces as they turned to me as I passed them.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Eh, fuck it. I'll keep working there. I owe Minato for the chance
          after all." I nodded as I reached the street where Hatsume's
          Mechanical Repairs and Such was located.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Yeah, that's the reason. It's not because I enjoy being around the

        </p>
        <p>Yeah, the cope is real.</p>
        <p>
          I walked through the store's front door and heard the familiar bell
          chime. "What do we get going on today, Hatsume-san?" Minato grinned at
          me as he looked up from the compound motor he was working on.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Ah, Souta. You're here. Hatake-san brought in a deep fryer from his
          restaurant, which has been giving him trouble. Can you take a-"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Souta!" I brazed myself as a blur of pink crashed into me. I looked
          over my shoulder to see Mei's smiling face covered in dirt and grime.
          "It's ready! Baby #18 is ready! You have to come look!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Hello to you too, Mei." I said as Mei let me go in favor of grabbing
          my hand to pull me off towards the back of the shop. Minato sighed and
          stood in her way, a dirty rag in his hands.
        </p>
        <p>"Not now, MeiMei. Souta has some work to do first."</p>
        <p>"Hah? Nah! My baby is so much more interesting than that!"</p>
        <p>
          "Souta is here to work, MeiMei. Not to help you invent future
          lawsuits."
        </p>
        <p>"I resent that!"</p>
        <p>
          I laughed at the father and daughter duo as they bickered about how I
          would spend my time today.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mei and I were so caught up in the moment that we didn't realize our
          fingers were intertwined.

        <p>
          I lazily moved left and right from the ridiculously slow,
          uncoordinated punches my green cash cow threw. I had my hands behind
          my back as I spun to the side and stuck out my foot, causing Izuku to
          trip forward.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah!" Izuku grunted as he rolled on the floor.</p>
        <p>
          "Hmm, this may be harder than I thought," I muttered as Izuku stood
          up. His clothes were covered in dust and dirt while a few stray leaves
          from the trees around us poked out from his bushy hair.
        </p>
        <p>
          Up in the tree branches watching us were three crows hidden within the
          leaves. As they watched, their little heads scanned around the area.
        </p>
        <p>(The green one should just give up. He's got two left feet.)</p>
        <p>(Nah, he'll get it soon.)</p>
        <p>(Salmon.)</p>
        <p>
          I ran a hand through my hair and watched as Izuku patted his clothes.
          Once he gathered himself, he took a deep breath and rushed me again.
          As I watched, a lone thought popped into my head.
        </p>
        <p><i>This kid is uncoordinated as heck.</i></p>
        <p>"Izuku, stop throwing all your weight behind your punches."</p>
        <p>
          I looked around the public park we were in and smacked another sloppy
          punch of his. I then tapped his forehead with my two pointer fingers,
          pushing him back onto the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gah! I-I'm trying! I'm just not good at this. All Might makes it look
          so easy. He beats the villains up in one punch!" Izuku said as he
          remained seated on the floor. He then smiled and punched the air. "He
          would just yell SMASH and Bam! The day is saved!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, but he's All Might. He can punch a hole in the atmosphere." I
          walked over to him and picked him up from the scruff of his shirt like
          a dog. "You, on the other hand, can barely do ten pushups without
          looking like you're about to pass out."
        </p>
        <p>"Sorry..."</p>
        <p>
          I sighed and placed my hands on his shoulders. "Don't be sorry, Izuku.
          Be
          <i>better</i>."
        </p>
        <p>Don't sue me, Santa Monica.</p>
        <p><strong>[+50 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Izuku looked at me with wide, awestruck eyes. Immediately, he nodded
          with renewed vigor and raised his arms into a poorly executed boxing
          stance.
        </p>
        <p>A far cry from the stance I taught him.</p>
        <p>But hey, he'll get it eventually.</p>
        <p>
          You see, for the past month or so, I've taken it upon myself to help
          my golden goose- I mean, my friend, to train up his skills and
          strength. My goal was to have him be in a much better state than in
          canon for when he receives All Might's quirk.
        </p>
        <p>It's the least I can do. He was the reason I got the Ten Shadows.</p>
        <p>
          That and I need to earn back my points after losing 7000 SP on those
          two failed Platinum pulls. Who knew my luck would run dry after that
          first pull?
        </p>
        <p>Damn, gacha. You unforgiving bitch.</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, let's take things slow." I stepped back and placed my hands
          behind my back. "This time, focus on your footwork and balance. Just
          keep up with me, and don't worry about landing a hit. Just stay on
          your feet, and don't let me trip you. Got it?"
        </p>
        <p>"Got it."</p>

        <p>
          For the next half hour, Izuku's performance has taken a turn for the
          better. This time, he focused his attention on staying on his feet and
          maintaining his balance. The times he did begin to lose his focus, I
          simply smacked his face lightly to bring back his focus. We continued
          on like this until his relatively short stamina finally ran out.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Izuku panting on the ground, I strolled through several trees to
          the area where I had left the red cooler I had brought and grabbed two
          water bottles. As I closed the cooler's lid, Crow Maki sent me a
          vision of three newcomers approaching Izuku and my location.
        </p>
        <p>Walking towards us were Bakugo and two of his followers.</p>
        <p>
          <i>Hm? It seems it's time for me to finally meet that headache.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to Crow Maki, Crow Inumaki, and Crow Panda, who was a crow and
          not a panda, I always had a clear view of my surroundings thanks to
          their overwatch. Those three made it almost impossible for anyone to
          sneak up on me without some sneaking quirk or super speed.
        </p>
        <p>"What the hell? Deku? The hell are you doing out here?"</p>
        <p>"K-Kacchan?!"</p>
        <p>"Wow, it really is Deku!"</p>
        <p>
          <i
            >That's what I get for choosing the local public park near Izuku's
            apartment.
          </i>
        </p>
        <p>
          I rolled my eyes and walked back to where I had left Izuku and found
          the spiky-haired, somehow fan-favorite, angry Pomeranian himself.
        </p>
        <p>Bakugo Katsuki.</p>
        <p>Oh, and his two cronies, too.</p>
        <p>
          My opinion of Bakugo Katsuki from the original series was that I
          didn't like him.
        </p>
        <p>
          The guy was an asshole to Izuku just because of his dreams and his
          quirklessness. The guy even told the green bean to kill himself. Not
          to mention the way he treats others due to his perceived greatness.
          And don't give that "Oh, but he had so much pressure on him to
          succeed" bullshit. That doesn't give you a pass to treat those around
          you like trash.
        </p>
        <p>
          But to be fair, I would give this Bakugo a chance to prove my
          preconceived opinions of his main timeline character wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bakugo was glaring at Izuku with annoyance as his hands twitched.
          Behind him was a long-haired boy with grey hair and droopy eyes, while
          the other boy had medium-length, unkempt black hair.
        </p>
        <p>"You following me around? Is that it, Deku?!"</p>
        <p>
          "N-No, that's not it, Kacchan. I was here t-training." Deku said in a
          meek voice as he tried to maintain eye contact with Bakugo. The two
          cronies behind the blonde chuckled as they watched Izuku shrink into
          himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Training? Don't tell me you still think you can be a hero?! I told
          you that a quirkless nobody like you has no chance of ever being one!
          So give up already!" Bakugo screamed as he got all up into Izuku's
          personal space as small explosions popped in his right hand.
        </p>
        <p><i>Never mind, fuck this guy.</i></p>
        <p>"Ka-Kacchan, I-"</p>
        <p>
          "Okay~" I walked out from behind the tree I was standing behind,
          surprising the three newcomers. "That's enough, you barking
          Pomeranian."
        </p>
        <p>
          "The hell did you say?!" Bakugo yelled as he ignored Izuku and stomped
          over to me. He was trying to look intimidating, but seeing an
          11-year-old throw a tantrum was anything but intimidating. "Who the
          hell do you think you are, you extra?!"
        </p>
        <p><i>Yesh. This is grating.</i></p>
        <p>"Kacchan, wait! He's my-"</p>
        <p>"Shut it, Deku! I'm talking here!"</p>

        <p>
          Izuku flinched as Bakugo turned to him with an annoyed, angry scowl. I
          rolled my eyes at Bakugo's constant screaming and rubbed the side of
          my head.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Man, you're so damn loud. Why is that? You hard of hearing or
          something?" I said as I walked over to Izuku and held out the water
          bottle in my hand. Izuku looked down at the cool beverage and accepted
          it numbly. Bakugo was stunned that I seemingly ignored and insulted
          him at once. "Get lost, will ya? My friend and I are working on some
          stuff. Now shoo~."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+150 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[+120 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          The two cronies at the back looked stunned and turned to one another
          in silent disbelief. Izuku was looking back and forth between Bakugo
          and me with large, worried eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >What's with these kids? They're treating Bakugo like the Grand
            Puba.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          I grinned as the sounds of repeating pops and cracks rippled behind
          me. I looked over to Bakugo and saw his face burn red with rage as his
          eyes shrank into slits.
        </p>
        <p>
          "You bastard! I'll kill you!" Bakugo dashed toward me as fast as he
          could with his right arm outstretched. His palm was glowing with small
          explosions as he
          <i>swung</i>.
        </p>
        <p><i>Smack!</i></p>
        <p>
          "You know, kid. Using your quirk on others for no reason isn't
          allowed." I said as Bakugo's face was half turned while a red
          handprint rested on his cheek from my slap. Slowly, he turned to look
          at me with wide, unbelieving eyes. "What's the matter? Cat got your
          tongue?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+100 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Growling in rage, Bakugo ran right at me with both arms flying
          forward, palms pointed right at me.
        </p>
        <p><i>Wham!</i></p>
        <p>
          "...huh?" Bakugo blinked as he stared up at the trees and sky from his
          spot on the floor.
        </p>
        <p><i>This is weirdly cathartic.</i></p>
        <p>
          "What's just happened?" The boy with long grey hair whispered as he
          and his friend stood frozen in place. The messy black-haired boy shook
          his head and rubbed his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>"I blinked and then... Bakugo-san was on the floor."</p>
        <p>
          "...Kacchan?" Izuku uttered as he stared at me and Bakugo in a
          delirium. It was as if he was watching something that couldn't be
          possible.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Hey, <i>Kacchan</i>. You ight?" I looked down at the blinking blonde
          with a large, mocking smile, my hands in my pockets. "How does it feel
          to have been beaten by someone who's <i>quirkless</i>?"
        </p>
        <p><i>Technically speaking.</i></p>
        <p><strong>[+170 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          What I had done was perform a quick and easy over-the-hip toss on
          Bakugo in the blink of an eye. Making it seem, to the untrained eye,
          as if Bakugo somehow just teleported on the floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          "...quirkless? You?" Bakugo muttered as he slowly stood to his feet.
          "Quirkless? Quirkless?!" He raged as he glared at me with fury. "As if
          I would get beaten by some quirkless loser!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+200 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Let's see, here we have someone with an okay quirk that can make
          explosions," I said while pointing at Bakugo with a lazy smile. I then
          pointed at myself. "And here, we have a quirkless nobody with no
          potential. Hmm... there's no way I could have beaten you. Isn't that
          what you're thinking?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I walked a few feet away and held my hands up with a lazy expression.
          "C'mon, boy. My two hands are all I need to wrangle you."
        </p>
        <p>"DIE!"</p>
        <p>
          Bakugo dashed toward me with rage-enhanced speed as his hands glowed
          from the accumulated sweat in his palms. Just as he was about to fire
          an explosion at point-blank range at my chest and face, my hands flew
          up and grabbed his wrists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pushing them outwards, his built-up sweat exploded beside me
          uselessly. Even after he released his explosions, I held his arms
          firmly in place in my vice grip as he tried to pull away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing the kid jerk around like a trapped animal, I felt a pang of
          sympathy for the young kid.
        </p>
        <p>
          "See?" I said with a calm expression. I leaned in close to his stunned
          face and whispered so only he would hear me. "Learn from this, Bakugo.
          If you keep looking down on everyone else, you'll never be able to see
          your own weaknesses."
        </p>
        <p>
          I leaned my head back and smashed my forehead into his own. Bakugo
          grunted in pain and fell onto his butt as his hands flew up to hold
          the growing welt on his head.
        </p>
        <p>"Agh!"</p>
        <p><strong>[+200 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>Don't worry. I was careful to hold back.</p>
        <p>
          With my piece said, I cracked my neck and walked over to Izuku. "Let's
          call it a day, Izuku. How about we go for some ice cream? My treat."
        </p>
        <p>"I... uh, huh?"</p>
        <p>
          I wrapped my arm around the stunned Izuku and led him out of the park
          after I grabbed my cooler.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the while, a frozen but enraged Bakugo stared at our backs with
          unreasonable hate in his eyes. His two friends? Followers? Whatever
          theory were, were too nervous and scared to say a thing and merely
          kept as silent as they could.

        <p>-</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          The old loading dock stood as a testament to years of bustling
          activity, its weathered wooden beams telling stories of countless
          shipments and deliveries. A faded sign hung above, its once-bright
          letters now peeling and barely legible, hinting at the dock's
          long-past glory days.
        </p>
        <p>
          Rusting metal fittings and heavy chains lay scattered around, remnants
          of the machinery that had once clattered with life. The air was thick
          with the scent of salt and aged wood, mingled with the faint aroma of
          oil and the ghosts of cargo that had been stacked high. Moonlight
          filtered through the gaps in the corrugated roof, casting streaks of
          light across the dark, cracked concrete floor.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pockmarked walls bore evidence of time's relentless march, with
          streaks of moss creeping in where rainwater had seeped through. A few
          scattered crates, long forgotten, sat in the corners, their
          once-bright colors dulled by the passage of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hoho! Not bad!" A large, pot-bellied man grinned as he looked inside
          one of the parked vans beside one of the loading bays. Sitting within
          the van were ten young children with their limbs tied together with
          rope; their mouths were covered with tape while their eyes were
          covered with blindfolds. "A very nice group tonight. Great work, as
          usual, Okuma-san."
        </p>
        <p>
          Okuma, a woman dressed in a two-piece business suit with long black
          hair and green eyes, smirked as she walked over to the other van. "I
          aim to please, Satoshi-san. There are so many desperate parents in a
          rush to begin their kid's hero careers that they'll more than be happy
          to hand them over to a
          <i>hero recruiter</i>." Okuma nodded to the two men standing beside
          the back doors of the other van.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the men nodded and opened the back door to reveal another group
          of bound, scared children. Seeing this, Satoshi laughed and stepped
          inside the van to inspect the children.
        </p>
        <p>
          The bound children were all shaking in fear as they sniffed and cried
          underneath their bindings. Satoshi stepped in front of a young
          brown-haired boy with dove-like wings on his back. The man then
          brushed the boy's wings slowly with a malicious grin.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yes, very nice. I think I'll give this one a run before we turn them
          in." Satoshi said lecherously, causing Okuma to look away in
          discomfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Remember that these kids bring in more profit if they're pure," Okuma
          said nonchalantly.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Yeah, yeah. It's fine. It's been a while since my last one, so I'll
          eat the pay cut." Satoshi said as he licked his lips. With a chuckle,
          he stepped out of the van and closed the doors behind him. "Alright.
          I'll take it from here."
        </p>
        <p>
          Satoshi pulled out his phone and tapped its screen. A soft ding pinged
          from Okuma's phone as she watched a large amount of money be deposited
          into her secured bank account.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I'll let you know when the next batch is ready." Okuma said as she
          turned away to begin walking over to her parked Handa across the
          street.
        </p>
        <p>
          "All right, boys! Let's get moving. I want to get to Hokkaido before
          morning!" Satoshi said as he turned to look at his two men, only to
          find them missing. In an instant, all the surrounding street lights
          that illuminated the area exploded. "What the hell? Where the fuck-"
        </p>

        <p><i>Crack!</i></p>
        <p>
          Satoshi jumped back in fright as Okuma's body fell directly in front
          of him from above, causing her to yell in pain as her right leg was
          snapped to the side. The woman screamed as she lifted herself up to
          look over to Satoshi.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah! H-help m-"</p>
        <p>"<i>Piercing blood.</i>"</p>
        <p>
          Satoshi's mouth opened in a silent scream as Okuma's head burst into a
          gory mess as an impossibly fast line of blood pierced through her
          skull. Satoshi took several steps back but then froze when the two
          thumps echoed behind him. The pot-bellied man, against his better
          judgment, turned to look behind him.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, lying on the ground with their bodies ripped to shreds as if
          they were mauled by a pack of dogs, were his men.
        </p>
        <p>
          "How many?" A low, dispassionate voice said from behind Satoshi,
          causing the man to jump. Satoshi watched in fear as a dark, hooded
          figure slowly emerged from the shadows. "How many kids have you
          taken?"
        </p>
        <p>"I... I-I don't..."</p>
        <p>
          Satoshi struggled to say before the hooded figure swiped his arm up.
          Two incredibly swift lines of blood flew through the air and stabbed
          through Satoshi's knees. Causing the man to yell in pain and fall to
          the ground. The hooded figure then pulled his arm back, and the two
          lines of blood retracted into his jacket sleeve.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Whatever. It doesn't matter." The hooded figure said as he walked
          over to the bleeding Satoshi. The figure reached down and took
          Satoshi's phone. The pot-bellied man pushed himself up as the hooded
          figure nodded over at... nothing? Satoshi blinked in confusion and
          looked back at his attacker.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Do it slowly. Ah, but drag him far away. I don't want the kids to
          hear." The hooded figure said and turned away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Satoshi was left confused, but he suddenly felt his arm explode in
          pain. "Aagh!" He looked over to his arm as several bleeding puncture
          wounds covered his skin. A sharp, jerking motion then pulled him to
          the ground as his body was quickly dragged along the ground by an
          invisible force.
        </p>
        <p>"Gah! What is this?! Let me go!"</p>
        <p>
          Satoshi turned his head back to the hooded man's back as he crouched
          next to the bodies of his men and Okuma. Without warning, their
          mangled bodies exploded into bright flames. The fire didn't last long
          because their bodies were reduced to ash in a few seconds from the
          intense heat.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was all Satoshi saw before he was dragged around the corner
          towards the pitch-black entrance of one of the loading docks abandoned
          electrical rooms.
        </p>
        <p>
          The door then slammed itself closed, stifling Satoshi's bloody screams
          of agony.

        <p>"All done?"</p>
        <p>
          I looked down at my divine dogs as they ran over to me from around the
          corner. They barked and nodded at my question as I looked down at the
          ugly man's phone. "Good. Now then, what should we do with these kids?"
        </p>

        <p>
          I walked over to both of the parked vans and pulled open their rear
          doors. Sitting inside both of the vehicles were around 19 or so kids.
          Each of them tied, blindfolded, and gagged. I stepped back to look
          around the old loading bay and shrugged. I reached into Zaiko's mouth
          and pulled out one of my many burner phones to dial the police.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hello? So, uh, there's two vans full of kidnapped kids in the old
          loading dock by Toyohashi City. Huh? My name? Sorry, can't give you
          that. Just send several of the boys in blue here, okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          I hung up the phone and crushed it into pieces. The sounds of
          whimpering and silent crying grabbed my attention as the kidnapped
          kids leaned on one another for comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
          There were children ranging from six to ten years old. All of which
          didn't seem to have any mutation-based quirks with the exception being
          the small boy with wings on his back. I looked around the area and saw
          that there weren't any traces of the violence that had just happened.
        </p>
        <p>Which was good; I didn't want to traumatize these kids.</p>
        <p>"All right, kiddies. Let's get you out of there."</p>
        <p>
          Over the next five minutes, I helped each of the kids out of their
          binds and took off their gags and blindfolds. Throughout the process,
          I slipped off my hoodie in favor of wearing my black Spider-Man mask.
          I didn't want to risk these kids recognizing me after tonight. My
          divine dogs were off in the background, keeping watch in case any more
          of the kidnapper's crewmates showed up.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once they were free and off the dirty old vans. The group of kids all
          looked around with fear and anxiety, which was fair. We were in some
          dark old loading dock with no light. One of the children, a little
          girl with bright blonde hair, walked up to me nervously.
        </p>
        <p>
          "U-um, M-Mister? Are you a h-hero?" The little girl asked, gaining
          everyone's attention.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A hero?" I said as I crouched down so I would be at their eye level.
          "I suppose, from your perspective, I am."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[3 x 19 = +57 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"See, I told you a hero would save us!"</p>
        <p>"Yeah! We'll get to go home soon!"</p>
        <p>
          My words caused a domino effect as all the kids visibly relaxed at the
          implication I was a hero. They all began to chatter happily and
          surrounded me to ask dozens of questions. The little blonde girl in
          front of me sighed in relief and smiled at me widely.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you for saving us, Mr. Hero!" The little girl said. "I'm Haru!
          I didn't ever give up hope that a hero would come save us."
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, yeah! A hero!"</p>
        <p>"Mr. Hero, your costume is so cool!"</p>
        <p>"What's your hero name, Mister?"</p>
        <p>
          "Okay, okay." I held my hands in front of me in an attempt to calm
          them all down. "Take it easy. My hero name? Well, I don't really have
          a
          <i>hero </i>name. But you kids can call me... Sukuna. How's that?"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[3 x 19 = +57 SP]</strong></p>

        <p>
          "Such a cool name!" A boy with short, grey hair and an All Might shirt
          said as he jumped up and down. "How did you find us, Sukuna?"
        </p>
        <p>
          They all grew quiet and waited for me to answer with smiles. Haru had
          walked closer and grabbed my left hand with a curious expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Might as well play the part. At least until the police get here.</i
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          "You see! I was patrolling the streets in a nearby city and heard your
          cries for help!" I said in a boisterous voice, similar to All Might.
          "I ran straight here in a flash and took down the evil villains. They
          all ran away crying at the sight of my power!"
        </p>
        <p>
          My claims caused everyone to cheer and yell in excitement. They
          showered me with praise and asked questions about what my quirk was or
          if I knew any other pro heroes. I laughed and indulged in their little
          questions for several minutes before the sounds of approaching police
          sirens could be heard. We all looked over to see flashing red and blue
          lights glow behind the loading dock's main building.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Okay, kids." I stood up and brushed some of their heads gently. "You
          all have to wait here for the nice police officers to take you all
          home, okay?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Huh? Aren't you going to stay?" A young boy with brown hair and dove
          wings, his name was Oki Katsu, said with sadness, causing everyone to
          whine and plead with me to stay. "Please stay, Mister Sukuna!"
        </p>
        <p>
          "I want to. I really do. But the policemen and women will take good
          care of you all. Besides, I think I hear more cries for help. You all
          want me to go save them like I saved you, right?" I said gently,
          causing the children to pout.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thankfully, they understood what I said and parted the way for me to
          leave. As I began to walk away, I turned back and looked at Haru.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haru, keep an eye on them for me, okay?" I said with a thumbs up,
          causing the little girl to nod and return the gesture.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>"I will! Now go save the day, Mister Sukuna!"</p>
        <p>
          I smiled behind my mask and made a show of powering up before leaping
          onto the roof of one of the vans before jumping onto the rooftops of
          the loading bay's main building. All the kids waved goodbye as several
          police cars and ambulances came to a stop several feet away.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dozens of officers poured out and approached the children with worry.
          Quickly and carefully, they guided the children to the paramedics to
          be checked and treated.
        </p>
        <p>
          I watched all this go down from the shadows on the rooftop; my divine
          dogs and crows were beside me as we peered down. I then pulled out the
          phone I took from the ugly, pot-bellied man and glared at the list of
          contacts on his phone. My eyes focused on the contact named "Boss
          Man."
        </p>
        <p>It wasn't my intention to play hero tonight.</p>
        <p>
          Running into these kids had been a coincidence from my usual nightly
          training routine. From what Crow Nobara found, I thought this was a
          simple drug deal for me to bust. But it turned out to be so much more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Human trafficking. Kidnapping. And other horrible crimes against
          children were something I detested now and in my previous life.
        </p>
        <p>
          So when I saw that these vans held several tied-up children, I acted
          and executed all these rabid dogs without mercy.
        </p>
        <p>
          My actions tonight had stopped Haru, Katsu, and all the other kids
          from tonight from disappearing and falling into the darkness of human
          evil due to the agendas of money-hungry degenerates.
        </p>
        <p>
          But seeing this long list of contacts on the corpse's phone, I knew
          that this wasn't the end of their operation. No, this was just the tip
          of the iceberg.
        </p>
        <p>I was no hero, and I knew that.</p>
        <p>But that fact just made what I was going to do next even easier.</p>
        <p>"Let's go <i>hunting</i>."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 18: NO. 18 - Pink Menace</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><i>...2 Years Later...</i></strong>
        </p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          The narrow alley was slick with rain, the asphalt glimmering under the
          dim streetlights as a middle-aged woman with black hair dressed in a
          blue raincoat ran. The woman's name was Fujioka Hisoka.
        </p>
        <p>
          Known in the underground world as "The Coil," she operated under a
          veil of secrecy, leaving behind nothing but whispered tales and a
          trail of chaos. Her background was shrouded in mystery; some said she
          was a runaway with a sharp mind and a fierce ambition, while others
          speculated about a more sinister lineage.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of her origins, she had a talent for slipping through the
          cracks of society, always one step ahead of the law. Her expertise
          lies in cunning heists, drug trafficking, embezzlement, murder, and
          human trafficking. Especially involving those with children with
          promising quirks.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a quick wit and a calm demeanor, Hisoka navigated the
          complexities of the criminal underworld, forging alliances and
          manipulating rivals to serve her purpose. Despite her darker traits,
          she was incredibly loyal to her boss. Hisoka would never do anything
          to put him at risk or capture.
        </p>
        <p>Even from the infamous Demon god himself.</p>
        <p>The King of Curses, Sukuna.</p>
        <p>The very same Demon that was chasing her down like prey.</p>
        <p>
          Hisoka's heart pounded in her ears as she sprinted through the
          shadows. As she ran, she looked back in fright only to see nothing
          behind her. Despite that, she continued running. Her grey eyes were
          wide with fear as they looked around wildly.
        </p>
        <p>
          She turned sharply, narrowly avoiding a trash can that clattered to
          the ground behind her. The adrenaline surged through her veins,
          propelling her forward. Every breath felt sharp in her lungs. With a
          grimace, Hisoka crouched low and jumped onto the wall to her right,
          and springboarded herself back and forth down the alley.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hisoka's quirk, Repeated Hopping, allowed her to use her legs like
          coiled springs to jump off nearby surfaces, similar to a pinball, to
          travel at greater speeds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scent of damp concrete filled the air as she bounced past a closed
          shop front, her mind racing to find an escape route.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hisoka's instincts kicked in; she veered to the right, cutting through
          a narrow pathway that twisted between two buildings with a long jump.
          The darkness enveloped her like a cloak, but she knew her pursuer was
          relentless.
        </p>
        <p>
          She knew once the Demon God found you, he would stop at nothing to get
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hisoka didn't want to end up like all her now-dead crewmates. All dead
          at the hands of that man.
        </p>
        <p>
          Suddenly, she heard what sounded like a crow's caw above her, causing
          her to look up and momentarily lose focus of her quirk, sending her
          crashing along the wet ground in a painful roll.
        </p>
        <p>"Heheh. Go on, get up and run. Run!"</p>
        <p>
          Hisoka quickly crawled to her feet at the sound of the voice. Panic,
          fear, dread, and many more emotions surged within her. She needed a
          plan. She needed to escape!
        </p>

        <p>'I don't want to die!' Hisoka screamed in her head.</p>
        <p>
          Up ahead, a chain-link fence loomed. She leaped toward it, fingers
          gripping the cold metal. Just as she scrambled over the top, something
          solid coiled around her left leg and <i>pulled </i>her back.
        </p>
        <p>"Ah! Let me go!"</p>
        <p>
          Hisoka's chin slammed on the hard ground, causing her head to swim as
          the pain of her body being dragged along the rough ground pulsed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking down at her leg, Hisoka saw a thick red liquid-like rope tied
          around her leg. She couldn't help but wonder if that was blood. Her
          eyes followed the rope to its point of origin, only to find a shadowed
          figure down the alleyway.
        </p>
        <p>
          The visage of the mysterious figure caused a wave of panic through
          her.
        </p>
        <p>It was him.</p>
        <p>It was Sukuna.</p>
        <p>
          The very man who threw a large portion of Japan's underworld into
          uncontrolled chaos. The killer of criminals and villains alike with no
          mercy.
        </p>
        <p>"No! No! <i>Let me go!</i>"</p>
        <p>
          Reaching down, Hisoka tried to remove the red rope from her leg in a
          frenzy. Her once well-manicured nails dug into the rope and her skin,
          but the most she did was scratch and rip her flesh. Leaving the rope
          undamaged. Hot tears streamed out of her eyes as she finally came to a
          stop; slowly, she looked up at the pair of cold, amused eyes looming
          over her.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Well, that was fun." Sukuna's low, rough voice said as he reached
          down and grabbed the top of her head with his gloved right hand.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hisoka whined and fought to remove his hand from her head, but his
          grip was ironclad. The man, no, the <i>Demon </i>before her, then
          effortlessly lifted her up and held her above the ground, the pressure
          around her skull increasing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hisoka whimpered as she desperately tried to remove the Demon's hand
          from her person, but she then made the mistake of looking down at
          <i>his </i>face in her panic, causing her to freeze like a rabbit.
        </p>
        <p>
          A wide, merciless smile looked at her in amusement as his black eyes
          peered straight into her soul from beneath the black hood and high
          white collar. What stood out the most were the sharp, black tattoos
          that adorned his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now then, enough games. Where's your boss at? Oh, and I suggest you
          answer me quickly. It'll hurt a lot less if you do..."

        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[Shimizu Souta POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I let out a deep, long yawn as I used my hand to cover my mouth. I
          then smacked my lips and blearily looked around the empty storefront
          of Hatsume's Mechanical Repairs and Such. I was wearing my work
          uniform over a pair of casual clothes, the uniform being a simple
          black apron.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Hmm, you getting enough sleep, Souta?" Minato asked me from his spot
          on a stool where he was watching a baseball game from the small
          television set on the far left counter. "You know, a young man like
          yourself needs his full eight hours to develop properly."
        </p>
        <p>"Oh, yeah? How many hours of sleep does Mei get?"</p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "...barely six. It helps that she doesn't know that the candy she
          snacks on at night are actually melatonin gummies."
        </p>
        <p>"Smart."</p>
        <p>
          Minato then stretched his back and looked at me with a stern look,
          like a father would give to their misbehaving son. "Still, you should
          try to get some more sleep. You up all night playing those video games
          or something?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Nah, I was just up late... studying," I said with a small grin as I
          pulled out a book from under the counter. "Don't worry, Hatsume-san.
          I'm getting my sleep. Thanks for the concern."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          Minato smiled and nodded at my answer. He then turned back to watch
          his game as I read my book. The book was on the Meta Liberation War.
          It was actuallya very interesting read; there were a lot of points I
          agreed with within it and some that I didn't.
        </p>
        <p><i>Rumble!</i></p>
        <p>
          Minato and I looked at one another as the store rumbled around us. We
          turned back as a muffled explosion could be heard behind us. I stood
          up and closed my book while sighing.
        </p>
        <p>"I got this one."</p>
        <p>
          "Don't forget the fire extinguisher," Minato said as he turned back to
          watch his game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Walking towards the back of the store, I grabbed the fire extinguisher
          from its case and slipped on my outdoor shoes. As I did, I looked up
          at the large mirror set beside the coat rack to see my reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was now 170 centimeters tall, placing me slightly above average for
          young Japanese boys like myself. My looks had changed quite a bit as
          well.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was the result of puberty, alongside my training, nightly
          excursions, and the constant flow of curse energy within me. Who knew
          CE had a passive effect of boosting my body?
        </p>
        <p>
          That almost makes up for the fact that everyone I encounter looks at
          me like a crook or a creep.
        </p>
        <p>Almost.</p>
        <p>
          My body was well-muscled and defined. A few scars littered my body,
          with the most prominent scar being the one on my neck from my fight
          with Stain. Fuck that guy. My face and hair looked very similar to
          Megumi's, and my sharp eyes took after Toji himself.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gueh," Zaiko muttered from over my shoulder. Pulling me out of my
          observation of myself.
        </p>

        <p>"Right. Mei."</p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, I reached a large newly built shed/workshop located
          several meters away from the store's main building. I rolled my eyes
          at the sight of the wisps of black smoke rolling out of the workshop's
          open windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mei!" I yelled as I entered the smoking workshop, my free hand waving
          the bellowing smoke away. "You alive?"
        </p>
        <p>"Haha! Success! A major success!"</p>
        <p>
          I heard Mei excitedly yell from somewhere within the smoke. I found
          myself smiling at her mad cackles and walked over to the right wall
          where a large switch was located. Flipping it, several load fans came
          to life and quickly sucked out all the smoke upwards toward the large
          ventilation system Minato and I built.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the smoke now gone, I took a look around the large workshop with
          a proud smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop was a unique blend of controlled chaos, innovation, and,
          above all, a passion for engineering. As you step inside, you're
          greeted by the sight of messily organized tools hanging on a magnetic
          wall.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop features expansive workbenches made from sturdy hardwood,
          each meticulously designed and dedicated to specific tasksâmachining,
          welding, or assembly. Overhead, bright LED lights illuminate every
          corner, ensuring that even the tiniest detail is visible. Walls are
          adorned with pegboards displaying an array of tools, from wrenches to
          calipers, all easily accessible.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the heart of the workshop is a large CNC machine, its sleek design
          signifying advanced technology. Nearby, a lathe and milling machine
          stood at the ready, showcasing a mix of traditional craftsmanship and
          modern innovation. Perfect for crazy steampunk enthusiasts.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a designated area for prototyping, filled with creative
          sketches pinned to a board, alongside 3D printers actively producing
          the latest designs. Adjacent to this is an ample open space designated
          for testing finished inventions. This area had signs of heavy use,
          with visible burns and dents from Mei's various tests and mishaps.
        </p>
        <p>
          The air is tinged with the lingering smell of smoke and various
          materials; metal shavings mix with the scent of fresh paint coming
          from the painting booth, where pieces are completed with a focus on
          both aesthetics and durability.
        </p>
        <p>
          The workshop also boasts a small, comfortable lounge area, complete
          with a coffee brewer and a large basket full of chocolates, where Mei
          would sometimes take a brief moment to recharge her creativity. Off to
          the back corner was the ever-growing pile of inventions Mei had
          created over the course of two years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, the mechanical workshop Minato and I built as a gift for
          Mei's 13th birthday was a pretty impressive sight, equipped for
          productivity and the creative exploration of engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mei, what did your dad and I say about explosions? If you're going to
          cause one, have the filtration fans on." I said as I placed the fire
          extinguisher on a nearby table, no longer needing it due to a lack of
          ongoing fires.
        </p>
        <p>
          There, standing next to the designated area for testing, was Mei in
          all her dirt, grime, and oil-covered glory. Her long pink hair was
          pulled into a high ponytail as her newly made steampunk goggles sat
          over her eyes. She wore thick mechanical overalls over her lower body
          while the upper half of the overalls were tied around her waist to
          expose a black tank top over her upper body. Around her waist was a
          brown belt full of tools.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mei pulled her goggles off her eyes and over her head as she turned to
          me with a giant megawatt smile. "Souta! Look, look! My newest baby is
          ready!" Mei ran over to me and pulled over to her latest and greatest
          creation. "Isn't it beautiful?!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          I hummed and looked over the impressive-looking mechanical robot. It
          heavily resembled Diva's mechanical mech from Overwatch, a game from
          my original world, in its construction. However, unlike Diva's mech,
          Mei's was much smaller and had a bulkier design. Despite that, it was
          extremely impressive.
        </p>
        <p>
          "It's freakin awesome," I said with a smile as I walked around the
          mech to inspect all of Mei's work. Mei grinned as she followed behind
          me with her hands behind her back. "Nice work on the coupling here. I
          see; this undercut you added will definitely help with the mech's
          lateral movement. Very nice, Mei." We stopped in front of the mech,
          our eyes locked on the machine's tiny cockpit. "I think this may be
          your best baby yet!"
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+30 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Really?!" Mei said with a large smile. Her cheeks were a tinge of
          pink.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Absolutely. But I think it can get better than this." I said as I
          held my chin in thought, my mind whirling. "I think you can improve
          its design by streamlining the mech's limbs. Improving the speed and
          reducing its overall weight. Yeah, there's definitely more you can
          do."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mei nodded along to my suggestions as she wrote down several new notes
          and sketches on a notepad she pulled from... somewhere.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Mhm! Yes, I see what you mean. Frankly, I felt I could have done
          better with the size of my baby's arms and legs, but then I wouldn't
          be able to include the missiles and booster jets." Mei said
          nonchalantly as I froze.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Haha, you're kidding, right?" I said with a nervous smile as I looked
          at the pink-haired menace I called my friend. She turned to me, her
          smile widening, but offered no answer to my question.
        </p>
        <p>"You're kidding... right? <i>Right?</i>"</p>

        <h2>Chapter 19: NO. 19 - News Bulletin</h2>
        <p>
          "Keiko, don't stop moving! Izuku, stop overthinking it and follow your
          instincts!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I continued to watch the future number one hero try and run around a
          quick-moving blue barrier held up by a tired blue-haired girl. Izuku's
          calculating eyes followed the barrier created by Keiko's quirk and
          halted when he found a small opening due to her swaying her arms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grinned when Izuku leaned down and exploded forward with impressive
          speed (for him) around Keiko's defense, causing the girl's eyes to
          widen. Izuku dashed forward with determination and reached out to grab
          Keiko with his dirty and bruised hands.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Take this!" Keiko jumped back as she let go of her current barrier in
          favor of clapping her hands. Izuku tried to correct his course but was
          suddenly pushed to the side by a fast-moving wave of erratic energy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <i
            >Good. It looks like you're getting used to using your defensive
            barrier offensively. </i
          >I grinned as Keiko fell to a knee due to her tired state, her face
          covered in sweat.
          <i>Still, she's using too much energy. We'll work on that.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          "Geh! So close." Izuku slid to a stop from the force of Keiko's
          attack. His chest was rising and falling quickly as he rested on the
          ground. "Y-you really have an amazing quirk, Hase-san."
        </p>
        <p>
          "T-thank you, Izuku-kun." Keiko smiled tiredly as she tried to stand
          but failed due to her shaky legs. "But I think you're the amazing one
          here. You've gotten so much faster that it's getting hard for me to
          keep up with you now."
        </p>
        <p>
          The green-haired nerd's eyes grew wide as an embarrassed blush spread
          on his face. His right hand was rubbing the back of his head as a true
          embarrassed protagonist would.
        </p>
        <p>
          "T-that's not true! It's all thanks to Souta-san's training.
          Otherwise, I wouldn't stand a chance."
        </p>
        <p>
          With a sigh, I stood up from the lawn chair I had been sitting on for
          the past twenty minutes and walked over to Izuku. As I walked, I
          passed by Keiko and patted her head, eliciting a small smile from the
          girl.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I thought I knocked that self-deprecating habit out of you, Izuku," I
          said as I lightly slammed the bottom of my fist on his bushy green and
          black hair. "Don't tell me you forgot. I suppose I can give you
          another lesson then."
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+10 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "N-no! Sorry! It just sort of slipped out..." Izuku looked panicked as
          he rose to stand, his hands waving around in front of him. He then
          looked over to Keiko and jogged towards her. "Oh, look! Hase-san looks
          like she needs help getting up!"
        </p>
        <p>"Yeah, yeah. Go run and hide behind Keiko's skirt."</p>
        <p>"But I'm not wearing a skirt."</p>
        <p>
          I shook my head and looked around at the rather impressive backyard of
          Keiko's house. The backyard stretched out like a canvas, wide and
          inviting, with lush green grass blanketing the ground. Towering trees
          line the perimeter, their leaves rustling softly in the breeze and
          providing dappled sunlight in scattered patches while a wooden fence
          encircles the space.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, it made for the perfect training spot for both Keiko and
          Izuku.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then again, any place where that brat Bakugo didn't pop up was
          perfect.
        </p>
        <p>
          Looking over toward the green-haired ball of kindness, I thought back
          to the two years I had spent molding and teaching the kid martial arts
          while strengthening his once-skinny body.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to all that time whipping his butt into shape, Izuku was now a
          decent fighter who could stand toe-to-toe with any kid in his age
          bracket in a pure hand-to-hand fight. If someone took a closer look at
          my ball of clay, they would be able to notice the lith but strong
          muscles on his frame, even from under his baggy clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also tried to toughen up his mindset so he wouldn't be such a
          pushover, but my progress was slow on that front. Additionally, Keiko
          didn't approve of my "Bullying," as she called it. Severely slowing
          down my progress on turning Izuku into a confident, ass-kicking
          protagonist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I smiled as I watched my two friends/students talk excitedly with one
          another from their spots on the wooden bench they sat on. They were
          going over their performance in today's sparring session. While they
          talked, Keiko's mother walked out with a tray of drinks for them with
          a loving smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Hmm, perhaps your energy reserves for your quirk coincides with each
          clap of your hands? Have you ever noticed a strain with each clap you
          do, Hase-san?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Now that you mention it, I think I do feel a slight pull whenever I
          activate my quirk. I can't believe I never noticed. You're so smart,
          Izuku-kun!"
        </p>
        <p>
          I introduced Izuku to Keiko around a year and a half ago when I
          decided that if I was going to train him, I might as well train Keiko
          so she would be a heavy hitter if she does get into UA or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing what future that school had, I'd prefer it if she went to
          Shiketsu.
        </p>
        <p>
          At first, Izuku was extremely nervous at the fact he was talking to a
          girl, but Keiko's bright and happy disposition quickly melted away his
          awkward nervousness.
        </p>
        <p>Sorta.</p>
        <p>
          Fine, it took him around a month or so to talk to her without any
          issues.
        </p>

        <p>
          Keiko herself accepted Izuku as her friend immediately, which didn't
          shock me whatsoever. She always had an easy time making friends if
          going off the way everyone at the orphanage loved her was anything to
          go off by. It also helped that the two of them coincidentally went to
          Aldera Junior High.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, while I had Izuku work on his body strength and techniques, I
          focused on getting Keiko's quirk to level up beyond what she
          originally could do. Using my rather extensive knowledge of all twelve
          of my cursed techniques as a base, Izuku and I were able to quickly
          brainstorm all of the possibilities Keiko's quirk could have.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of our ideas were moving barriers, vertical and horizontal
          positioning, floating disks so she could essentially walk on air,
          fast-moving concentrated barriers to use offensively, and so much
          more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keiko had a highly versatile quirk that could be used for so much more
          than just simple shields. Despite that, getting her to the point of
          actually implementing all of our ideas was a slow climb up a very
          steep mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          So far, Keiko has only been capable of performing moving barriers,
          vertical and horizontal positioning, and fast-moving concentrated
          barriers to use offensively. And even that last one was a work in
          progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, she was slowly growing, and there was no doubt in my mind that
          my friend would be more than ready for any hero school she got into in
          three years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Training wasn't all the three of us did. We also did the typical
          activities most young teenagers do as well. Going out to watch movies,
          wasting time around the local mall, hanging out at one another's
          houses (except mine, for reasons), and a lot of other activities.
        </p>
        <p>
          All this time spent together caused the two of them to grow pretty
          close to one another while I tagged along. Having two genuine friends,
          or an awesome sensei like me, so early on in his life had the added
          effect of increasing Izuku's self-esteem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Which was a plus in my book. I needed him to be ready for when shit
          hits the fan in case I'm not around.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would have introduced these two to Mei, but with her personality,
          she might just ignore them for a few weeks before even bothering to
          remember their names. Still, I'd give it a go when she finally decides
          to get out of her workshop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, I'm going to have to force her to go outside, if I'm being
          honest.
        </p>
        <p>"Souta-kun."</p>
        <p>
          I was nudged out of my thoughts as Keiko's mother walked up to me with
          a motherly smile and a glass of fresh lemonade in her hands. "Would
          you like a drink?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Thank you, Yoshiyuki-san. This is just what I needed." I accepted the
          drink with a smile and took several sips. Causing the older woman to
          smile.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[+5 SP]</strong></p>
        <p>
          "Huh? Weren't you sitting around the entire time, Sou-chan? Why are
          <i>you </i>thirsty?" Keiko asked as she looked at me with squinted
          eyes. Izuku tried to look away while covering his mouth to hide the
          amused smile on his face.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Teaching is a hard job that requires nourishment, Keiko. That's why."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Oh, is that what you call it? I always thought it was because you
          were lazy." Keiko said with a large, bright smile.
        </p>
        <p>"...I don't like this new snarky attitude, Keiko."</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p>"Nue."</p>
        <p>
          Rising from the shadows arose a large owl-like creature with orange
          feathers and a white mask-like skull. Its large wings stretched and
          flapped in the wind as two sets of talons stepped around on the
          rooftop we stood on. Its mask-like face and human-like teeth looked
          around the area before settling on me.
        </p>
        <p>
          I grinned at the large bird shikigami and jumped onto its back.
          Without waiting for a command, Nue flapped its wings and took flight.
        </p>
        <p>
          As the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of
          orange and pink, Nue soared high above the sprawling cityscape. I felt
          the rush of wind against my face and hair as we glided across the sky;
          the sensation of freedom filled my lungs.
        </p>
        <p>"Ahh, I'll never get tired of this."</p>
        <p>
          Below, the city pulsed with lifeâcars streamed along the streets,
          their headlights twinkling like stars, while the rhythmic hum of urban
          existence created a symphony of sounds. Skyscrapers reached toward the
          sky, their glass facades reflecting the fiery colors of sunset.
        </p>
        <p>
          If anyone were to look in my direction, they would see someone soaring
          through the air in a seated position without assistance.
        </p>
        <p>Quite the funny sight.</p>
        <p>
          With each movement, Nue and I glided effortlessly, weaving through the
          clouds that dotted the twilight sky. I gazed down at the parks
          speckled among the concrete, where small clusters of people enjoyed
          their evening and distant bridges that connected different parts of
          the city like veins in a living organism.
        </p>
        <p>
          As we continued on our journey above, the lights below began to blink
          on, transforming the ground below into a vibrant tapestry of
          flickering colors. It was a breathtaking view, a moment of tranquility
          amidst the bustling chaos below.
        </p>
        <p>There truly wasn't anything like soaring through the skies.</p>
        <p>
          Sure, I could fly like Yorozu did with her bug-like wings using my
          Construction technique. But I liked riding on Nue a lot more. Sitting
          on my shikigami's back as it soared through the sky reminded me of how
          Goku rode on his Nimbus cloud.
        </p>

        <p>I was living the dream.</p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the sight of a large, black dome in the far-off
          mountains came into view. Nue tilted its wings, and we began to
          descend toward the black dome or, as I know it, a curtain.
        </p>
        <p>
          My shikigami and I glided right through the curtain with no issue, and
          the sight of a large Japanese-style building surrounded by a
          ten-foot-tall stone wall surrounded by thick trees came into view.
        </p>
        <p>
          Soon enough, Nue landed on the large open courtyard of the property
          and quickly melted into my shadows after I gave it a thankful pat on
          its wings once I was on the ground.
        </p>
        <p>I looked around my large home and grinned.</p>
        <p>Yes, <i>my </i>home.</p>
        <p>
          I had run into this property a year ago during one of my nightly runs
          when I tracked down a band of Yakuza I thought worked for the Shie
          Hassaikai, the organization led by Overhaul. Unfortunately, the group
          of Yakuza I found wasn't affiliated with the child-abusing assholes
          and was instead a part of a different group.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh, that didn't mean that I was going to let these guys go. No, these
          guys had partaken in several horrible acts such as human trafficking,
          drug smuggling, child pornography, Extortion, weapons smuggling, and
          assassination.
        </p>
        <p>
          How did I know this? Well, after you torture a few of their captured
          grunts for a day, they'll sing and tell you anything you want.
        </p>
        <p>Not a very heroic thing to do, but what can I say?</p>
        <p>I ain't no hero.</p>
        <p>I was simply someone who did as they liked.</p>
        <p>
          Whether that be taking out a band of murderous villains or beating a
          power-drunk hero's face in, it didn't matter. I did as I wanted for my
          own amusement and interest.
        </p>
        <p>
          This was a mindset I had adopted around a year ago or so. Finding and
          getting rid of some of society's worst members who conducted some
          really abhorrent activities can change one's mindset really quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm not sure when it was when I no longer blinked at the act of
          killing those who deserved it. It must have been when I found that one
          rabid dog who called himself a man in the middle of cutting a young
          14-year-old girl into pieces after he had violated her for several
          hours.
        </p>
        <p>Shit like that really messes with one's head...</p>
        <p>Now, where was I?</p>
        <p>Ah, right. My house.</p>
        <p>
          After getting the confessions of their group's crimes from my captured
          yakuza members, I found no issue with stepping foot into their
          property and eliminating everyone inside.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cleaning out all the Yakuza was quick with the help of the Ten Shadows
          technique and alongside my clones. We struck at the dead of night and
          took everyone out from the shadows with quick effecientness like
          ninjas.
        </p>
        <p>
          It also helped that these Yakuza weren't all that strong, too. Sure,
          there were some of them who had some impressive quirks, but they
          weren't much help when they weren't given the time to be used.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once everyone was gone, all the compound needed was a thorough
          cleaning and enhanced security in the form of several well-placed
          seals, creating three strong curtains around the property.
        </p>
        <p>
          I didn't expect the silver-tier rewardâIjichi Kiyotaka's barrier
          skillsâto be useful, but I was pleasantly surprised.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, if any people approached the barrier without my permission, they
          would experience a strong sense of confusion and be compelled to turn
          around and leave. It was a rather simple but extremely strong warding
          barrier that would keep all those darn kids and the government off my
          property.
        </p>
        <p>
          And if somehow they did get past the first curtain, there were two
          others ready to ward them away with even stronger defenses.
        </p>
        <p>
          The property itself heavily resembled the one from the Emiya residence
          from the Fate series. This means that it had several Japanese-style
          rooms throughout the main household and a storage room in the backyard
          beside the courtyard. Off on the right side of the courtyard was a
          well-sized building the Yakuza mostly used for storage that I turned
          into a dojo.
        </p>
        <p>
          Attached to the rooftops of the main building were several solar
          panels I created using my construction technique. Something I wouldn't
          have been able to do if I hadn't gotten Tsukumo Yuki's<i> </i>CE
          reserves to help power my technique. She wasn't a Special Grade
          Sorcerer for nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          This ensured my property was self-sufficient when it came to power.
        </p>
        <p>
          When it came to the water, I effortlessly created a highly efficient
          water transport/filtration system using my mechanical knowledge and my
          Construction Technique. So, after hooking up my new filtration system
          to a nearby flowing river, I now had super clean, free-running water
          for my self-sufficient house.
        </p>
        <p>What about the orphanage? I can hear some of you ask.</p>
        <p>
          Surely, I didn't just disappear on them again. I was still a barely
          15-year-old kid in their eyes, after all. There's no way they would be
          okay with me moving into my own home without an adult guardian. ?
        </p>

        <p>
          The answer to that problem was to send a clone in my place to keep up
          appearances.
        </p>
        <p>What an unlucky fellow.</p>
        <p>
          Deciding I had stared at my property long enough, I walked through the
          back door and removed my shoes.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I may not have been Japanese in my past life, I appreciated the
          way they didn't wear shoes inside. Kept the floors clean. I walked
          past the room I used as my library and stepped into my kitchen to grab
          an apple. On the shelves in my library were several books and manga.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of these were books 1-3 of The Hunger Games, Episodes 1 and 2 of
          Star Wars, and the first entry to the Harry Potter series. Twelve
          physical volumes of my TMNT manga sat beside volumes 1, 2, and 3 of
          Dragon Ball Z.
        </p>
        <p>
          There was even a poster for the recently released TMNT TV anime by
          studio NAPPA in a frame as well. I've truly made it as a Mangaka with
          that milestone.
        </p>
        <p>
          My editor, Asuka, was over the moon now that one of her Mangakas
          finally got an anime adaptation for their series. In celebration, she
          took me out to one of Japan's most expensive sushi restaurants in
          Tokyo.
        </p>
        <p>
          The fool. I sure made her regret that decision when she got the bill.
        </p>
        <p>
          Safe to say, my career as a writer/Mangaka has been very successful so
          far.
        </p>
        <p>Now, all I needed was to get some movie adaptations for my books.</p>
        <p>
          I threw myself on my large L-couch and turned on the 80-inch OLED
          television. The television opened to a news channel where a
          brown-haired newscaster with a purple top looked up from her stack of
          papers. A large black and red title sat in bold letters near the
          bottom.
        </p>
        <p>Shocking News! Why?! Bloody Tragedy at Corellia Junior High!</p>
        <p>
          "Sources tell us that the middle school student who mauled her
          classmate, injuring him severely, is still on the run. No information
          on the attack has been offered as of yet." The newscaster said with a
          disturbed expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          The picture changed to a male student, but his face was hidden from
          view. "Toga was always smiling and friendly... I can't believe she'd
          do something so brutal."
        </p>
        <p>
          The picture changed again to a scared girl, her face also hidden from
          view." I saw her... Toga. She stuck a straw into Saito's and sucked on
          it. It was like she was in a trance."
        </p>
        <p>
          I clicked off the television and sat up on my couch, my hands
          underneath my chin.
        </p>
        <p>Toga Himiko.</p>
        <p>
          She was one of the main antagonists from the original series. If left
          unchecked, Toga would one day be a member of the League of Villains,
          affiliated with the Vanguard Action Squad, and later becoming one of
          the nine lieutenants of the Paranormal Liberation Front.
        </p>
        <p>
          Besides all her fancy titles and positions, Toga was also a girl who
          was mentally unstable due to the years of mental and possibly physical
          abuse from her parents due to her nature. She was a person who was
          pushed to her breaking point until she finally snapped and attacked
          her classmate.
        </p>
        <p><i>"That child is a... demon."</i></p>
        <p><i>"That smile, so creepy! Stop it!"</i></p>
        <p>
          <i>"Why can't you be a regular girl? Why can't you be normal?!"</i>
        </p>
        <p>
          The words her parents said to Toga when she was a child must have left
          deep mental scars in her psyche. No wonder she went crazy.
        </p>
        <p>"Now then... what do I do?"</p>
        <p>I have two choices in front of me right now.</p>
        <p>
          Option one, I do nothing and let things proceed like they would in
          canon. This would keep the timeline as close to the one in canon,
          giving me the edge when Shigaraki and the League start their
          shenanigans.
        </p>
        <p>
          Option two, I start a search for Toga and help her go through her
          issues so she doesn't go down the road of villainy. While I'm not sure
          what happened to her at the end of the story, if it ever did end, with
          her status as a killer and a member of the League of Villains, I doubt
          she had a happy ending.
        </p>
        <p>
          "I don't know... she may be more trouble than she's worth." I ran my
          fingers through my hair as I tried to make up my mind. "Still, she
          would be a great constant stream of points."
        </p>
        <p>
          Coming to a decision, I stood up from my couch and walked out of my
          living room toward the back door. I slid the door open to step out
          into my back patio. Once outside, I looked up and whistled. Quickly,
          several of my crows flew down from their large birdhouse full of
          fruits, seeds, and corn to stand at attention before me.
        </p>
        <p>
          Standing in a neat, orderly line were Crow Gojo, Geto, Shoko, MeiMei,
          Yuji, Nobara, Mai, Miwa, Momo, Todo, Yuta, and Hakari.
        </p>
        <p>"Alright, everyone. I have a job for you."</p>

        <h2>Chapter 20: NO. 20 - Unwanted Attention</h2>
        <p>
          The morning sun hung low in the sky, casting a warm golden hue over my
          home's courtyard. I stood at the center, my bare feet planted firmly
          on the cool dirt floor, the earthy scent of the surrounding trees
          filling the air. A heavy, scuffed punching bag hung on a steel pole in
          front of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          With each steady breath I took, I felt my curse energy course through
          my body. I began with a series of slow, deliberate movements, focusing
          on my several stances.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each pose was a dance of strength and balance, cultivating a
          connection between my body and the ground. The rhythm of my breath
          matched the flow of my motions, creating a zone-like state that
          brought me into the moment. As I transitioned from one stance to
          another, I visualized an ever-changing opponent before me.
        </p>
        <p>
          All For One, Shigiraki, Overhaul, Nine, Wolfram, The Nomus, Muscular,
          and many more.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a sudden burst of energy, I launched into a series of punches and
          kicks, my limbs slicing through the air with precision. The sound of
          skin meeting the heavy bag echoed around me. Each satisfying thud
          motivated me to push harder and harder. Sweat began to bead on my
          forehead, but I welcomed the discomfort, knowing that each drop
          represented progress.
        </p>
        <p>
          After several hours of relentless practice, I finally paused, my
          shirtless body coated in a sheen of sweat. I closed my eyes and
          focused on my breathing. Feeling my heart rate slow, I sat
          cross-legged on the ground and continued to focus on my breathing,
          grounding myself in the stillness of meditation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nitta Arata's Pain Killer, Nanami Kento's Ratio, Nishimiya Momo's Tool
          Manipulation, and Dagon's Disaster Tides were the four curse
          techniques I had managed to pull in the past two years, much to my
          dissatisfaction.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nitta Arata's Pain Killer allows its user to stop existing injuries
          from getting any worse. Arata can't heal wounds, but he can stop
          bleeding and reduce the pain for anyone he applies it to. However, any
          injuries sustained after the technique's application are unaffected.
        </p>
        <p>
          A rather useful technique for a supportive role. It'll help me
          continue a fight without having to worry about any life-threatening
          injuries.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nanami Kento's Ratio allows its user to use this technique to mark
          their target's body with lines divided into tenths. If the user is
          able to strike one of these lines on exactly the seven-to-three ratio
          point, they deliver a critical hit to the subject. This allows them to
          deal significant damage on tougher adversaries and cleave weak
          opponents in two in a single hit.
        </p>
        <p>
          If used properly, Ratio could be used to land critical hit after
          critical hit on an opponent. Not to mention the potential it had if
          combined with a Black Flash. It was exciting to think about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nishimiya Momo's Tool Manipulation allows its user to freely
          manipulate a sorcerer's broomstick or tool by levitating it
          telepathically. Among other magic broom-related skills, this technique
          grants the user the ability to levitate on the tool or create gusts of
          powerful wind imbued with CE.
        </p>
        <p>
          What can I say about this technique? I didn't plan on moving around
          with a broomstick, so this technique was useless unless I could figure
          something else out for it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, Dagon's Disaster Tides allows its user to manifest high
          volumes of water and control it using their CE. It is incredibly
          versatile, allowing for use in all ranges. It can be used as a water
          shield for close and mid-range and as a large, sweeping wave for
          long-range.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having another curse technique from one of the disaster curses was a
          great addition. While Dagon didn't have the opportunity to show off
          all he could do like Jogo, I knew that with enough training, I could
          push this technique to greater heights.
        </p>
        <p>Just imagine a gigantic roaring tsunami coming your way.</p>
        <p>Definitely a promising technique.</p>
        <p>
          Even with all these new additions to my evergrowing list of curse
          techniques, I was still unsatisfied.
        </p>
        <p>
          Having the Ten Shadows was not enough. I still needed the Limitless,
          Shrine, Star Rage, Sukuna's CE reserves, and the Six-Eyes. Not to
          mention, I haven't even gotten a single Domain Expansion as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hell, I'll even accept Takaba Fumihiko's Comedian or Mahito's Idle
          Transfiguration at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Actually, I wouldn't mind Mahito's technique. I forgot how crazy
          strong it was. One touch, and I win. Talk about overpowered.
        </p>

        <p>
          Why was I so unlucky that I hadn't gotten any of the techniques or
          passives I actually wanted? Damn you, gacha gods!
        </p>
        <p>
          For skills and passives, I was able to pull Kenjaku's Martial Arts
          skills, Ijichi Kiyotaka's Barrier skills, and Fushiguro Toji's
          Advanced Perception.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kenjaku's Martial Arts skills were a wonderful addition to my already
          impressive martial arts repertoire. It has greatly increased my
          hand-to-hand proficiency to even greater peaks. After all, a sorcerer
          who had lived a thousand-plus years has had a lot of time to learn
          almost every martial art ever created in his world.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ijichi Kiyotaka's Barrier skills were something I didn't know I needed
          until I had it. Barriers in the JJK world were used to conceal,
          contain, or deny entry to others within that space. Ijichi, in
          particular, was a rather skilled barrier user who was trusted highly
          by Gojo Satoru himself. The man proved himself an asset when he used a
          barrier to conceal Gojo's Hollow Technique: Purple during his opening
          attack on Sukuna.
        </p>
        <p>
          Fushiguro Toji's Advanced Perception had heightened my five senses to
          their absolute peak. It's what allowed Toji to see cursed spirits even
          without CE. Like Maki, there were only things he and she could
          <i>see </i>in the world. Changes in temperature and the shifts in
          density were things I could now <i>see </i>around me as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a seriously broken passive. I was thankful to have won it with
          that Diamond tier pull.
        </p>
        <p>
          All my other rewards were just more useless junk. I could essentially
          cosplay almost every character from JJK at this point.
        </p>
        <p>
          Still, I couldn't wait to wear the homeless, child-support dodging
          fit.
        </p>
        <p>"Gueh."</p>
        <p>
          I opened my eyes to see that it was now pitch black. I turned to Zaiko
          and then to the star-filled sky with a nervous expression.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Did I just meditate through the day again?" I sighed and rubbed my
          face. "Shit."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Gueh," Zaiko uttered and looked over at the two descending crows who
          quickly landed in front of me.
        </p>
        <p>
          (Boss! Boss!) Crow Yuji squeaked as he hopped onto my knee with Crow
          Nobara behind him. (We found that human!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Crow Nobara hobbed beside Crow Yuji and pecked him on his wing,
          causing him to squeak. (Gojo found the human, you dolt!)
        </p>
        <p>(Alright, alright. So mean...)</p>
        <p>
          "Good work, you two." I stood up and lifted my arms to unwind my stiff
          joints. I then began to go through some stretches. "Now then, let's go
          pick up a stray."
        </p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          The laboratory was dimly lit, with flickering fluorescent lights
          casting eerie shadows across the cold, sterile walls. The air was
          thick with an unsettling mix of chemical odors, a pungent reminder of
          the experiments conducted within. Rows of glass beakers and vials
          lined the cluttered countertops, some bubbling ominously with
          iridescent liquids while others were stained with dark,
          incomprehensible substances.
        </p>
        <p>
          In one corner, a large metal table stood, grimy and stained, adorned
          with surgical tools that glinted menacingly under the weak light.
          Charts and diagrams, filled with incomprehensible symbols, were pinned
          haphazardly to the walls, giving a sense of frantic research and
          obsession. A heavy metal door, slightly ajar, groaned occasionally as
          if it harbored secrets that it desperately tried to keep hidden.
        </p>

        <p>
          The faint sound of dripping water echoed in the background, punctuated
          by the unsettling hum of machinery that seemed to breathe with a life
          of its own. Shadows danced along the walls, sometimes resembling
          figures peering out from the corners, evoking a sense of dread and
          anticipation.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this place, the line between genius and madness was blurred, and
          one could almost feel the presence of unrestrained ambition and evil
          lingering in the air, whispering of dark experiments waiting to be
          unleashed.
        </p>
        <p>"Hmm... <i>Sukuna</i>. What an interesting fellow."</p>
        <p>
          Sitting behind a computer within the lab was a man dressed in a suit
          whose face was entirely made up of scar tissue, extending from above
          his upper lip and covering his entire head and the back of his neck.
          As such, he had no visible nose, ears, hair, or eyes, though the
          outlines of his eye sockets were visible. Attached to his face and
          neck were several life-sustaining tubes and wires that stabbed
          themselves into his skin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some would feel sorry for the sad state this man was in, but those who
          knew who he truly was would sooner run in terror.
        </p>
        <p>For this man was none other than <i>All For One</i>.</p>
        <p>
          Once Japan's most powerful villain. Unmatched by <strong>all</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          All, except for the Symbol of Peace himself, All Might. Who reduced
          him to the sad state he currently found himself in.
        </p>
        <p>
          A slow, intrigued smile grew on the disfigured man's face as he looked
          at the blurry image on his computer of a hooded figure with a long
          black and golden staff sitting over their shoulders as he seemingly
          flew through the air in a standing position as the moon hung in the
          starry sky.
        </p>
        <p>
          "A quirk that allows you to control your own blood, swap places with
          small objects, great strength, high speeds, flight, a form of
          telekinesis, the ability to conjure both fire and water, masterful
          martial arts, and high-level weapons knowledge, and who knows what
          more." All For One said with an evergrowing sinister smile. "You're
          like <i>me</i>."
        </p>
        <p>"How very interesting indeed."</p>
        <p>x x x</p>
        <p><strong>[General POV]</strong></p>
        <p>
          The paved streets glistened under the pale glow of the streetlamps,
          casting long shadows that flickered in the night breeze.
        </p>
        <p>
          Toga Himiko<i> </i>kept her distance, just enough to remain unseen but
          close enough to keep the drunk salaryman in her sights. The man moved
          back and forth, swaying around due to his inebriation; his coat flared
          slightly as he trekked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko was a fair-skinned girl with an attractive face. She had
          inward-tilting yellow eyes with thin, slit-like irises that resembled
          those of a cat. Her wide mouth had a somewhat feline appearance, as
          her canines were pointed and longer than her other teeth, giving her a
          vampiric look. Her loose, shoulder-length hair was a pale ash-blonde,
          and two chin-length side bangs framed her face.
        </p>

        <p>
          With each step, her heart raced. The streets were nearly empty except
          for the occasional rustle of leaves and the hum of late-night traffic.
          Himiko followed the man into a dimly lit, narrow alley, its walls
          adorned with peeling posters and fading graffiti. The scent of damp
          earth mingled with something spicy, perhaps leftover food from a
          nearby restaurant.
        </p>
        <p>
          He paused at a corner, glancing over his shoulder. For a fleeting
          moment, she held her breath, pressing herself against the cool brick
          wall to blend into the shadows. The man seemed to scan the area, and
          she wondered if he could feel her presence. Shrugging, the man
          unbuckled his pants and pulled out his member to release himself on
          the wall before him with a long, satisfied sigh.
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko's face grew into a wide, hungry smile as she gripped her dirty
          boxcutter tightly.
        </p>
        <p>The man's back was turned to her.</p>
        <p>This was her chance.</p>
        <p>
          She walked around the corner where she hid behind, her dirty school
          uniform matted with dirt and dried blood. Her loose, crusty hair
          swayed as she approached the man with a blaring hunger in her stomach.
          As she took one step, she felt her legs shake from exhaustion, causing
          her to briefly pause. The several sleepless nights Himiko had gone
          through were beginning to affect her.
        </p>
        <p>
          But that would change soon. Himiko would finally have a taste of the
          glorious, delicious, beautiful, life-sustaining blood again!
        </p>
        <p>She couldn't wait!</p>
        <p>
          Her dear Saito's blood was so delicious; she couldn't wait for another
          taste! Blood was all she could think about! Not even her painful
          hunger or thirsty throat could distract her right now.
        </p>
        <p>
          "Blood... j-just a little. Just a t-taste." Himiko muttered as she and
          the man were only three meters apart. "I'll just stab you a little
          bit. It'll only hurt for a second."
        </p>
        <p>
          "Are you sure you want to do that? Once you start down that path, you
          won't be able to stop."
        </p>
        <p>
          Himiko and the pissing man spun to look at a hooded figure leaning
          against one of the walls in the alleyway with their hands in their
          jacket pockets. Seemingly appearing out of thin air. The drunk man
          quickly buckled up his pants and turned back and forth to the hooded
          figure and Himiko.
        </p>
        <p>"W-what the hell?! Who the hell are you two?!"</p>
        <p>
          "Get lost, you bozo." The hooded figure shooed the man away. "And stop
          pissing in the streets. That's disgusting."
        </p>
        <p>"Huh?! Who the hell-"</p>
        <p><i>Shunk!</i></p>
        <p>
          Both Himiko and the man blinked in confusion as a thick knife stabbed
          itself beside the drunk man's head, silencing him.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeing the weapon, the man screamed in fright and ran out of the
          alleyway. Leaving the hooded individual and Himiko alone.
        </p>
        <p>Sukuna pushed himself off the wall and approached Toga.</p>
        <p>"Now then, Toga. Let's talk."</p>
