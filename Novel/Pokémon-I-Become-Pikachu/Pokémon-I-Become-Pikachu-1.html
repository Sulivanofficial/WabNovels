        <h2>Capítulo 1: -</h2>
        You sir!<br />At this moment, Muchen's heart was filled with grief and
        indignation.<br /><br />Others time travel, so do I.<br /><br />But the
        problem is, he either travels through the body directly, or even if the
        soul wears it, he is at least tall, rich and handsome, right?<br /><br />Even
        if we are not tall, rich and handsome, even if we are some kind of
        high-ranking yamen, don't we still have acquired development
        potential?<br /><br />But what about me?What kind of barren thing is
        this that Lao Tzu traveled through?<br />I Nima?<br />Looking at his
        golden hair, the lightning-shaped tail, and his pair of short furry
        hands, Mu Chen collapsed.<br /><br />"Pickup~~!"<br /><br />Skin your
        sister!<br /><br />The collapsed Mu Chen cursed loudly, but the voice
        that came out of his mouth was a slightly cute "pickup" voice.<br /><br />"Didi,
        the Skin God system is activated, and the host is successfully bound.<br /><br />The
        main mission starts, the road to the skin god.<br /><br />The goal of
        the mission is to help Ash Ketchum become the champion of the Kanto
        region.<br /><br />Task time limit, one year.<br /><br />Task reward,
        become a primary skin god.<br /><br />Failure punishment, obliteration.
        "<br /><br />Lying grass! ?What the hell?<br />Skin god system?<br /><br />What
        the hell did he just say?Help Ash Ketchum?Lying grass! ?I am that
        Pikachu! ?<br /><br />At this moment, Mu Chen already knew his identity
        in his heart.<br /><br />Feelings, how the hell did I actually
        transmigrate into Ash Ketchum's skinny body in the animation?<br />The
        issue is!So what about Skin God?I want to be a human being!<br />At this
        moment, tears streaming down his face are not enough to express the
        grief and indignation in Mu Chen's heart.<br /><br />As a senior DIAO
        silk otaku, he lost his human body, and even the joy of watching the art
        performances of those teachers will be completely lost.<br /><br />For
        Muchen, this is simply unimaginable!<br /><br />Is there any meaning to
        such a life?<br />"Doctor! Doctor! Sorry I'm late!"<br /><br />Just when
        Muchen doubted his life, suddenly a childish voice came from outside.<br /><br />At
        this moment, Mu Chen suddenly realized that he was actually in the elf
        ball.<br /><br />Damn, no wonder I said, why is this room so small?<br />"Ash
        Ketchum, you woke up too late! All the Pokémon have been chosen by
        others.<br /><br />Now, there is only this last Pokémon left, but it
        seems to have some problems. "<br /><br />Obviously, this is deducing
        everything completely according to the plot in the animation.<br /><br />"Hahaha!
        Pikachu, you will be my partner from now on!"<br /><br />At this moment,
        Muchen was very irritable.<br /><br />I'm such a straight man of
        steel!How dare you hug me, you sweaty brat?<br /><br />What else is
        there to say?It must be an electric shock.<br /><br />Although Muchen
        has just possessed Pikachu, this does not affect its ability to use its
        own skills.<br /><br />Just kidding, although this system issued tasks
        to Lao Tzu, it also allowed Lao Tzu to see his own data panel, right?<br /><br />Although
        that poor attribute made Mu Chen not interested in paying attention, Mu
        Chen still noticed the solitary electric shock on his skill panel.<br /><br />"Fuck!"<br /><br />An
        electric current flashed, and Ash Ketchum and Professor Oak changed into
        Shamat hairstyles without any accident.<br /><br />Nima!Lao Tzu is
        really a weak B!<br /><br />Seeing that an electric shock only changed
        someone's hairstyle, Muchen's heart was filled with grief and
        indignation.<br /><br />At this level, how to complete the main task?<br /><br />The
        price of failure is obliteration!<br />Although it is unacceptable to
        become this yellow-skinned mouse, but what, it is much better than going
        back to come directly, right?<br /><br />"Pikachu, let's go, I'll take
        you to meet my mother Delia Ketchum, and then we're leaving!"<br /><br />For
        the grief and indignation in Mu Chen's heart, Xiao Zhi naturally didn't
        know anything about it.<br /><br />At this moment, this guy is in a
        state of excitement for becoming the trainer of the alliance.<br /><br />"Ah!
        Ash Ketchum, is this the elf you received from the doctor?"<br /><br />Not
        caring about the change of her son's hairstyle, Delia Ketchum's gaze was
        completely on that listless Pikachu.<br /><br />Who! ?<br /><br />correct!This
        guy just said he was going to see his mother, Delia Ketchum?<br /><br />Attracted
        by the woman's voice, Muchen raised his drooping eyelids slightly.<br /><br />Seeing
        this, Mu Chen was excited!<br /><br />This shit!This is Ash Ketchum's
        mother?Are you kidding me?<br />What appeared in front of Muchen was a
        beautiful woman in her thirties.<br /><br />"Ash Ketchum, it seems that
        your Pikachu likes me more~"<br /><br />Seeing that Pikachu regained his
        energy because of his appearance, Delia Ketchum suddenly became
        interested.<br /><br />"Ah! Mom, this little thing will shock people, be
        careful!"<br /><br />Seeing that his mother wanted to take Pikachu from
        his shoulder, Ash Ketchum suddenly became nervous.<br /><br />It doesn't
        matter if I get electrocuted, Professor Oak deserves to be electrocuted,
        and if my mother is also electrocuted, it will be a real crime.<br /><br />"Hehehe~
        No, look, how much does this little thing like mom?<br /><br />ah!Don't
        move! "<br /><br />Picking up Pikachu, Delia Ketchum immediately hugged
        him into her arms.<br /><br />At this moment, Mu Chen suddenly felt that
        it would be nice to become a yellow-skinned mouse!<br /><br />If it was
        human, which woman would hug you for no reason?<br /><br />Now that I
        have become this cute-looking Pikachu, I can be liked by these lovely
        young ladies.<br /><br />Is this a windfall?<br />"Okay, Ash Ketchum, it
        seems that your Pikachu is still very energetic.<br /><br />Then, my
        dear son, mother blesses you, achieve your wish as soon as possible and
        become the champion of the league!<br /><br />And you, Pikachu, must
        help my son, you must make progress together~"<br /><br />The reddish
        Delia Ketchum took away Pikachu who was still fidgeting, and gave Ash
        Ketchum some motherly encouragement.<br /><br />"Don't worry! Mom, with
        Pikachu's help, I will definitely become the league champion and the
        most powerful trainer!"<br /><br />Ash Ketchum, who is ignorant and
        ignorant, obviously still doesn't understand what is happening in front
        of him.<br /><br />At this moment, his young heart is full of longing
        for the future journey.<br /><br />Of course, at this time, there is
        still one person who is very unhappy.<br /><br />That person is
        naturally our poor Muchen.<br /><br />I am Nima!How dare you take me
        away in such a second at night!<br />Being carried away suddenly,
        Muchen's heart was full of unwillingness.<br /><br />However, Huazi
        obviously didn't give Muchen this chance.<br /><br />Arms can't twist
        thighs, how could Mu Chen's small body be able to resist humans?<br /><br />Seeing
        her son drifting away and Pikachu listless again, Delia Ketchum was full
        of doubts.<br /><br />Where did Professor Oak get such a superb
        thing?<br />Of course, at this moment, Professor Oak doesn't have the
        energy to answer Delia Ketchum's question.<br /><br />You know, after
        being rewarded with a shock by Pikachu, Professor Oak was busy re-doing
        his hair.<br /><br />Just kidding, as a well-known figure in the Kanto
        region, I can't afford to lose this old man!

        <h2>Capítulo 2: -</h2>
        "Fight, Pikachu, use electric shock to knock down this green
        caterpillar!"<br /><br />I'll call you Nima!<br /><br />Hearing Ash
        Ketchum's idiot-like command, Mu Chen kept complaining in his heart.<br /><br />Ma
        De, it's about to hit the base, I hate it!<br />why!Why is it so
        unfair?<br /><br />I want to change my trainer!Delia Ketchum!I want you
        to be my trainer!<br />Even if it's not Delia Ketchum, what kind of
        beauty, chestnut's female creature is fine!<br /><br />I really don't
        want to travel with this idiot!<br /><br />"Pikachu? Use an electric
        shock! What's wrong with you? The green caterpillar is about to
        escape!"<br /><br />Obviously, Ash Ketchum didn't know anything about
        what Mu Chen was thinking.<br /><br />At this moment, Ash Ketchum's eyes
        are completely on the green caterpillar wriggling in front of him.<br /><br />if
        only!As long as Pikachuken gave him such a gentle electric shock, I
        could capture him!<br />This, but the first elf I met in the wild!<br />However,
        what Mu Chen misses at this moment is Huazi's warm embrace.<br /><br />For
        Ash Ketchum's request, Mu Chen selectively ignored it.<br /><br />Just
        kidding, I have this kung fu, why not remember the "sexual blessing"
        experience just now.<br /><br />"Didi, the random mission is on.<br /><br />Help
        Ash Ketchum get rid of the attack of the Beedrill swarm.<br /><br />Task
        rewards, skills acquired, lightning flashes. "<br /><br />Water! ?<br />What
        to do! ?<br /><br />Mu Chen was stunned when he heard the electronic
        sound suddenly coming from the system.<br /><br />This shit?random
        mission?Let me help that idiot! ?<br />But the reward skills seem to be
        pretty good, right?<br />Lightning flash?Is that the extremely fast
        sprint skill?<br />Groove!This is a good skill!If I knew this trick
        before, how could I miss the chance to get on base?<br /><br />At this
        moment, Mu Chen cheered up again.<br /><br />It is not terrible to miss
        that opportunity!<br />When I have learned this skill, I have nothing to
        say, as long as I encounter this kind of opportunity, I will decisively
        use it with a flash of lightning, and I will not be able to hit the base
        if I don't believe it!<br /><br />However, what did the system say just
        now?<br /><br />Help Ash Ketchum get rid of the attack of the
        Beedrill?Nima?Isn't it a green caterpillar?Why did you upgrade?<br />Apparently,
        Muchen, who was trapped in his own world, didn't realize it, because of
        his lack of cooperation, Ash Ketchum had already chosen to capture the
        green caterpillar by himself.<br /><br />But I never thought that this
        elf ball was lost and slightly crooked.<br /><br />Of course, it's fine
        if it's missing.<br /><br />But the problem is, this elf ball was
        accidentally thrown on a Kakuna.<br /><br />A Kakuna is not a green
        caterpillar.<br /><br />This guy is a very combative existence.<br /><br />Without
        a fight, the Poké Ball naturally cannot capture it.<br /><br />Breaking
        out of the poke ball, the Kakuna didn't choose to attack Ash Ketchum
        directly, but raised its head and let out bursts of insect chirping.<br /><br />immediately<br />"Buzz!"<br /><br />The
        sky-shaking sound of insects came.<br /><br />Apparently, the Kakuna
        used its ult, calling for reinforcements.<br /><br />At the same time,
        Mu Chen also came to Ash Ketchum's side under the prompt of the
        system.<br /><br />"Pikachu, what happened to you just now? Is there
        something uncomfortable? Are you hungry?"<br /><br />Obviously, the pure
        Ash still doesn't know the reason for Pikachu's previous strike.<br /><br />"Pickup~!"<br /><br />He
        let out a feeble cry, which was a response to Ash Ketchum.<br /><br />At
        this moment, Muchen's full attention is on the system task.<br /><br />Nima?Beedrill?Where
        should the game be?<br />Eager to complete the task and get the reward
        directly, Mu Chen has already sharpened his sword, ready to send a
        powerful electric shock attack to the Beedrill that has not yet
        appeared.<br /><br />But as the sound of "buzzing" approached, Mu Chen
        suddenly had a bad feeling.<br /><br />Nima!Why do I feel gloomy?<br /><br />The
        Beedrill seems to be the ultimate evolution of the Kakuna, right?<br />If
        you are singled out, can I win?Probably, should, okay?<br />Obviously,
        Mu Chen only paid attention to the task rewards given by the system, but
        he ignored the word "group" behind the Beedrill.<br /><br />"No!
        Pikachu, run!"<br /><br />As the saying goes, stand tall and see far.<br /><br />No
        matter how bad Ash Ketchum is, he is still a boy in his teens, much
        taller than Mu Chen's poor Pikachu.<br /><br />Before Muchen found the
        enemy, Ash Ketchum saw the swarm of Beedrills madly attacking him at the
        end of his field of vision.<br /><br />"Pickup~!"<br /><br />Hearing Ash
        Ketchum's words, Muchen immediately put on a fighting POSS.<br /><br />But
        before he could fully enter the state, he suddenly reacted.<br /><br />and
        many more!<br /><br />This idiot, what did you just say?<br />run?Shouldn't
        I let Lao Tzu rush up to fight?<br /><br />Puzzled, Muchen stood on
        tiptoe again and looked forward.<br /><br />at last!<br /><br />Muchen
        also found the swarm of Beedrills attacking madly.<br /><br />I XX you
        OO!<br /><br />Finally seeing the target, Mu Chen only had two words of
        cursing in his heart.<br /><br />This shit!Dozens of Beedrills, why did
        you ask me to protect Ash Ketchum?<br /><br />Go to your uncle!<br /><br />Even
        a Beedrill, Muchen, doesn't have the courage to fight against it, let
        alone a group of them?<br /><br />What else is there to say, let's
        go!<br /><br />Ignoring Ash Ketchum who was turning around in
        embarrassment, Mu Chen turned his body around with an extremely elegant
        movement, his four claws flew wildly, and ran forward desperately.<br /><br />I
        love so and so, I won't serve you anymore!<br /><br />However, how can
        one run so fast?<br />Before Mu Chen and Ash Ketchum ran far, they were
        overtaken by a swarm of angry bees.<br /><br />"Buzz!"<br /><br />Without
        further ado, the angry swarm of Beedrills used their favorite skill,
        double needle.<br /><br />Lying grass!It hurts!<br />Unfortunately, he
        was shot in the butt, and Mu Chen even accelerated his escape.<br /><br />"Crash!"<br /><br />Fortunately,
        just as Mu Chen and Xiao Zhi were covered in bruises from the bite, the
        heavens were beautiful, and a green rain suddenly fell.<br /><br />For
        the Beedrill who hates rain, how can attacking the enemy be as important
        as avoiding the rain?<br />"Buzz!"<br /><br />The swarm of bees
        gradually dispersed, and Mu Chen, who was safe, no longer had the
        strength to run.<br /><br />Nima!I was an otaku in my previous life,
        when did I suffer from this crime?<br />"Pikachu! Pikachu! What's wrong
        with you? Hold on! Pikachu!"<br /><br />Ash Ketchum deserves to be the
        existence who can become Master Zhi in the future, and his physical
        strength and ability to resist attacks must have reached full value.<br /><br />Muchen
        couldn't hold on any longer, on the contrary, Ash Ketchum was still
        acting like a normal person.<br /><br />Seeing Muchen fell in the rain,
        Ash Ketchum nervously picked him up, and frantically ran all the way to
        Changpan City, which is the closest to here.<br /><br />I will go to
        your uncle!I don't want to be hugged by men!It smells like sweat, help
        me!<br /><br />Although he didn't have to travel by himself, this
        experience was not beautiful to Muchen.<br /><br />"Pickup~!"<br /><br />However,
        his protest was just an inaudible cry.<br />
        <p></p>

        <h2>Capítulo 3: -</h2>

        "Asshole! Give me back my bicycle!"<br /><br />Due to too much physical
        exertion, Muchen finally fell into a coma.<br /><br />When he regained
        consciousness, he suddenly heard a female voice.<br /><br />woman!<br /><br />Hearing
        the voice of the opposite sex, Muchen suddenly recovered.<br /><br />Turning
        his head to look, he realized that he had been placed in the hurdle of a
        bicycle without knowing when.<br /><br />And behind him, a girl is
        chasing the "car thief" Ash Ketchum crazily.<br /><br />nice!<br />Looking
        at the girl's delicate face and well-proportioned figure, Mu Chen's
        originally sluggish spirit recovered.<br /><br />idiot!Why don't you
        ride so fast!Didn't you see that young lady is going to be unable to
        catch up?<br />Tired young lady, you don't feel sorry for me!<br />"Pika~Chu~!"<br /><br />However,
        after Muchen's protest, it was this cute cry that could melt people's
        hearts.<br /><br />"Pikachu, are you awake? Hold on, we're about to
        reach Pallet Town! As long as you get there, you can get Miss Joey's
        treatment!"<br /><br />Walter?<br /><br />Nurse Joy! ?<br />Muchen, who
        was about to ignore this idiot's words, suddenly regained his
        spirits.<br /><br />yes!Dad, I am in the world of Pokemon!<br /><br />There
        are all kinds of girls in this world!<br /><br />For example, what the
        idiot said just now, Nurse Joy!<br />No, I can't come to my senses,
        otherwise, would this idiot send me to see Nurse Joy?<br />Thinking of
        this, Muchen quickly forced himself to extinguish the restless little
        flame in his heart.<br /><br />At this moment, it's not the time for me
        to explode!<br />"Okay, hold on, we're in Pallet Town!"<br /><br />Finally,
        while Mu Chen waited bitterly, Ash Ketchum uttered the most satisfying
        sentence so far.<br /><br />"Bastard! Thief! Robber! My bicycle!"<br /><br />Chasing
        all the way, the girl with amazing physical strength followed closely
        behind, and followed Ash Ketchum to Pallet Town.<br /><br />"Young man,
        please show your ID.<br /><br />The lady just said that you stole her
        bicycle?Is it this one?what happened? "<br /><br />Before Ash Ketchum
        could explain, a clear female voice came over.<br /><br />Attracted by
        the female voice, Mu Chen, who pretended to be unconscious, slightly
        raised his closed eyelids.<br /><br />Seeing this, Mu Chen jumped up
        from Ash Ketchum's arms almost excitedly.<br /><br />Nima!uniform!<br /><br />no
        more!I can't do it anymore!<br /><br />When Mu Chen saw this beautiful
        woman in uniform who appeared in front of him, he fell into a trap.<br /><br />Thinking
        that Mu Chen was just a dead house dick, how had he ever seen such an
        outstanding beauty in uniform with his own eyes?<br />At this moment, Mu
        Chen realized that the uniforms played by various teachers he had seen
        before were not on the same level as this beauty.<br /><br />"Oh!
        Officer Jenny!<br />Well, my Pikachu got hurt and I borrowed the bike
        because it was an emergency.<br /><br />Now the bicycle is returned to
        you, sorry. "<br /><br />Officer Jenny is an official who maintains law
        and order. Seeing her appear, Ash Ketchum explained repeatedly.<br /><br />!!!<br /><br />This
        is Officer Jenny! ?<br />No wonder!No wonder!<br /><br />Hearing Ash
        Ketchum's voice, Mu Chen finally knew who the beauty who made him fall
        was.<br /><br />ah!system!Lao Tzu, I am so grateful to your eight
        generations of ancestors!<br /><br />At this moment, Muchen's heart was
        full of gratitude to the system.<br /><br />If it wasn't for the system
        guy, how could I have traveled to such a wonderful world?<br /><br />Even
        at this moment, Muchen is full of joy at the fact that he is a Pikachu
        instead of a human.<br /><br />Just kidding, I have such a cute
        appearance, don't these young ladies take advantage of it casually?<br />"Well,
        your Pikachu seems to be seriously injured, and has fallen into a
        sluggish state, so hurry up and send it to Miss Joey.<br /><br />This
        time it happened for a reason, so forget it.<br /><br />If there are
        similar behaviors in the future, be careful that I am rude to you! "<br /><br />Of
        course Officer Jenny didn't know what Mu Chen was thinking.<br /><br />Seeing
        this Pikachu's eyes were dull, his mouth was wide open, and he didn't
        even know that saliva was flowing down his mouth.<br /><br />Miss Jun
        Sha decisively judged that this Pokémon had fallen into a near-death
        state.<br /><br />With Officer Jenny's understanding, Ash Ketchum is
        naturally very grateful.<br /><br />After bidding farewell to Officer
        Jenny, Ash Ketchum followed the route she gave and ran towards the elf
        center where Miss Joey was.<br /><br />As for Muchen?<br />This guy is
        obviously still stuck in his own happy little world.<br /><br />"Ah!
        Trainer, how could your Pokmon be injured to such an extent?<br />This,
        this has completely entered a state of sluggishness, how can you treat
        your Pokémon like this? "<br /><br />When Muchen regained consciousness
        again, what he heard in his ears was Nurse Joy's slightly reproachful
        questioning voice.<br /><br />Nima!This little movement is so sweet!<br />Awakened
        by Nurse Joy's voice, Muchen regained his vitality again.<br /><br />When
        he turned his head to look, this guy was dumbfounded again.<br /><br />Nima!uniform!Uniforms
        again!<br /><br />Don't be so exciting!<br /><br />There was a uniform
        just now, and now there is another uniform!<br />However, this Nurse Joy
        with this uniform is completely different from the Yujie Junsha just
        now!<br />Not bad, not bad, I like this old man too!<br /><br />When
        Muchen was hugged by the sweet Nurse Joy, he was already so excited that
        he couldn't control himself.<br /><br />The slightly trembling body made
        Ms. Joy think that it was caused by her serious injuries.<br /><br />"Blissey,
        I will leave this little guy to you, you must make it recover~"<br /><br />Before
        Muchen could make a move, Nurse Joy handed it over to a huge egg-shaped
        Pokémon.<br /><br />"lucky~~"<br /><br />Skillfully took over Muchen
        from Ms. Joy's hand, Blissey immediately entered the working state.<br /><br />I
        am Nima!Young lady?How did you abandon me?<br />I don't want this fat
        and fat idiot to treat me!What I need is you, Lao Tzu!<br /><br />Under
        Muchen's desperate eyes, Nurse Joy gradually moved away from its
        sight.<br /><br />"Crack!"<br /><br />Just when Muchen was about to
        break free from Blissey's arms, this guy had already come in front of
        the recovery machine, ignored Muchen's reaction, and placed it directly
        in the machine.<br /><br />Nima!My little sister!<br />Under Muchen's
        unwilling eyes, the Blissey turned its bloated body around, and started
        the machine with a dazzling operation.<br /><br />"Hoo! Hoo!"<br /><br />The
        hypnotic mist that helped the elves fall asleep was blown out from the
        sealed machine, and Muchen fell into a coma without any resistance.<br /><br />Fuck!I
        just remembered, did I finish the random task before?<br /><br />This
        was Mu Chen's last thought before falling into a coma.<br />
        <p></p>

        <h2>Capítulo 4: -</h2>

        "Pika~Chu!"<br /><br />Unexplainably, he was healed, and Mu Chen, who
        was sent back to Ash Ketchum, uttered a cry of lovelessness.<br /><br />Nima!After
        all the hard work, I didn't even touch Nurse Joy's hand?<br />Thinking
        that he was in that fat man's embrace the whole time before, Muchen's
        tears couldn't stop flowing down.<br /><br />fraud!What the fuck is a
        liar!What about Miss?<br />If I had known that this guy was here to
        treat Lao Tzu, why the hell would I pretend to be in a coma?<br />"Wow!
        This is your elf! It really is full of vitality.<br /><br />However,
        even if this is the case, you must compensate my bicycle! "<br /><br />When
        the girl's voice came, Mu Chen realized that the girl who had been
        chasing the two before was also beside his master, Xiao Zhi.<br /><br />Looking
        at this girl who is not yet fully developed, but already has a pair of
        fit and long legs, Mu Chen is full of interest.<br /><br />This one,
        could it be that Misty in the animation?<br /><br />Although Muchen
        doesn't know much about the Pokémon world, he has heard of this heroine
        to some extent.<br /><br />pity!such a pity!<br /><br />This one, it
        would be great if he could be a few years older.<br /><br />This is the
        only thought in Mu Chen's mind at the moment.<br /><br />I can't bear
        the underage lolita~<br />Why?wrong! ?Why did I float?<br /><br />Just
        when Muchen was still regretting how much younger this girl who was
        suspected to be Misty was, he suddenly realized that he had been lifted
        into the sky in a foolish way?<br />what's the situation! ?<br /><br />"Hey,
        it's cute, right? This, it's my first elf~!<br /><br />As for your
        bicycle. Don't worry!I will definitely make it up to you. "<br /><br />Lying
        grass!This idiot, why did he hug me again! ?<br />Being hugged by Ash
        Ketchum is one of the things Mu Chen extremely dislikes.<br /><br />Just
        kidding, I am a pure man, how can I be hugged by this sweaty man?<br /><br />This,
        what else is there to say, I will shock you away.<br /><br />"Zi
        La~!"<br /><br />Electricity flashed.<br /><br />"Um, are you okay?"<br /><br />Seeing
        Xiao Zhi who had transformed into a Shamat boy again, Xiao Xia suddenly
        began to wonder, where did this Pikachu get stolen from?<br /><br />"Ah?
        Hahaha! It's okay! It's okay! This is a way to enhance our
        relationship."<br /><br />To be able to become the existence of Zhiye in
        the future, his way of thinking must be different from ordinary
        people.<br /><br />Ignoring the two people who were talking, Muchen put
        his mind on the system.<br /><br />Nima, what's the matter?<br /><br />I
        should have completed the random task before, right?Why is there no
        reaction at all?<br />"The system is being upgraded, and the rewards are
        delayed."<br /><br />Amidst Mu Chen's calls, the damn system finally
        gave him a response.<br /><br />However, the content of this response
        made it unacceptable.<br /><br />System Upgrade?What's the matter with
        Nima?<br /><br />Dad, I just traveled over here, right?<br />Why did you
        upgrade just now?What kind of system do you have?<br /><br />"In view of
        the host's special hobbies, the company has made some adjustments to the
        system's functions. Please wait patiently and wish you a pleasant
        use."<br /><br />Water! ?<br />In view of Lao Tzu's special hobbies?<br />This
        shit?Dad, what are my hobbies?Why don't I know?<br />If you are male and
        you like female, how do you adjust this?Do you want me to switch with
        this idiot, so I can't restore my human body?<br /><br />Lying
        grass!No!How can a human body get into Miss Sister's arms?Wouldn't he be
        beaten to death?<br />At this moment, Muchen panicked.<br /><br />Before
        that, he still rejected his own body, but since the Huazi incident,
        Muchen is very satisfied with this body.<br /><br />Just kidding, you
        can get into people's arms by showing off your cuteness, where can you
        find such a good job?<br />"Are you planning to go to the gymnasium in
        Nibi City to challenge?<br />That's just right, my home is in Hualan
        City, which is behind Nibi City, and we happened to drop by.<br /><br />However,
        I can tell you that you must compensate for my bicycle! "<br /><br />At
        this moment, the girl's voice came again, which made Mu Chen completely
        confirm the guess in his heart.<br /><br />This loli with long legs is
        Misty!<br /><br />Fortunately, fortunately, the plot is still developing
        normally!<br />After confirming that this girl is Misty, Mu Chen's
        uneasy heart calmed down.<br /><br />At the very least, when I travel,
        there are always beauties by my side, right?<br />Although she is a
        loli, but her long legs are also very good~<br />Besides, after
        confirming Misty, Muchen can confirm the existence of another person.<br /><br />She
        is Team Rocket's Jessie!<br /><br />Misty is nothing to look at as a
        loli, but Jessie is an out-and-out Yujie.<br /><br />Thinking of
        Jessie's fiery red hair and hot figure, Muchen became excited.<br /><br />adventure
        eh?I am coming!<br />Filled with expectations and motivation for the
        future again, Muchen finally got rid of the listless state before.<br /><br />However,
        the reality is cruel, and things often backfire.<br /><br />"Let's go,
        Pikachu!"<br /><br />Under Ash Ketchum's idiot-like command, Mu Chen
        looked at the enemy in front of him, Pidgey, with a look of grief and
        indignation.<br /><br />Damn, I am still a cub, my skill is only an
        electric shock!<br /><br />Why did you choose such a high-end opponent
        for me in the first battle?I am not the skin god in the cartoon!<br />"Beep~beep~~"<br /><br />However,
        the angry Pidgey would not pay attention to what Mu Chen was
        thinking.<br /><br />For this existence that dared to violate its own
        territory, and even threw it with a poke ball, Pidgey was absolutely
        intolerable.<br /><br />This is a naked provocation to it.<br /><br />"Pikachu,
        use electromagnetic waves to interfere with Bibi's flight speed!"<br /><br />Under
        normal circumstances, an elf like Pikachu, even a cub, can completely
        master the basic skills of electromagnetic waves.<br /><br />But
        unfortunately, Muchen is an abnormal existence.<br /><br />"Oh, Pikachu,
        besides electric shock, what skills do you have?"<br /><br />Looking at
        Pikachu with a helpless face, Ash Ketchum, as a trainer, was also
        confused.<br /><br />why?Isn't that how it is introduced in the Pokémon
        Illustrated Book?Why can't my Pikachu know anything but electric
        people?<br />Nima, the system has been maintained, and I don't give me
        skills. Is there anything I can do?<br />Spreading his hands helplessly
        at Ash Ketchum, Mu Chen once again focused on the battle with a face
        full of grief and indignation.<br /><br />If you want to show off your
        cute diamond collar, you have to pay a corresponding price.<br /><br />In
        this world, with his elf ball in the hands of that idiot, Mu Chen really
        has no way to resist.<br /><br />"Pika~Chu!"<br /><br />Isn't it just a
        Pidgey?<br />bring it on!I am not afraid of you, Lao Tzu!<br /><br />A
        cry to boost his morale came out, and Muchen used his only skill,
        electric shock.<br />
        <p></p>

        <h2>Capítulo 5: -</h2>

        Nima!This is not a human job at all!<br />Muchen found out with grief
        and indignation that in reality, elf battles are not at all like in
        games.<br /><br />What the hell!Why can't I hit that big bird with my
        electric shock?<br /><br />How dare you stop?Do you dare to call me?<br /><br />Facing
        this unusually flexible Pidgey, even though Mu Chen had tried his best,
        lightning flashed all over the sky.<br /><br />However, its only
        function is to create this effect like fireworks, but it can't hit the
        target at all.<br /><br />"Beep~beep~!"<br /><br />After being entangled
        for a few times and bypassing all of Mu Chen's electric shock attacks,
        Pidgey changed the direction of flight with an extremely elegant flip,
        and shot towards Mu Chen, who was blushing below, as if he was
        constipated.<br /><br />Therefore, it is one of the flying elf's proud
        skills, the turning attack.<br /><br />"Pikachu! Be careful!"<br /><br />Now,
        through this battle, Ash Ketchum has discovered that his Pikachu seems
        to only know the electric shock skill.<br /><br />However, this is his
        original elf, his travel companion, Ash Ketchum will not abandon it
        naturally.<br /><br />After seeing Pidgey launch a counterattack, Ash
        Ketchum quickly called out loudly, reminding Mu Chen to be careful of
        the attack from the sky.<br /><br />"Pickup~!"<br /><br />Although
        Muchen also noticed Pidgey's attack, but relying on its short legs, how
        could it outrun Pidgey who is good at flying?<br />A painful cry came
        from Pikachu's mouth.<br /><br />Of course, this is the voice Ash
        Ketchum and Misty heard.<br /><br />Actually.<br />I x you uncle!It
        hurts so much!help!I don't want to play anymore!I won't drill the collar
        of Miss Sister anymore!Master System, let me turn back into a human!<br />At
        this moment, Mu Chen suddenly realized that his old house life was more
        suitable for him.<br /><br />This kind of life-threatening work, he is
        not suitable for me at all!<br />"Beep~beep~!"<br /><br />Of course
        Pidgey didn't know what Mu Chen was thinking.<br /><br />Seeing that his
        blow worked, Pidgey was even more refreshed.<br /><br />You know, before
        facing Pikachu, Pidgey still had a certain sense of nervousness.<br /><br />Anyway,
        this is also an elf whose attributes can restrain it.<br /><br />In the
        end, when they really fought against each other, Pidgey realized that
        this was a weak chicken at all.<br /><br />The skill only has a single
        electric shock, and it can only be used indiscriminately.<br /><br />Of
        course, Pidgey would not let go of the opportunity to abuse food like
        this.<br /><br />I saw him turn around again in the air, and kill the
        embarrassed Mu Chen again.<br /><br />"Ash Ketchum! Your Pikachu can't
        hold on anymore, do you want me to help you?"<br /><br />Seeing how
        desolate Pikachu was under Pidgey's attack, Misty couldn't stand it
        anymore.<br /><br />This isn't fighting at all, is it?Is this all Bibi
        Niao's unilateral abuse of food?<br />"No! I believe my partner, Pikachu
        will definitely win!"<br /><br />Master Zhi is Master Zhi.<br /><br />This
        kind of self-confidence is something most people will never have.<br /><br />Of
        course, the embarrassed Mu Chen didn't hear these words, otherwise this
        guy would definitely scold his mother again.<br /><br />You are so
        confident, why don't you come up and try it yourself?<br /><br />"Pickup!!!"<br /><br />The
        painful cry came again.<br /><br />This time, Muchen was completely
        angry.<br /><br />I x you uncle!I can bear you so much that you abuse
        me.<br /><br />How dare you peck Lao Tzu's chrysanthemum with your beak!
        ?<br /><br />During the embarrassing escape before, Mu Chen was
        unfortunately pecked by Pidgey.<br /><br />Normally, the damage of this
        skill is not as high as the turn attack, and Mu Chen can still bear
        it.<br /><br />but!It was a coincidence that this peck hit the backyard
        of Muchen who was running away.<br /><br />This really made Mu Chen
        intolerable.<br /><br />Embarrassed and angry, Muchen no longer ran
        away.<br /><br />Looking at Pidgey who turned back again, Muchen
        transformed all the shame and resentment in his heart into
        electricity.<br /><br />"Pika~Chu~!"<br /><br />A roar.<br /><br />An
        electric current that was much thicker than before condensed from Mu
        Chen's cheeks, and then shot out towards the oncoming Pidgey.<br /><br />"Beep~!"<br /><br />Seeing
        this finger-thick electric current, Pidgey was startled.<br /><br />However,
        the momentum has already started, how could it be so easy to adjust the
        body shape?<br />"Zi La~!"<br /><br />The electric current carried Mu
        Chen's expectation, and shot fiercely on Pidgey's body.<br /><br />"Beep!!!"<br /><br />This
        time, the painful chirping sound finally changed its master.<br /><br />Looking
        at Pidgey who was knocked down by his electric shock, Mu Chen still
        couldn't let go of his hatred, and released another electric shock to
        the opponent who was lying on the ground and twitching continuously.<br /><br />Nima!Let
        you f-ck show off with me, let you f-ck play with me and me.<br /><br />Are
        you showing off?Are you hiding?Don't you love popping
        chrysanthemums?keep going!<br />"Pickup~!"<br /><br />Of course, when
        these words reached Ash Ketchum's ears, it was Pikachu celebrating his
        victory.<br /><br />"Hahaha! Pikachu, great job! I knew you would do
        it!<br /><br />Well, don't charge it anymore, it will die if you
        continue to charge it!<br />Let me subdue it! "<br /><br />Seeing that
        Pikachu had defeated Pidgey, Xiao Zhi shouted excitedly.<br /><br />However,
        when he turned his attention to Pidgey again, he realized this.<br /><br />Pidgey
        had been electrocuted by the angry Pikachu until his whole body was
        scorched black, and even his convulsions had gradually ceased.<br /><br />Obviously,
        if the power goes on, Pidgey is afraid that it will directly become a
        roast chicken.<br /><br />How could Ash Ketchum, who wanted to subdue
        the Pokémon, let go of this Pidgey that he "personally" defeated?<br />Therefore,
        this guy hurriedly made a noise to stop Pikachu who was still releasing
        electric shocks.<br /><br />"Pika~Chu~!"<br /><br />Muchen's response to
        Ash Ketchum was to release another electric shock attack.<br /><br />stop?joke!<br /><br />This
        guy exploded my chrysanthemum, you tell me to stop?<br />Muchen swears,
        since he was born, until he died in the house for several years later,
        he has never suffered such a huge humiliation!<br /><br />But just when
        he was about to make persistent efforts to turn this hateful Pidgey into
        a roast chicken, an electronic sound suddenly came from his ears.<br /><br />"The
        system upgrade is complete, and version 2.0 of the Skin God system is
        activated.<br /><br />The new version opens the intrusion mode, please
        experience it.<br /><br />Random mission rewards, please check. "<br /><br />Water!
        ?<br />Upgraded successfully?<br />Hearing the electronic sound from the
        system, Mu Chen was taken aback for a moment.<br /><br />Damn, how long
        did it take for you to level up, Lao Tzu? It turned out so fast?<br /><br />However,
        what the hell is this random entry mode?What about version 2.0?What are
        you doing with me?<br />There were many questions in his head, but the
        system did not give Mu Chen the slightest answer.<br /><br />And just
        when Mu Chen was in a daze, Xiao Zhi decisively threw the elf ball that
        had been prepared.<br /><br />"Pidgey, I've subdued you!"<br /><br />Picking
        up the Poké Ball that was subdued without any resistance at all, Ash
        Ketchum yelled out his classic lines.<br />
