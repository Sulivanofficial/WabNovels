        <h2>Chapter 1: -</h2>

        You sir!<br />At this moment, Muchen's heart was filled with grief and
        indignation.<br />Others time travel, so do I.<br />But the problem is,
        he either travels through the body directly, or even if the soul wears
        it, he is at least tall, rich and handsome, right?<br />Even if we are
        not tall, rich and handsome, even if we are some kind of high-ranking
        yamen, don't we still have acquired development potential?<br />But what
        about me?What kind of barren thing is this that Lao Tzu traveled
        through?<br />I Nima?<br />Looking at his golden hair, the
        lightning-shaped tail, and his pair of short furry hands, Mu Chen
        collapsed.<br />"Pickup~~!"<br />Skin your sister!<br />The collapsed Mu
        Chen cursed loudly, but the voice that came out of his mouth was a
        slightly cute "pickup" voice.<br />"Didi, the Skin God system is
        activated, and the host is successfully bound.<br />The main mission
        starts, the road to the skin god.<br />The goal of the mission is to
        help Ash Ketchum become the champion of the Kanto region.<br />Task time
        limit, one year.<br />Task reward, become a primary skin god.<br />Failure
        punishment, obliteration. "<br />Lying grass! ?What the hell?<br />Skin
        god system?<br />What the hell did he just say?Help Ash Ketchum?Lying
        grass! ?I am that Pikachu! ?<br />At this moment, Mu Chen already knew
        his identity in his heart.<br />Feelings, how the hell did I actually
        transmigrate into Ash Ketchum's skinny body in the animation?<br />The
        issue is!So what about Skin God?I want to be a human being!<br />At this
        moment, tears streaming down his face are not enough to express the
        grief and indignation in Mu Chen's heart.<br />As a senior DIAO silk
        otaku, he lost his human body, and even the joy of watching the art
        performances of those teachers will be completely lost.<br />For Muchen,
        this is simply unimaginable!<br />Is there any meaning to such a
        life?<br />"Doctor! Doctor! Sorry I'm late!"<br />Just when Muchen
        doubted his life, suddenly a childish voice came from outside.<br />At
        this moment, Mu Chen suddenly realized that he was actually in the elf
        ball.<br />Damn, no wonder I said, why is this room so small?<br />"Ash
        Ketchum, you woke up too late! All the Pokémon have been chosen by
        others.<br />Now, there is only this last Pokémon left, but it seems to
        have some problems. "<br />Obviously, this is deducing everything
        completely according to the plot in the animation.<br />"Hahaha!
        Pikachu, you will be my partner from now on!"<br />At this moment,
        Muchen was very irritable.<br />I'm such a straight man of steel!How
        dare you hug me, you sweaty brat?<br />What else is there to say?It must
        be an electric shock.<br />Although Muchen has just possessed Pikachu,
        this does not affect its ability to use its own skills.<br />Just
        kidding, although this system issued tasks to Lao Tzu, it also allowed
        Lao Tzu to see his own data panel, right?<br />Although that poor
        attribute made Mu Chen not interested in paying attention, Mu Chen still
        noticed the solitary electric shock on his skill panel.<br />"Fuck!"<br />An
        electric current flashed, and Ash Ketchum and Professor Oak changed into
        Shamat hairstyles without any accident.<br />Nima!Lao Tzu is really a
        weak B!<br />Seeing that an electric shock only changed someone's
        hairstyle, Muchen's heart was filled with grief and indignation.<br />At
        this level, how to complete the main task?<br />The price of failure is
        obliteration!<br />Although it is unacceptable to become this
        yellow-skinned mouse, but what, it is much better than going back to
        come directly, right?<br />"Pikachu, let's go, I'll take you to meet my
        mother Delia Ketchum, and then we're leaving!"<br />For the grief and
        indignation in Mu Chen's heart, Xiao Zhi naturally didn't know anything
        about it.<br />At this moment, this guy is in a state of excitement for
        becoming the trainer of the alliance.<br />"Ah! Ash Ketchum, is this the
        elf you received from the doctor?"<br />Not caring about the change of
        her son's hairstyle, Delia Ketchum's gaze was completely on that
        listless Pikachu.<br />Who! ?<br />correct!This guy just said he was
        going to see his mother, Delia Ketchum?<br />Attracted by the woman's
        voice, Muchen raised his drooping eyelids slightly.<br />Seeing this, Mu
        Chen was excited!<br />This shit!This is Ash Ketchum's mother?Are you
        kidding me?<br />What appeared in front of Muchen was a beautiful woman
        in her thirties.<br />"Ash Ketchum, it seems that your Pikachu likes me
        more~"<br />Seeing that Pikachu regained his energy because of his
        appearance, Delia Ketchum suddenly became interested.<br />"Ah! Mom,
        this little thing will shock people, be careful!"<br />Seeing that his
        mother wanted to take Pikachu from his shoulder, Ash Ketchum suddenly
        became nervous.<br />It doesn't matter if I get electrocuted, Professor
        Oak deserves to be electrocuted, and if my mother is also electrocuted,
        it will be a real crime.<br />"Hehehe~ No, look, how much does this
        little thing like mom?<br />ah!Don't move! "<br />Picking up Pikachu,
        Delia Ketchum immediately hugged him into her arms.<br />At this moment,
        Mu Chen suddenly felt that it would be nice to become a yellow-skinned
        mouse!<br />If it was human, which woman would hug you for no reason?<br />Now
        that I have become this cute-looking Pikachu, I can be liked by these
        lovely young ladies.<br />Is this a windfall?<br />"Okay, Ash Ketchum,
        it seems that your Pikachu is still very energetic.<br />Then, my dear
        son, mother blesses you, achieve your wish as soon as possible and
        become the champion of the league!<br />And you, Pikachu, must help my
        son, you must make progress together~"<br />The reddish Delia Ketchum
        took away Pikachu who was still fidgeting, and gave Ash Ketchum some
        motherly encouragement.<br />"Don't worry! Mom, with Pikachu's help, I
        will definitely become the league champion and the most powerful
        trainer!"<br />Ash Ketchum, who is ignorant and ignorant, obviously
        still doesn't understand what is happening in front of him.<br />At this
        moment, his young heart is full of longing for the future journey.<br />Of
        course, at this time, there is still one person who is very unhappy.<br />That
        person is naturally our poor Muchen.<br />I am Nima!How dare you take me
        away in such a second at night!<br />Being carried away suddenly,
        Muchen's heart was full of unwillingness.<br />However, Huazi obviously
        didn't give Muchen this chance.<br />Arms can't twist thighs, how could
        Mu Chen's small body be able to resist humans?<br />Seeing her son
        drifting away and Pikachu listless again, Delia Ketchum was full of
        doubts.<br />Where did Professor Oak get such a superb thing?<br />Of
        course, at this moment, Professor Oak doesn't have the energy to answer
        Delia Ketchum's question.<br />You know, after being rewarded with a
        shock by Pikachu, Professor Oak was busy re-doing his hair.<br />Just
        kidding, as a well-known figure in the Kanto region, I can't afford to
        lose this old man!

        <h2>Chapter 2: -</h2>
        "Fight, Pikachu, use electric shock to knock down this green
        caterpillar!"<br />I'll call you Nima!<br />Hearing Ash Ketchum's
        idiot-like command, Mu Chen kept complaining in his heart.<br />Ma De,
        it's about to hit the base, I hate it!<br />why!Why is it so unfair?<br />I
        want to change my trainer!Delia Ketchum!I want you to be my trainer!<br />Even
        if it's not Delia Ketchum, what kind of beauty, chestnut's female
        creature is fine!<br />I really don't want to travel with this idiot!<br />"Pikachu?
        Use an electric shock! What's wrong with you? The green caterpillar is
        about to escape!"<br />Obviously, Ash Ketchum didn't know anything about
        what Mu Chen was thinking.<br />At this moment, Ash Ketchum's eyes are
        completely on the green caterpillar wriggling in front of him.<br />if
        only!As long as Pikachuken gave him such a gentle electric shock, I
        could capture him!<br />This, but the first elf I met in the wild!<br />However,
        what Mu Chen misses at this moment is Huazi's warm embrace.<br />For Ash
        Ketchum's request, Mu Chen selectively ignored it.<br />Just kidding, I
        have this kung fu, why not remember the "sexual blessing" experience
        just now.<br />"Didi, the random mission is on.<br />Help Ash Ketchum
        get rid of the attack of the Beedrill swarm.<br />Task rewards, skills
        acquired, lightning flashes. "<br />Water! ?<br />What to do! ?<br />Mu
        Chen was stunned when he heard the electronic sound suddenly coming from
        the system.<br />This shit?random mission?Let me help that idiot! ?<br />But
        the reward skills seem to be pretty good, right?<br />Lightning flash?Is
        that the extremely fast sprint skill?<br />Groove!This is a good
        skill!If I knew this trick before, how could I miss the chance to get on
        base?<br />At this moment, Mu Chen cheered up again.<br />It is not
        terrible to miss that opportunity!<br />When I have learned this skill,
        I have nothing to say, as long as I encounter this kind of opportunity,
        I will decisively use it with a flash of lightning, and I will not be
        able to hit the base if I don't believe it!<br />However, what did the
        system say just now?<br />Help Ash Ketchum get rid of the attack of the
        Beedrill?Nima?Isn't it a green caterpillar?Why did you upgrade?<br />Apparently,
        Muchen, who was trapped in his own world, didn't realize it, because of
        his lack of cooperation, Ash Ketchum had already chosen to capture the
        green caterpillar by himself.<br />But I never thought that this elf
        ball was lost and slightly crooked.<br />Of course, it's fine if it's
        missing.<br />But the problem is, this elf ball was accidentally thrown
        on a Kakuna.<br />A Kakuna is not a green caterpillar.<br />This guy is
        a very combative existence.<br />Without a fight, the Poké Ball
        naturally cannot capture it.<br />Breaking out of the poke ball, the
        Kakuna didn't choose to attack Ash Ketchum directly, but raised its head
        and let out bursts of insect chirping.<br />immediately<br />"Buzz!"<br />The
        sky-shaking sound of insects came.<br />Apparently, the Kakuna used its
        ult, calling for reinforcements.<br />At the same time, Mu Chen also
        came to Ash Ketchum's side under the prompt of the system.<br />"Pikachu,
        what happened to you just now? Is there something uncomfortable? Are you
        hungry?"<br />Obviously, the pure Ash still doesn't know the reason for
        Pikachu's previous strike.<br />"Pickup~!"<br />He let out a feeble cry,
        which was a response to Ash Ketchum.<br />At this moment, Muchen's full
        attention is on the system task.<br />Nima?Beedrill?Where should the
        game be?<br />Eager to complete the task and get the reward directly, Mu
        Chen has already sharpened his sword, ready to send a powerful electric
        shock attack to the Beedrill that has not yet appeared.<br />But as the
        sound of "buzzing" approached, Mu Chen suddenly had a bad feeling.<br />Nima!Why
        do I feel gloomy?<br />The Beedrill seems to be the ultimate evolution
        of the Kakuna, right?<br />If you are singled out, can I win?Probably,
        should, okay?<br />Obviously, Mu Chen only paid attention to the task
        rewards given by the system, but he ignored the word "group" behind the
        Beedrill.<br />"No! Pikachu, run!"<br />As the saying goes, stand tall
        and see far.<br />No matter how bad Ash Ketchum is, he is still a boy in
        his teens, much taller than Mu Chen's poor Pikachu.<br />Before Muchen
        found the enemy, Ash Ketchum saw the swarm of Beedrills madly attacking
        him at the end of his field of vision.<br />"Pickup~!"<br />Hearing Ash
        Ketchum's words, Muchen immediately put on a fighting POSS.<br />But
        before he could fully enter the state, he suddenly reacted.<br />and
        many more!<br />This idiot, what did you just say?<br />run?Shouldn't I
        let Lao Tzu rush up to fight?<br />Puzzled, Muchen stood on tiptoe again
        and looked forward.<br />at last!<br />Muchen also found the swarm of
        Beedrills attacking madly.<br />I XX you OO!<br />Finally seeing the
        target, Mu Chen only had two words of cursing in his heart.<br />This
        shit!Dozens of Beedrills, why did you ask me to protect Ash Ketchum?<br />Go
        to your uncle!<br />Even a Beedrill, Muchen, doesn't have the courage to
        fight against it, let alone a group of them?<br />What else is there to
        say, let's go!<br />Ignoring Ash Ketchum who was turning around in
        embarrassment, Mu Chen turned his body around with an extremely elegant
        movement, his four claws flew wildly, and ran forward desperately.<br />I
        love so and so, I won't serve you anymore!<br />However, how can one run
        so fast?<br />Before Mu Chen and Ash Ketchum ran far, they were
        overtaken by a swarm of angry bees.<br />"Buzz!"<br />Without further
        ado, the angry swarm of Beedrills used their favorite skill, double
        needle.<br />Lying grass!It hurts!<br />Unfortunately, he was shot in
        the butt, and Mu Chen even accelerated his escape.<br />"Crash!"<br />Fortunately,
        just as Mu Chen and Xiao Zhi were covered in bruises from the bite, the
        heavens were beautiful, and a green rain suddenly fell.<br />For the
        Beedrill who hates rain, how can attacking the enemy be as important as
        avoiding the rain?<br />"Buzz!"<br />The swarm of bees gradually
        dispersed, and Mu Chen, who was safe, no longer had the strength to
        run.<br />Nima!I was an otaku in my previous life, when did I suffer
        from this crime?<br />"Pikachu! Pikachu! What's wrong with you? Hold on!
        Pikachu!"<br />Ash Ketchum deserves to be the existence who can become
        Master Zhi in the future, and his physical strength and ability to
        resist attacks must have reached full value.<br />Muchen couldn't hold
        on any longer, on the contrary, Ash Ketchum was still acting like a
        normal person.<br />Seeing Muchen fell in the rain, Ash Ketchum
        nervously picked him up, and frantically ran all the way to Changpan
        City, which is the closest to here.<br />I will go to your uncle!I don't
        want to be hugged by men!It smells like sweat, help me!<br />Although he
        didn't have to travel by himself, this experience was not beautiful to
        Muchen.<br />"Pickup~!"<br />However, his protest was just an inaudible
        cry.<br />
        <p></p>

        <h2>Chapter 3: -</h2>

        "Asshole! Give me back my bicycle!"<br />Due to too much physical
        exertion, Muchen finally fell into a coma.<br />When he regained
        consciousness, he suddenly heard a female voice.<br />woman!<br />Hearing
        the voice of the opposite sex, Muchen suddenly recovered.<br />Turning
        his head to look, he realized that he had been placed in the hurdle of a
        bicycle without knowing when.<br />And behind him, a girl is chasing the
        "car thief" Ash Ketchum crazily.<br />nice!<br />Looking at the girl's
        delicate face and well-proportioned figure, Mu Chen's originally
        sluggish spirit recovered.<br />idiot!Why don't you ride so fast!Didn't
        you see that young lady is going to be unable to catch up?<br />Tired
        young lady, you don't feel sorry for me!<br />"Pika~Chu~!"<br />However,
        after Muchen's protest, it was this cute cry that could melt people's
        hearts.<br />"Pikachu, are you awake? Hold on, we're about to reach
        Pallet Town! As long as you get there, you can get Miss Joey's
        treatment!"<br />Walter?<br />Nurse Joy! ?<br />Muchen, who was about to
        ignore this idiot's words, suddenly regained his spirits.<br />yes!Dad,
        I am in the world of Pokemon!<br />There are all kinds of girls in this
        world!<br />For example, what the idiot said just now, Nurse Joy!<br />No,
        I can't come to my senses, otherwise, would this idiot send me to see
        Nurse Joy?<br />Thinking of this, Muchen quickly forced himself to
        extinguish the restless little flame in his heart.<br />At this moment,
        it's not the time for me to explode!<br />"Okay, hold on, we're in
        Pallet Town!"<br />Finally, while Mu Chen waited bitterly, Ash Ketchum
        uttered the most satisfying sentence so far.<br />"Bastard! Thief!
        Robber! My bicycle!"<br />Chasing all the way, the girl with amazing
        physical strength followed closely behind, and followed Ash Ketchum to
        Pallet Town.<br />"Young man, please show your ID.<br />The lady just
        said that you stole her bicycle?Is it this one?what happened? "<br />Before
        Ash Ketchum could explain, a clear female voice came over.<br />Attracted
        by the female voice, Mu Chen, who pretended to be unconscious, slightly
        raised his closed eyelids.<br />Seeing this, Mu Chen jumped up from Ash
        Ketchum's arms almost excitedly.<br />Nima!uniform!<br />no more!I can't
        do it anymore!<br />When Mu Chen saw this beautiful woman in uniform who
        appeared in front of him, he fell into a trap.<br />Thinking that Mu
        Chen was just a dead house dick, how had he ever seen such an
        outstanding beauty in uniform with his own eyes?<br />At this moment, Mu
        Chen realized that the uniforms played by various teachers he had seen
        before were not on the same level as this beauty.<br />"Oh! Officer
        Jenny!<br />Well, my Pikachu got hurt and I borrowed the bike because it
        was an emergency.<br />Now the bicycle is returned to you, sorry. "<br />Officer
        Jenny is an official who maintains law and order. Seeing her appear, Ash
        Ketchum explained repeatedly.<br />!!!<br />This is Officer Jenny! ?<br />No
        wonder!No wonder!<br />Hearing Ash Ketchum's voice, Mu Chen finally knew
        who the beauty who made him fall was.<br />ah!system!Lao Tzu, I am so
        grateful to your eight generations of ancestors!<br />At this moment,
        Muchen's heart was full of gratitude to the system.<br />If it wasn't
        for the system guy, how could I have traveled to such a wonderful
        world?<br />Even at this moment, Muchen is full of joy at the fact that
        he is a Pikachu instead of a human.<br />Just kidding, I have such a
        cute appearance, don't these young ladies take advantage of it
        casually?<br />"Well, your Pikachu seems to be seriously injured, and
        has fallen into a sluggish state, so hurry up and send it to Miss
        Joey.<br />This time it happened for a reason, so forget it.<br />If
        there are similar behaviors in the future, be careful that I am rude to
        you! "<br />Of course Officer Jenny didn't know what Mu Chen was
        thinking.<br />Seeing this Pikachu's eyes were dull, his mouth was wide
        open, and he didn't even know that saliva was flowing down his mouth.<br />Miss
        Jun Sha decisively judged that this Pokémon had fallen into a near-death
        state.<br />With Officer Jenny's understanding, Ash Ketchum is naturally
        very grateful.<br />After bidding farewell to Officer Jenny, Ash Ketchum
        followed the route she gave and ran towards the elf center where Miss
        Joey was.<br />As for Muchen?<br />This guy is obviously still stuck in
        his own happy little world.<br />"Ah! Trainer, how could your Pokmon be
        injured to such an extent?<br />This, this has completely entered a
        state of sluggishness, how can you treat your Pokémon like this? "<br />When
        Muchen regained consciousness again, what he heard in his ears was Nurse
        Joy's slightly reproachful questioning voice.<br />Nima!This little
        movement is so sweet!<br />Awakened by Nurse Joy's voice, Muchen
        regained his vitality again.<br />When he turned his head to look, this
        guy was dumbfounded again.<br />Nima!uniform!Uniforms again!<br />Don't
        be so exciting!<br />There was a uniform just now, and now there is
        another uniform!<br />However, this Nurse Joy with this uniform is
        completely different from the Yujie Junsha just now!<br />Not bad, not
        bad, I like this old man too!<br />When Muchen was hugged by the sweet
        Nurse Joy, he was already so excited that he couldn't control
        himself.<br />The slightly trembling body made Ms. Joy think that it was
        caused by her serious injuries.<br />"Blissey, I will leave this little
        guy to you, you must make it recover~"<br />Before Muchen could make a
        move, Nurse Joy handed it over to a huge egg-shaped Pokémon.<br />"lucky~~"<br />Skillfully
        took over Muchen from Ms. Joy's hand, Blissey immediately entered the
        working state.<br />I am Nima!Young lady?How did you abandon me?<br />I
        don't want this fat and fat idiot to treat me!What I need is you, Lao
        Tzu!<br />Under Muchen's desperate eyes, Nurse Joy gradually moved away
        from its sight.<br />"Crack!"<br />Just when Muchen was about to break
        free from Blissey's arms, this guy had already come in front of the
        recovery machine, ignored Muchen's reaction, and placed it directly in
        the machine.<br />Nima!My little sister!<br />Under Muchen's unwilling
        eyes, the Blissey turned its bloated body around, and started the
        machine with a dazzling operation.<br />"Hoo! Hoo!"<br />The hypnotic
        mist that helped the elves fall asleep was blown out from the sealed
        machine, and Muchen fell into a coma without any resistance.<br />Fuck!I
        just remembered, did I finish the random task before?<br />This was Mu
        Chen's last thought before falling into a coma.<br />
        <p></p>

        <h2>Chapter 4: -</h2>

        "Pika~Chu!"<br />Unexplainably, he was healed, and Mu Chen, who was sent
        back to Ash Ketchum, uttered a cry of lovelessness.<br />Nima!After all
        the hard work, I didn't even touch Nurse Joy's hand?<br />Thinking that
        he was in that fat man's embrace the whole time before, Muchen's tears
        couldn't stop flowing down.<br />fraud!What the fuck is a liar!What
        about Miss?<br />If I had known that this guy was here to treat Lao Tzu,
        why the hell would I pretend to be in a coma?<br />"Wow! This is your
        elf! It really is full of vitality.<br />However, even if this is the
        case, you must compensate my bicycle! "<br />When the girl's voice came,
        Mu Chen realized that the girl who had been chasing the two before was
        also beside his master, Xiao Zhi.<br />Looking at this girl who is not
        yet fully developed, but already has a pair of fit and long legs, Mu
        Chen is full of interest.<br />This one, could it be that Misty in the
        animation?<br />Although Muchen doesn't know much about the Pokémon
        world, he has heard of this heroine to some extent.<br />pity!such a
        pity!<br />This one, it would be great if he could be a few years
        older.<br />This is the only thought in Mu Chen's mind at the moment.<br />I
        can't bear the underage lolita~<br />Why?wrong! ?Why did I float?<br />Just
        when Muchen was still regretting how much younger this girl who was
        suspected to be Misty was, he suddenly realized that he had been lifted
        into the sky in a foolish way?<br />what's the situation! ?<br />"Hey,
        it's cute, right? This, it's my first elf~!<br />As for your bicycle.
        Don't worry!I will definitely make it up to you. "<br />Lying grass!This
        idiot, why did he hug me again! ?<br />Being hugged by Ash Ketchum is
        one of the things Mu Chen extremely dislikes.<br />Just kidding, I am a
        pure man, how can I be hugged by this sweaty man?<br />This, what else
        is there to say, I will shock you away.<br />"Zi La~!"<br />Electricity
        flashed.<br />"Um, are you okay?"<br />Seeing Xiao Zhi who had
        transformed into a Shamat boy again, Xiao Xia suddenly began to wonder,
        where did this Pikachu get stolen from?<br />"Ah? Hahaha! It's okay!
        It's okay! This is a way to enhance our relationship."<br />To be able
        to become the existence of Zhiye in the future, his way of thinking must
        be different from ordinary people.<br />Ignoring the two people who were
        talking, Muchen put his mind on the system.<br />Nima, what's the
        matter?<br />I should have completed the random task before, right?Why
        is there no reaction at all?<br />"The system is being upgraded, and the
        rewards are delayed."<br />Amidst Mu Chen's calls, the damn system
        finally gave him a response.<br />However, the content of this response
        made it unacceptable.<br />System Upgrade?What's the matter with
        Nima?<br />Dad, I just traveled over here, right?<br />Why did you
        upgrade just now?What kind of system do you have?<br />"In view of the
        host's special hobbies, the company has made some adjustments to the
        system's functions. Please wait patiently and wish you a pleasant
        use."<br />Water! ?<br />In view of Lao Tzu's special hobbies?<br />This
        shit?Dad, what are my hobbies?Why don't I know?<br />If you are male and
        you like female, how do you adjust this?Do you want me to switch with
        this idiot, so I can't restore my human body?<br />Lying grass!No!How
        can a human body get into Miss Sister's arms?Wouldn't he be beaten to
        death?<br />At this moment, Muchen panicked.<br />Before that, he still
        rejected his own body, but since the Huazi incident, Muchen is very
        satisfied with this body.<br />Just kidding, you can get into people's
        arms by showing off your cuteness, where can you find such a good
        job?<br />"Are you planning to go to the gymnasium in Nibi City to
        challenge?<br />That's just right, my home is in Hualan City, which is
        behind Nibi City, and we happened to drop by.<br />However, I can tell
        you that you must compensate for my bicycle! "<br />At this moment, the
        girl's voice came again, which made Mu Chen completely confirm the guess
        in his heart.<br />This loli with long legs is Misty!<br />Fortunately,
        fortunately, the plot is still developing normally!<br />After
        confirming that this girl is Misty, Mu Chen's uneasy heart calmed
        down.<br />At the very least, when I travel, there are always beauties
        by my side, right?<br />Although she is a loli, but her long legs are
        also very good~<br />Besides, after confirming Misty, Muchen can confirm
        the existence of another person.<br />She is Team Rocket's Jessie!<br />Misty
        is nothing to look at as a loli, but Jessie is an out-and-out Yujie.<br />Thinking
        of Jessie's fiery red hair and hot figure, Muchen became excited.<br />adventure
        eh?I am coming!<br />Filled with expectations and motivation for the
        future again, Muchen finally got rid of the listless state before.<br />However,
        the reality is cruel, and things often backfire.<br />"Let's go,
        Pikachu!"<br />Under Ash Ketchum's idiot-like command, Mu Chen looked at
        the enemy in front of him, Pidgey, with a look of grief and
        indignation.<br />Damn, I am still a cub, my skill is only an electric
        shock!<br />Why did you choose such a high-end opponent for me in the
        first battle?I am not the skin god in the cartoon!<br />"Beep~beep~~"<br />However,
        the angry Pidgey would not pay attention to what Mu Chen was
        thinking.<br />For this existence that dared to violate its own
        territory, and even threw it with a poke ball, Pidgey was absolutely
        intolerable.<br />This is a naked provocation to it.<br />"Pikachu, use
        electromagnetic waves to interfere with Bibi's flight speed!"<br />Under
        normal circumstances, an elf like Pikachu, even a cub, can completely
        master the basic skills of electromagnetic waves.<br />But
        unfortunately, Muchen is an abnormal existence.<br />"Oh, Pikachu,
        besides electric shock, what skills do you have?"<br />Looking at
        Pikachu with a helpless face, Ash Ketchum, as a trainer, was also
        confused.<br />why?Isn't that how it is introduced in the Pokémon
        Illustrated Book?Why can't my Pikachu know anything but electric
        people?<br />Nima, the system has been maintained, and I don't give me
        skills. Is there anything I can do?<br />Spreading his hands helplessly
        at Ash Ketchum, Mu Chen once again focused on the battle with a face
        full of grief and indignation.<br />If you want to show off your cute
        diamond collar, you have to pay a corresponding price.<br />In this
        world, with his elf ball in the hands of that idiot, Mu Chen really has
        no way to resist.<br />"Pika~Chu!"<br />Isn't it just a Pidgey?<br />bring
        it on!I am not afraid of you, Lao Tzu!<br />A cry to boost his morale
        came out, and Muchen used his only skill, electric shock.<br />
        <p></p>

        <h2>Chapter 5: -</h2>

        Nima!This is not a human job at all!<br />Muchen found out with grief
        and indignation that in reality, elf battles are not at all like in
        games.<br />What the hell!Why can't I hit that big bird with my electric
        shock?<br />How dare you stop?Do you dare to call me?<br />Facing this
        unusually flexible Pidgey, even though Mu Chen had tried his best,
        lightning flashed all over the sky.<br />However, its only function is
        to create this effect like fireworks, but it can't hit the target at
        all.<br />"Beep~beep~!"<br />After being entangled for a few times and
        bypassing all of Mu Chen's electric shock attacks, Pidgey changed the
        direction of flight with an extremely elegant flip, and shot towards Mu
        Chen, who was blushing below, as if he was constipated.<br />Therefore,
        it is one of the flying elf's proud skills, the turning attack.<br />"Pikachu!
        Be careful!"<br />Now, through this battle, Ash Ketchum has discovered
        that his Pikachu seems to only know the electric shock skill.<br />However,
        this is his original elf, his travel companion, Ash Ketchum will not
        abandon it naturally.<br />After seeing Pidgey launch a counterattack,
        Ash Ketchum quickly called out loudly, reminding Mu Chen to be careful
        of the attack from the sky.<br />"Pickup~!"<br />Although Muchen also
        noticed Pidgey's attack, but relying on its short legs, how could it
        outrun Pidgey who is good at flying?<br />A painful cry came from
        Pikachu's mouth.<br />Of course, this is the voice Ash Ketchum and Misty
        heard.<br />Actually.<br />I x you uncle!It hurts so much!help!I don't
        want to play anymore!I won't drill the collar of Miss Sister
        anymore!Master System, let me turn back into a human!<br />At this
        moment, Mu Chen suddenly realized that his old house life was more
        suitable for him.<br />This kind of life-threatening work, he is not
        suitable for me at all!<br />"Beep~beep~!"<br />Of course Pidgey didn't
        know what Mu Chen was thinking.<br />Seeing that his blow worked, Pidgey
        was even more refreshed.<br />You know, before facing Pikachu, Pidgey
        still had a certain sense of nervousness.<br />Anyway, this is also an
        elf whose attributes can restrain it.<br />In the end, when they really
        fought against each other, Pidgey realized that this was a weak chicken
        at all.<br />The skill only has a single electric shock, and it can only
        be used indiscriminately.<br />Of course, Pidgey would not let go of the
        opportunity to abuse food like this.<br />I saw him turn around again in
        the air, and kill the embarrassed Mu Chen again.<br />"Ash Ketchum! Your
        Pikachu can't hold on anymore, do you want me to help you?"<br />Seeing
        how desolate Pikachu was under Pidgey's attack, Misty couldn't stand it
        anymore.<br />This isn't fighting at all, is it?Is this all Bibi Niao's
        unilateral abuse of food?<br />"No! I believe my partner, Pikachu will
        definitely win!"<br />Master Zhi is Master Zhi.<br />This kind of
        self-confidence is something most people will never have.<br />Of
        course, the embarrassed Mu Chen didn't hear these words, otherwise this
        guy would definitely scold his mother again.<br />You are so confident,
        why don't you come up and try it yourself?<br />"Pickup!!!"<br />The
        painful cry came again.<br />This time, Muchen was completely angry.<br />I
        x you uncle!I can bear you so much that you abuse me.<br />How dare you
        peck Lao Tzu's chrysanthemum with your beak! ?<br />During the
        embarrassing escape before, Mu Chen was unfortunately pecked by
        Pidgey.<br />Normally, the damage of this skill is not as high as the
        turn attack, and Mu Chen can still bear it.<br />but!It was a
        coincidence that this peck hit the backyard of Muchen who was running
        away.<br />This really made Mu Chen intolerable.<br />Embarrassed and
        angry, Muchen no longer ran away.<br />Looking at Pidgey who turned back
        again, Muchen transformed all the shame and resentment in his heart into
        electricity.<br />"Pika~Chu~!"<br />A roar.<br />An electric current
        that was much thicker than before condensed from Mu Chen's cheeks, and
        then shot out towards the oncoming Pidgey.<br />"Beep~!"<br />Seeing
        this finger-thick electric current, Pidgey was startled.<br />However,
        the momentum has already started, how could it be so easy to adjust the
        body shape?<br />"Zi La~!"<br />The electric current carried Mu Chen's
        expectation, and shot fiercely on Pidgey's body.<br />"Beep!!!"<br />This
        time, the painful chirping sound finally changed its master.<br />Looking
        at Pidgey who was knocked down by his electric shock, Mu Chen still
        couldn't let go of his hatred, and released another electric shock to
        the opponent who was lying on the ground and twitching continuously.<br />Nima!Let
        you f-ck show off with me, let you f-ck play with me and me.<br />Are
        you showing off?Are you hiding?Don't you love popping
        chrysanthemums?keep going!<br />"Pickup~!"<br />Of course, when these
        words reached Ash Ketchum's ears, it was Pikachu celebrating his
        victory.<br />"Hahaha! Pikachu, great job! I knew you would do it!<br />Well,
        don't charge it anymore, it will die if you continue to charge it!<br />Let
        me subdue it! "<br />Seeing that Pikachu had defeated Pidgey, Xiao Zhi
        shouted excitedly.<br />However, when he turned his attention to Pidgey
        again, he realized this.<br />Pidgey had been electrocuted by the angry
        Pikachu until his whole body was scorched black, and even his
        convulsions had gradually ceased.<br />Obviously, if the power goes on,
        Pidgey is afraid that it will directly become a roast chicken.<br />How
        could Ash Ketchum, who wanted to subdue the Pokémon, let go of this
        Pidgey that he "personally" defeated?<br />Therefore, this guy hurriedly
        made a noise to stop Pikachu who was still releasing electric shocks.<br />"Pika~Chu~!"<br />Muchen's
        response to Ash Ketchum was to release another electric shock attack.<br />stop?joke!<br />This
        guy exploded my chrysanthemum, you tell me to stop?<br />Muchen swears,
        since he was born, until he died in the house for several years later,
        he has never suffered such a huge humiliation!<br />But just when he was
        about to make persistent efforts to turn this hateful Pidgey into a
        roast chicken, an electronic sound suddenly came from his ears.<br />"The
        system upgrade is complete, and version 2.0 of the Skin God system is
        activated.<br />The new version opens the intrusion mode, please
        experience it.<br />Random mission rewards, please check. "<br />Water!
        ?<br />Upgraded successfully?<br />Hearing the electronic sound from the
        system, Mu Chen was taken aback for a moment.<br />Damn, how long did it
        take for you to level up, Lao Tzu? It turned out so fast?<br />However,
        what the hell is this random entry mode?What about version 2.0?What are
        you doing with me?<br />There were many questions in his head, but the
        system did not give Mu Chen the slightest answer.<br />And just when Mu
        Chen was in a daze, Xiao Zhi decisively threw the elf ball that had been
        prepared.<br />"Pidgey, I've subdued you!"<br />Picking up the Poké Ball
        that was subdued without any resistance at all, Ash Ketchum yelled out
        his classic lines.<br />
