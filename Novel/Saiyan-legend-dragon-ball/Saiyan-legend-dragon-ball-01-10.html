        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        Make a Wish to the Dragon<br /><br />In a certain place on the earth in
        the Dragon Ball world, the sky was cloudless, suddenly a red light
        flashed, and then there was a bang, and a circular space capsule landed
        on the earth.<br /><br />creak<br />The round space hatch opened, and a
        child with a tail came out of it, wearing a blue combat uniform, wearing
        a detector in his eyes, and a bang on his forehead, which looked exactly
        like Gogeta.<br /><br />It's obviously a Saiyan<br />beep, beep, beep<br />"One
        with a combat power of 130, it should be the perverted old man
        Guixianren, and the other one with a combat power of about [-] should be
        the god Piccolo."<br /><br />"Huh? The combat power is ten, it can't be
        wrong, according to the original book, the guy Monkey King just walked
        out of Baozi Mountain is ten combat power."<br /><br />"I don't know
        where the plot is going? Did Shenlong call out? My current combat power
        of [-] is enough to walk sideways here."<br /><br />Hearing the sound of
        stepping, the Saiyan child raised his right hand to his ear, snapped his
        fingers, and a crack opened in the space around him, and the spaceship
        that came was swallowed instantly.<br /><br />This is his innate talent
        for space called Dimensional World, but currently there is only one
        function and that is storage.<br /><br />"To the southwest... let's
        go."<br /><br />Swipe, while speaking, the mysterious Saiyan flew
        towards Monkey King with white gas flames all over his body.<br /><br />At
        the same time, the eternal cat eyes of the Cat Immortal in Kalinta
        suddenly widened, and the crutch in his hand fell to the ground at some
        point<br />"How... how is it possible, how could such a powerful person
        come to the earth, what is the reason?"<br /><br />At the same time, the
        god Piccolo in the Temple of Heaven was also shocked, with cold sweat
        dripping from his old forehead. He originally thought he was the
        strongest, but now it seems that he is still watching the sky from a
        well.<br /><br />"Although the aura of this person is somewhat evil, it
        is more righteous. It should be both good and evil. I hope it will not
        harm the earth."<br /><br />...........................<br /><br />Belokas,
        originally an ordinary youth on Earth, was hit by a meteorite while
        admiring a meteor shower. After going through an unknown number of years
        of darkness, he was reborn on Planet Vegeta in the dark and became a A
        traverser.<br /><br />Belokas, who was born not long after, was sent to
        a low-level planet because he was detected to have low combat
        effectiveness.<br /><br />It is also because of this that Belokas
        escaped from the imminent destruction of Planet Vegeta. Ten years later,
        Belokas killed everyone on that planet.<br /><br />There is no other
        reason, the people on that planet don't have much ability, but they are
        very evil.<br /><br />After a year of space travel, Belokas came to the
        earth.<br /><br />Different from others, Belokas' tail is naturally red,
        which makes Belokas, who is familiar with various versions of Dragon
        Ball, very suspicious.<br /><br />Because he's never heard of any saiyan
        with a red tail, except super saiyan [-], but obviously belokas he's
        not.<br /><br />But this tail brings only one function to Belokas at
        present, that is, after the transformation of the great ape of Belokas
        is irradiated with enough moonlight, he can choose not to transform
        himself, and of course he will not change after transformation. Lost my
        mind.<br /><br />"Ha, it seems that we have caught up, let me make a
        wish for Shenlong in the near future!"<br /><br />When he saw Bulma
        being turned into a carrot by a rabbit, Belokas knew that the journey to
        find the Dragon Balls was only halfway started.<br /><br />In the next
        scene, of course, Xiao Wukong was beaten up because Bulma was in the
        hands of others, and finally Yamcha, who tried to capture the Dragon
        Ball at the end, helped, and finally the rabbit demon was sent to the
        moon by Xiao Wukong.<br /><br />Belokas still didn't participate in the
        battle for the Dragon Balls along the way for Xiao Wukong, but just
        watched from a distance. All he wanted was the last chance to make a
        wish to Shenlong.<br /><br />As we all know, after Little Goku collected
        the Dragon Balls, Shenlong's wish was a pair of women's underwear.
        Belokas really wondered if Shenlong was confused when he heard this
        wish.<br /><br />Therefore, instead of making this wish, it is better to
        change another one and let Belokas make a wish,<br /><br />Anyway, in
        the end, both Yamcha and Bulma's wishes came true.<br /><br />One found
        his first love, the other overcame his fear of women, and as for Xiao
        Wukong, this guy has nothing but desires to become stronger.<br /><br />Furthermore,
        it is also a good choice to watch a real-life version of Dragon Ball,
        and not everyone has this opportunity.<br /><br />In the end, after a
        few days, all of Xiao Wukong's Dragon Balls were stolen by Pilaf and his
        team except for the four planets.<br /><br />Finally, in order to get
        back the Dragon Ball, Goku and his party came to Pilaf's castle, and
        finally, after going through many traps, they were caught by a trap with
        an arrow pattern on the ground.<br /><br />Seeing this, Bellocas
        shouted<br />"Damn, isn't this obviously a trap? I don't know what these
        people think."<br /><br />Seeing this, Pilaf also broke out in cold
        sweat on his forehead, and he seemed to breathe a sigh of relief: "That
        kind of idiot's trap can also be fooled..."<br /><br />Belokas was
        outside Pilaf Castle that night, waiting for Pilaf and his party to
        summon the dragon<br />This night, there are no clouds in the sky, the
        stars are dotted with stars, it is the time of the full moon, and the
        transformation of Xiao Wukong may not be far away<br /><br />Well,
        maybe!<br />Sure enough, not long after, Pilaf and his party came out of
        the palace, and Axiu was holding a wooden plate in his hand, on which
        seven dragon balls had been placed for several years.<br /><br />Finally
        Pilaf put the dragon ball on the ground and said the spell to summon the
        dragon<br />"Come out, Shenlong, come out and fulfill my wish!!"<br /><br />Under
        Pilaf's call, the seven dragon balls on the ground shone brightly, and
        for a moment, dark clouds were covered with lightning and thunder, and
        the whole world turned into night.<br /><br />As time passed, a phantom
        of a dragon emerged, and a moment later a huge green dragon appeared in
        front of him.<br /><br />The huge size makes the people around feel a
        little awe. Not far away, the two Oolongs who turned into bats are
        rushing to try to stop Pilaf's ambition to dominate the world.<br /><br />"Did
        you call me out?"<br /><br />"Yes, it is"<br /><br />"Tell me your wish,
        no matter what it is, I can make it come true for you"<br /><br />The
        huge green dragon head spoke, but under the words, Pilaf stammered
        instead<br /><br />Seeing this, Belokas on the side secretly thought
        that sure enough, the plot has not changed yet, but the opportunity to
        make a wish cannot be delayed.<br /><br />Belokas appeared in front of
        Pilaf in an instant, stunned several people at a very fast speed, and
        finally said to Shenlong: "Shenlong, I hope to get all the training in
        martial arts, magic and special skills within 100 years from now.
        method."<br /><br />Suddenly, Shenlong's red eyes emitted a strange red
        light, saying: "Your wish has been fulfilled, I have put them into your
        mind, just check it out."<br /><br />"Then, goodbye (Sara Bada)"<br /><br />After
        speaking, the dragon disappeared, and the seven dragon balls flew into
        the sky and flew towards the world.<br /><br />Seeing this, Bulma and
        Wukong who were not far away breathed a sigh of relief. Although they
        failed to realize their wish, they finally did not let Pilaf rule the
        world.<br /><br />(End of this chapter)
        <p></p>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
        Saiyans, I will destroy the moon<br /><br />"Great, you're done, with
        all this knowledge, I can develop moves with space abilities!!"<br /><br />Belokas
        flicked a bunch of bangs on his forehead inertially and said with a
        slight smile<br />Immediately, I began to look at the extra memories in
        my mind.<br /><br />'Kame School Qigong, Turtle Shockwave, Wukong
        Technique, Transformation Technique, Manipulating Qi Bomb, Ultimate
        Flash, Ten Thousand Kingdoms Shocking Palm, Qi Yuan Zhan, Sun Fist,
        Qigong Cannon, Yuan Qi Bomb, Hole Wave, Four Demon Fist, Instant
        Movement, true teleportation, white magic, black magic, mind reading,
        Super Saiyan transformation conditions...'<br /><br />In an instant, as
        long as it is the tricks, magic and special skills that appear in Dragon
        Ball, everything appears in Belokas' mind.<br /><br />Not long after,
        Belokas came back to his senses, and came to the outside of the wall
        where Pilaf imprisoned Xiao Wukong and others.<br /><br />The shock in
        Yamcha and Goku's eyes can be seen through the small hole that Goku
        broke through with his immature Kamehae qigong, because the speed has
        surpassed their cognition.<br /><br />Seeing this, Little Wukong swept
        away the hunger in his stomach. Although the person in front of him was
        very powerful, his eyes revealed endless excitement.<br /><br />The more
        they fight, the stronger they become. Even though there is a little fear
        in the face of a powerful existence, there is more excitement and
        endless fighting spirit. This is the famous fighting race Saiyan.<br /><br />"Can
        you let us out?" asked Bulma at the side<br /><br />"Of course you can,
        back away."<br /><br />Bellocas said, with his [-] points of combat
        power, it is easy to break a wall.<br /><br />I saw Belokas raised his
        hand, lightly slapped the wall and turned it into rubble, and the finger
        touched it and immediately fell apart.<br /><br />"The control is
        so-so."<br /><br />I have been exercising for so many years, but I am
        still unsatisfied. It is really difficult to walk without a master. It
        seems that it is necessary to go to Karinta.<br /><br />"You are very
        strong, can you fight me?" Xiao Wukong asked fearlessly as a newborn
        calf<br /><br />"Long time no see, Kakarot." Belokas said inexplicably.
        In fact, both of them were born on the same day. Belokas met him when he
        was born and... Broly .<br /><br />"Kakarot? What's that? I'm Monkey
        King, Monkey King" Xiao Wukong emphasized, as if he was not very cold
        about his original name<br />"Kakarot is your original name. You had a
        head injury and naturally forgot it. Didn't you realize that we are of
        the same race?" Belokas said, flicking the bright red tail behind
        him.<br /><br />"Oh, the tail, it's really the same as mine." Xiao
        Wukong pointed at Belokas' tail and said<br />"Are you aliens?" Bulma
        asked. Although there are many strange animals and humans on the ground,
        she has never seen a person with a tail behind the buttocks.<br /><br />"Yeah,
        Wukong and I were originally cosmic beings, but he had a head injury
        before, so he doesn't remember me. In fact, we were born on the same
        day," Bellocas said<br />"Can you fight me?" Goku asked again<br />"You're
        too weak now, I'm not interested, Goku, as a fighting race Saiyan
        shouldn't be so weak" Bellocas said<br />In the first Dragon Ball,
        although Xiao Wukong later became the most powerful man on earth, in the
        final analysis, he only has a combat power of more than 400, and the
        degree of improvement can be extremely slow.<br /><br />However, in the
        Z period, it is not a problem to increase hundreds of thousands a day.
        There is a five-year interval between the first part and the second
        part. However, Wukong has not improved much during these five years. The
        reason for this is the enemy.<br /><br />Even Belokas himself was able
        to advance to this point because of the existence of enemies. It has to
        be said that the universe is too vast.<br /><br />"Fighting clan
        Saiyan?"<br /><br />"Yes, the Saiyans are a fighting clan. In order to
        fight, they will always maintain the appearance of children until they
        become adults and then grow up quickly. Therefore, our youth is very
        long, and our food intake is particularly large. Every time we go from
        the edge of death The combat power of the revived will be greatly
        increased.”<br /><br />"For the fun of survival and fighting, our
        mission is to find valuable planets, then kill the local residents, and
        sell them to other aliens at high prices in exchange for technology and
        resources"<br /><br />"The tail is the symbol of the Saiyans, and it is
        also a weakness. This can be changed through training. When the full
        moon receives enough Bultz rays, the eyes will respond through the tail
        and become a gorilla. After the transformation, the fighting power will
        increase. ten times"<br /><br />"The lower-level fighters will lose
        their minds after transformation, but the upper-level fighters and those
        with royal blood will not. You see, it's like this..."<br /><br />When a
        group of people were shocked by Belokas' words, the curious little Goku
        glanced at the moon and began to transform.<br /><br />thump, thump,
        thump<br /><br />There was a burst of heartbeat, and Xiao Wukong's face
        gradually became hideous, his muscles became bigger and bigger, and his
        hair covered his whole body.<br /><br />Roar!<br />With another roar,
        Goku's transformation into a great ape was completed, and Pilaf's castle
        was destroyed<br />"How...how did this happen? Can you transform? Let us
        go!!"<br /><br />"I'm still a beautiful girl who loves spring, I don't
        want to die... woo woo"<br /><br />Bulma, who was lifted into the air by
        Belokas at some point, shouted<br />"It seems that I am no different
        from ordinary Saiyans. Transforming into a giant ape increases the
        combat power by ten times. Isn't this tail really my golden finger?"<br /><br />Carefully
        looking at the transformed little Wukong in front of him, Belokas
        couldn't help but think to himself<br />Red tail, born different from
        others<br /><br />He always thought it was his golden finger<br />There
        are many functions waiting for his development<br /><br />But the
        current situation does not seem to be<br />"Forget it, let's solve the
        problem at hand first, the moon will be destroyed by me"<br /><br />After
        Belokas put down Bulma and Yamcha, he folded his hands to his waist, and
        laid them out in a posture of Kamehae Qigong.<br /><br />"Turtle (ka)...
        pie (no ha)... gas (no)..."<br /><br />"Gong (ha)..."<br /><br />I saw a
        huge blue light wave shooting towards the sky and heading towards the
        moon. There seemed to be a bang in the universe, and the moon
        disappeared immediately.<br /><br />In the original book, the moon was
        destroyed by Kameshi, but now it is Belokas who does it. Saiyan's tail
        is indeed a weakness, but it can be overcome.<br /><br />Belokas always
        thinks that the tail is an important source of Saiyan's strength. Didn't
        you see that in the original book, when Goku's tail grew out, his combat
        effectiveness improved a lot?<br />When weakness is no longer weakness,
        then he will be perfect<br />After the moon was destroyed, Little Wukong
        returned to his original form, lying naked on the ground and sleeping
        soundly, but he was still cute despite this.<br /><br />But Bulma on the
        side was so shocked that the moon was destroyed like this?<br /><br />"Bulma,
        this is a combat power detector. I always suspect that there is an
        eavesdropping device on it. After you take it back, check it for me. If
        not, please help me upgrade it."<br /><br />Belokas took off the combat
        power detector on the eye socket and said, the story of Vegeta and
        others in the original book is a lesson, so Belokas has been careful, if
        it changes the plot because of this thing, then hehe !<br /><br />"Okay,
        no problem." With the strength shown by Belokas, she had no reason to
        refuse.<br /><br />"When Wukong woke up, he told him that we will meet
        again at the World's No. [-] Martial Arts Conference, and hope that it
        will be strong enough."<br /><br />"Bye-Bye!!"<br /><br />After
        speaking, Belokas soared into the sky, and the next target - the holy
        land of Carlin<br /><br />(End of this chapter)
        <p></p>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
        Kalinta, past present and future<br /><br />"Is this Kalinta? It's
        really not ordinary tall!"<br /><br />Belokas looked up at Kalinta who
        couldn't see the side and muttered to himself<br />It is here that Xiao
        Wukong drank the super god water, it is here that Xiao Wukong defeated
        Tao Baibai, and it is here that Xiao Wukong gained the strength to
        defeat the first generation of Piccolo.<br /><br />Not only can the
        strength be improved here, but there is also a kind of magical thing
        called Xiandou.<br /><br />No matter how many injuries you have
        suffered, as long as you eat one, you will be as good as before, as long
        as you eat one, you will not be hungry for ten days.<br /><br />The only
        downside is that it can't heal<br /><br />Even so, these two functions,
        no matter what the situation is, are extremely attractive to Saiyans.<br /><br />Fairy
        beans, Belokas is determined to win<br /><br />"Who are you? What are
        you doing in this holy place?"<br /><br />Then a heavy voice sounded<br /><br />Belokas
        turned his head and saw another... no, two familiar faces!<br />A little
        guy and a big guy, both of them are the original residents who have
        lived in the Kalin Holy Land for generations and guarded the Kalin Holy
        Land for generations.<br /><br />They are Upa and his father Pola and
        his son. When Goku was looking for the Dragon Ball for the second time,
        Pola was killed by Tao Baibai because of the relationship of the Red
        Silk Army. So Goku made up his mind to gather seven Dragon Balls to
        revive Pola.<br /><br />This seems to be another chance to make a wish,
        with me here, you won't die even if you want to!<br />"Yo, I'm a martial
        artist, and I'm here to challenge Kalinta"<br /><br />Belokas said that
        although his own can fly up directly, he still wants to try how long it
        will take him to go all out to climb Kalin Tower.<br /><br />Sun Wukong,
        the former idol, he also wants to try the road he has had<br /><br />"Many
        people have come to challenge in the past, but there is no doubt that
        they all failed. They were either exhausted halfway, or starved to death
        without food"<br /><br />"Dad, there was a man who succeeded 300 years
        ago."<br /><br />Upa reminded that who this person is, Belokas naturally
        knows, it is Wutian teacher who is known as the god of martial arts -
        Guixianren<br />Currently the strongest earthling, although he is a
        perverted old man, there is no doubt that he is a good master, an
        outstanding martial artist<br /><br />Even if she is lustful, she will
        never hide it<br />"Haha, thank you for your reminder, I will save your
        life in the future, goodbye!"<br /><br />Belokas smiled, and then
        disappeared directly in front of the two of them, and when he
        reappeared, he had already gone deep into the clouds and disappeared.<br /><br />...............<br /><br />At
        the same time, the cat fairy who was stroking his few whiskers was
        suddenly taken aback.<br /><br />"Meow! What is this little monster
        doing here? According to the speed, it will take less than 10
        minutes."<br /><br />"Well, anyway, he still obeys the rules, let's take
        a look first."<br /><br />The cat fairy pondered for a while and said,
        anyway, the person in front of him may not even be able to beat the
        gods, so what else can he do?<br /><br />Although the realm of the gods
        is very high, but the fighting power is indeed pitifully low<br /><br />What's
        more, he is not a complete Namekian yet.<br /><br />Whoosh, whoosh,
        whoosh, Belokas' figure kept flashing on the Kalin Tower, and after a
        while, he saw the top of the tower.<br /><br />"It seems that with my
        current combat power, climbing Kalin Tower is of little use."<br /><br />Belokas
        jumped into the top of the Kalin Tower, and the top of the tower was
        silent. Except for some necessary daily necessities, there was a bottle
        in the middle, which was the so-called super holy water, and the others
        were no different<br /><br />Belokas knew that the bottle was actually
        just boiled water, maybe it was left over from the old man Guixian
        hundreds of years ago!<br />The real super holy water is a poison that
        is too poisonous. If you drink it and you will not die, your strength
        will increase greatly. There are many people who have drank it, but from
        the beginning to the end, only Xiao Wukong succeeded.<br /><br />"Strange,
        where is the cat fairy? Could it be hiding?"<br /><br />Belokas looked
        around and said<br />"Huh? Those three big vats are..."<br /><br />Seeing
        the three large tanks leaning against the wall, Belokas seemed to
        remember something. He walked forward and opened the middle big tank,
        only to see that it was filled with water, showing the reflection of
        Belokas.<br /><br />Gululu, the water in the tank disappeared at a speed
        visible to the naked eye<br />"It really is that. These three big tanks
        represent the past, present and future respectively, taking care of a
        person's past, present and future"<br /><br />Then Belokas opened the
        past cylinder, and Belokas wanted to know how he crossed over<br /><br />"What...
        what? How could this be, I am actually the son of that person, and I had
        flashed [-] points of combat power when I was born."<br /><br />"But
        then I don't know what turned into a waste without combat effectiveness,
        and was sent to a planet at random, and it was because of this that I
        escaped the destruction of Planet Vegeta"<br /><br />"Perhaps I should
        have thought about it a long time ago. If it is an ordinary Saiyan, how
        can there be a battle suit and a detector when it is sent?"<br /><br />Seeing
        the picture in the middle, Belokas was very shocked. From the day he was
        reborn as a Saiyan, he only knew that he had become a Saiyan, and he
        didn't care about the others. Now he saw his life experience. Si is a
        little confused.<br /><br />"Forget it, now Planet Vegeta has been
        destroyed, this identity has no meaning, let's see what the future
        holds."<br /><br />Pa, Belokas opened the last big tank, only to see a
        blank space with no reflection.<br /><br />"Why not?"<br /><br />Just
        when Belokas was wondering, a soft sound came from behind, it was the
        cat fairy.<br /><br />"Hey, your fate is very strange. It seems that no
        one can control it. Your potential is also stronger than ever. I really
        didn't expect this race to exist."<br /><br />"Old cat, did you do it on
        purpose?" Belokas said with a serious face, his privacy was just known
        by... no, by a cat?<br />"Meow, you opened it yourself, it has nothing
        to do with me." The cat fairy wiped his paws and said with a harmless
        face<br /><br />"That's fine, I don't care about it, but I heard that as
        long as you climb the Kalin Tower, you will not only improve your
        strength, but you will also get something called fairy beans. You have
        so many tanks here, so I will take them One cylinder is ready"<br /><br />Without
        waiting for the cat fairy to say more, Belokas directly used his space
        talent to open the dimensional storage. At this point, he got a jar of
        fairy beans, and he was justified.<br /><br />There are at least tens of
        thousands of fairy beans in a tank, enough for Belokas to squander for a
        long time. You must know that these things became less and less in the
        Dragon Ball Z period, which made the later Z fighters want to use one as
        a few.<br /><br />Of course there is a need for the plot, but it is more
        about that bastard Yaqi Luobei, who actually eats the fairy beans as a
        meal, is a bastard and a prodigal son<br />.<br /><br />"Space ability?
        You are really shameless"<br /><br />Seeing this, Mao Xianren said
        helplessly that he had been storing it since 800 years ago. Although
        there are several tanks now, only one tank is gone.<br /><br />This mood
        is really...<br /><br />"Haha, are you shameless? Each other" Belokas
        laughed<br /><br />"By the way, I came here to study. Although my combat
        power is much higher than yours, my state is very poor."<br /><br />bellocastle
        road<br /><br />"Meow, haven't you already made a wish to Shenlong? Do
        you still need to come to me?"<br /><br />Apparently, the matter of the
        lower realms has not been hidden from this cat.<br /><br />"It's always
        good to have a sparring partner, isn't it?"<br /><br />To put it
        bluntly, I want a sandbag<br /><br />"Can you be more shameless?"<br /><br />The
        cat fairy twitched<br /><br />"Cat Fairy, just call me about this
        matter." At this time, an old voice sounded<br />(End of this chapter)

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
        Temple of Heaven, Belokas' Practice Method<br /><br />In the Temple of
        Heaven, Belokas and Piccolo looked at each other. Mr. Bobo, who was
        swarthy all over his body, would not be aware of his existence if he
        didn't look with his eyes.<br /><br />At least for now.<br /><br />Bobo,
        an existence older than the gods, does not know how many gods he has
        served. Similarly, his realm is terrifyingly high, and his strength is
        also unknown.<br /><br />There is nothing to say about being able to
        beat Xiao Wukong, maybe he only has a few hundred combat power, but in
        the Z period, he was able to take the attack of Trunks who could
        transform into a Super Saiyan at that time.<br /><br />This situation
        has to be said to be very suspicious.<br /><br />Similarly, the earth is
        also full of many unknowns. There are billions of planets in the
        universe, and there are countless planets with life.<br /><br />But
        there are not many gods on a planet, and the earth is one of them.<br /><br />Although
        this is only the lowest rank god.<br /><br />The Bagua Furnace of the
        Five Elements Mountain on the earth has the road to the underworld, the
        underworld of the underworld, which is the place in charge of the souls
        of life in the universe.<br /><br />Anyone who dies must report
        there.<br /><br />"Is the purpose of your coming to Earth just to
        cultivate?" Finally, the god Piccolo asked.<br /><br />For this unknown
        person in front of him, he must figure out everything, otherwise the
        consequences are not something he can bear, after all, this is the most
        powerful person he has ever seen since he was born<br />Even the gods of
        the previous generation can't compare<br /><br />"I won't let anyone
        destroy the planet," Bellocas said<br />Earth, what a distant and
        strange name, this blue planet carries too many memories of him, even
        though this earth is not that earth<br />But it is his only bond in this
        world<br /><br />Hearing this, the god Piccolo finally let go of his
        hanging heart. Although he didn't ask Belokas' purpose, it doesn't
        matter anymore<br /><br />As long as he doesn't cause any harm to the
        earth that's enough<br />"How many strong people like you are there in
        the universe?" asked Piccolo, the god of heaven<br /><br />As the god of
        the earth, there are some things he must ask clearly. If there are only
        one or two such strong men, it's okay. If...<br /><br />But Belokas'
        answer will definitely disappoint him. If a combat power of one thousand
        points is considered strong, then what is a guy with tens of thousands
        of combat power?<br /><br />"Stronger?" Belokas seemed to be mocking:
        "Judging from my current strength, I'm just a soy saucer."<br /><br />"Making
        soy sauce?"<br /><br />"It's just a miscellaneous soldier, maybe it
        won't even count as a miscellaneous soldier," Bellocas said<br />In
        fact, this is indeed the case. A combat power of [-] is equivalent to
        that of a cultivator. That kind of thing is just cannon fodder.<br /><br />The
        shock of the god Piccolo can be seen through his eyes, and Belokas said
        again: "But it will not be soon, I am confident that one of the
        strongest in the universe in the future will definitely be me."<br /><br />Hearing
        this, God Piccolo said: "Youth is the greatest asset. Many people have
        great power but don't know how to use it rationally. You are like
        this."<br /><br />"If you get good guidance, your combat power will grow
        very well. Okay, let me see your strength, so that I can better arrange
        training for you."<br /><br />"Ok"<br /><br />Belokas responded, and
        then clenched his hands tightly into fists, exuding a powerful aura<br />"what!!"<br /><br />Belokas
        let out a roar as if he was constipated, and white flames rose all over
        his body. Under this strong pressure, Piccolo, the god of heaven, had to
        back away.<br /><br />"Enough...Enough...Stop"<br /><br />God Piccolo
        shouted<br />"Huh~" Bellocas breathed out and stopped.<br />"I probably
        know your combat power. Compared with your combat power, I have seen
        your bottomless potential."<br /><br />"I will add clothes with ten
        times the gravity to you now, and you only need to listen to Bobo for
        the next training."<br /><br />"Ten times? Wait a minute" Bellocas
        stopped<br />"What's wrong?" Piccolo asked.<br /><br />Is ten times too
        much?<br /><br />"I was born on a planet with ten times the gravity, so
        ten times the gravity doesn't do much for me, but I want to go to the
        'spiritual time room' before I go again"<br /><br />"Don't worry, I just
        want to practice a set of boxing techniques. It will take a month or two
        at most. In that way, the speed of my practice will increase a lot. If I
        add ten times the gravity now, it will become a hundred times by then. ,
        I can't stand that."<br /><br />Belokas said, one hundred times the
        gravity, Sun Wukong was no more than that when he went to Namek, how can
        the current Belokas bear it?<br /><br />Just this boxing?What kind of
        boxing is it worth using the spiritual time room like this? You must
        know that everyone only has two chances in a lifetime. Is it the Kaiwang
        boxing?or something else<br /><br />"That's it, Bobo, take him to the
        house of spirit and time," Piccolo said.<br />Next, under the leadership
        of Bobo, entered the spiritual time room<br />Spiritual Time House, a
        big cheating tool in Dragon Ball, one year inside is equal to one day
        outside, very suitable for those who are about to break through<br />There
        is only one downside, and that is that a person can only use it twice in
        a lifetime<br /><br />But this shortcoming can be broken with great
        power, that power belongs to the power of Super Saiyan III<br /><br />"This
        is the legendary spiritual time house. The space in it is
        unprecedentedly solid. It has many similarities with my dimensional
        space. The gravity is the same as that of Planet Vegeta."<br /><br />"The
        air is thin and hot, the temperature is between fifty degrees Celsius
        and minus forty degrees Celsius, and there is a vast space like the
        earth; weak will and lack of concentration are prone to
        hallucinations"<br /><br />"This is indeed a veritable gold medal
        training place, but I just need the time here for the time being."<br /><br />...........................<br /><br />Spiritual
        time outside<br /><br />"God"<br /><br />"Bobo, the universe is so vast.
        I have a feeling that the earth will face one disaster after another in
        the near future."<br /><br />"I am very aware of my own strength, not to
        mention that as a god, I can't follow suit. For the future of the earth,
        we need new power"<br /><br />"So, please trouble Bobo to train him
        carefully, he is a person with great potential"<br /><br />"God rest
        assured, Bobo understands"<br /><br />………………<br /><br />About two hours
        later, the door of the spiritual time room was reopened with a creak,
        and the originally intact combat uniform had already become
        dilapidated.<br /><br />His body was even more blue and purple, and the
        corner of his eye turned into a panda eye<br />How is this going?This
        was obviously beaten by someone, but Belokas was the only person who
        entered the spiritual time room. Could it be that there were others?<br /><br />Wait,
        no, the aura on Belokas is much weaker than before<br /><br />Just when
        Bobo was puzzled, he only heard a few slaps, and Belokas was completely
        exposed.<br />One belokas, two belokas, three belokas, four belokas.<br /><br />All
        four are belokas, same hairstyle, same tail<br />"It turned out to be
        like this, one mind and four functions, four bodies and one mind - four
        body boxing, Belokas, you are really a genius"<br /><br />God Piccolo
        said in a daze<br />That's right, it's the four-body punch. This is one
        of the tricks that Belokas has cultivated in the past two months.<br /><br />Four
        body boxing, people often say that one mind and two purposes, four body
        boxing is one mind and four purposes.<br /><br />Can separate three
        bodies that are the same as themselves<br />There are two kinds of
        Sishenquan, one is the first generation of Sishenquan, which is the
        first generation of Sishenquan used in the confrontation between Tianjin
        Fan and Wukong<br /><br />Although the first generation of Sishenquan
        had no dead ends in attacking, it divided a person's strength into four
        parts. This is an important shortcoming.<br />The second generation of
        Four-body Fist is the Perfect Four-body Fist developed by Sha Ru. The
        Perfect Four-body Fist solves the shortcoming of dividing the power into
        four parts after the clone. The power after the clone is the same as
        before the clone.<br /><br />Although it is perfect, it also has
        shortcomings, that is, it cannot withstand the blows of others (for
        details, please refer to the chapter of Dragon Ball Z Cell).<br /><br />"God
        is overwhelmed. I have too much to learn. It is much more convenient for
        four people to study together than one person."<br /><br />Belokas said
        with a smile, although the disadvantages of four-body boxing are
        obvious, but when they are also disadvantages, they are also
        advantages<br /><br />In short, in one sentence, things are not
        absolute, they will be transformed into each other under certain
        conditions<br /><br />Four-body fist is naturally not good for fighting,
        but it is the best opponent for cultivation<br />It may be easy to
        surpass others, but it is more difficult to surpass yourself<br /><br />The
        enemy who knows you best is the enemy, but why don't you know yourself,
        the premise is that you are honest enough to yourself?<br /><br />"Okay,
        god, please give us four plus twenty times the gravity, I want to climb
        Kalin Tower again"<br /><br />At the same time, the cat fairy not far
        away shivered.<br />"Meow, I seem to have a bad feeling"<br /><br />(End
        of this chapter)
        <p></p>

        <h2>Chapter 5</h2>
        Absolute crisis! ! !<br />Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, under the
        astonishment of Upa and his son, the two figures kept climbing up the
        Kalin Tower, and ran to a far away place, and then climbed up Kalin
        Tower with many things from a far away place. Linta<br /><br />The two
        figures went back and forth from one day at the beginning to one hour
        back and forth now, the hardships can be imagined.<br /><br />bang,
        bang, bang<br /><br />Fish with strange shapes, seen before, never seen
        before, poisonous and non-poisonous, scattered in front of the cat fairy
        like raindrops<br />"Belokas, the speed is too slow this time, and look,
        this is a puffer fish, how do you tell me to eat it?" The cat fairy
        poked a puffer fish road on the ground with the crutch in his hand.<br />"Huh~huh"
        Belokas gasped and said, "At the beginning you said that you only need
        fish, but now you pay with one hand and deliver the goods with the
        other. Bring ten fairy beans!"<br /><br />"Old cat, I don't think you
        will renege on your debt?"<br /><br />another belocas added<br /><br />"Meow,
        it's really unlucky for eight lifetimes to meet you, here you are!" the
        Cat Immortal threw out ten fairy beans and said.<br /><br />"Your
        arithmetic was taught by the physical education teacher? Ten per
        person"<br /><br />Bellocas emphasized that<br /><br />"Aren't you
        alone?"<br /><br />The cat fairy's lips twitched like I don't
        understand<br /><br />"Well, it seems that I have to teach you how to be
        an honest and trustworthy person... no more cats"<br /><br />The two
        Belokas twisted their necks, shook their hands, and there was a crisp
        sound like fried beans.<br /><br />"Meow!!!"<br /><br />Afterwards, I
        only heard the screams of the Cat Immortal, and I no longer have to
        worry about not being able to catch it, and I can finally deal with this
        cat severely.<br /><br />...............<br /><br />In the Temple of
        Heaven, the same two figures are intertwined with each other, and the
        battle continues<br /><br />"Kurtle...pai...qi...gong"<br /><br />"Wave………"<br /><br />A
        huge blue light wave shot out from Belokas' hand, hitting Bobo
        directly<br />Unexpectedly, Bobo Bobo didn't move, and directly took a
        big mouthful of the Kameha Qigong Bobo issued by Belokas, and Bobo
        directly ate it all.<br /><br />"Huh~ Bobo, you are really good. Your
        realm is too high, so high that I can't imagine it. I admit that the
        same level is not your opponent, but I don't want to lose."<br /><br />"As
        long as you can be as silent as the sky and faster than lightning, you
        can defeat Bobo, otherwise the result will be the same no matter how
        many times you try."<br /><br />"Hey, Bobo is like this?"<br /><br />Belokas
        suddenly smiled, and the whole person became extremely quiet, as if
        blending into the heaven and the earth, even if the collapse of the sky
        and the earth cannot affect my heart, it seems to see the way ahead, and
        the trajectory of everything can't escape my eyes.<br /><br />Belokas,
        who was in three places at the same time, suddenly changed his
        momentum<br /><br />The four bodies are one body, one mind and four
        functions, and there is a strong induction between them. This kind of
        induction is no problem even across the ends of the earth.<br /><br />In
        the invisible world, the farthest and closest distance is the heart!<br />"You
        are the most talented person Bobo has ever met"<br /><br />Bobo still
        looked calm, but there was a little shock and approval in the depths of
        his eyes<br /><br />In the past three months, Belokas has not only
        adapted to twenty times the gravity, but also has more refined control
        of Qi, although he hasn't grown much taller.<br /><br />No way, the
        infancy of pure Saiyans is indeed quite long<br /><br />Taking advantage
        of the four-body boxing, Belokas obtained four times the cultivation
        results by converting four into one, and increased his combat power by
        about [-] points since he came out of the spiritual time room.<br /><br />After
        being divided into four, each has a combat power of 320 and five points,
        but when adding twenty times the gravity, it is only about one hundred
        points.<br /><br />Of course, it's just that the strength is restrained,
        not disappearing. If the strength is low, it will be easy to control,
        and the four of them will naturally learn quickly.<br /><br />Up to now,
        each clone has about [-] points of combat power, and the total is [-]
        points of combat power.<br /><br />It has increased by [-] points from
        the beginning, but it is not enough to make him proud. Leaving aside
        Broly's freak, it is only said that Vegeta's combat power in the same
        period has reached tens of thousands, not to mention that there is
        another one on this earth. Sun Wukong<br />Even though Sun Wukong is
        weak at this time, Belokas never dared to underestimate him, because
        anyone who is surpassed by him can only follow behind him for the rest
        of his life, and there will be no chance of surpassing him.<br /><br />Tao
        Baibai, the number one killer at first, followed by Tianjin Fan, and
        then Piccolo. In the Z period, Vegeta was like this, and so was Son
        Gohan, who once surpassed the protagonist, and the last Majin Buu was
        also like this. .<br /><br />It’s okay to have Saiyan blood, but the
        rest of the Z fighters have all become soy saucers. Belokas is a time
        traveler after all.<br /><br />If he is surpassed by the protagonist, he
        can't afford to lose that person!<br /><br />"Okay, let's move on to
        Bobo, ha!!"<br /><br />click, click, click<br />Belokas disappeared
        instantly, and appeared in front of Bobo in the blink of an eye<br />Belokas
        punched out, but suddenly the figure of Belokas stopped<br /><br />Hearing
        a bang, Belokas suddenly flew upside down<br />Obviously hit again by
        Bobo<br />But why?<br />"Belokas, what happened?" Popo walked in front
        of Belokas and asked<br /><br />If it wasn't for the meal just now, he
        would have been beaten by Bobo<br />"Why... how could this happen, how
        could that guy be born now, the time is not right"<br /><br />"Could it
        be that this is the butterfly effect brought about by me? But it
        shouldn't be, he can't be born without the power of Shenlong"<br /><br />I
        saw Belokas muttering to himself with a shocked face, and at the same
        time the two Belokas in Kalinta were also extremely shocked<br /><br />"Bobo,
        a powerful enemy has appeared on Earth"<br /><br />Belokas threw down a
        sentence and flew directly to the bottom of Kalin Tower<br /><br />"Enemy?"
        Bobo was shocked.<br /><br />How strong should Belokas be called an
        enemy?<br />In less than half a minute, Belokas came to the top of the
        Kalin Tower, and then saw three Belokas merged into one, and a powerful
        force radiated out<br /><br />Swish, swish, swish, bang<br /><br />Belokas
        ignited white flames all over his body like a launcher, and immediately
        went north<br />"Damn it, if I knew it would be like this, I would have
        learned teleportation first!!"<br /><br />"If that's the case, there is
        no one on Earth who will be his opponent"<br /><br />"including me"<br /><br />.....................<br /><br />At
        the same time, in the remote Mount Zir Mezpri, the heavy snow on this
        mountain is said to never melt no matter how hot it is, known as the
        Eternal Ice Wall<br /><br />However, Belokas, who was here, frowned,<br /><br />Sishenquan
        is divided into four, two are climbing Kalin Tower, one is in the Temple
        of Heaven, and the other naturally came below<br />Wukong and Lubelokas
        want to try it again<br /><br />I saw what should have been a frozen
        area, but now it has turned into a vast ocean<br /><br />And from the
        melting ice walls revealed a huge fortress<br />This place, this scene,
        is very familiar to a Dragon Ball fan traveler, the familiarity cannot
        be more familiar<br /><br />It is said that two scientific geniuses
        appeared on the earth decades ago<br /><br />Dr. Willow and his
        assistant, Dr. Ketai<br />Due to non-human research, he was condemned by
        God and was permanently frozen in this eternal ice wall<br />But one day
        his assistant, Dr. Kotai, gathered seven dragon balls and made a wish to
        melt the eternal ice wall, and released Willow Bo, who attempted to
        seize the body of the strongest human being.<br />In the end, it was
        given seconds by Sun Wukong with vitality bombs<br />This is the
        theatrical version of Dragon Ball - The Strongest Man in the World, the
        plot inside<br /><br />You must know that Monkey King at that time had
        already learned the Realm King Fist, with a normal fighting power of
        [-], and when he gathered [-] fighting power, he used the Out of the
        Realm King Fist to have a fighting power of [-].<br />But even so, he
        was still defeated in the end, and he used his hole card—the vitality
        bomb<br />Although the theatrical version and the timeline of Dragon
        Ball itself do not match, the combat power is similar<br />Today,
        Belokas' combat power can reach up to two thousand<br />He——Belokas, the
        most powerful person on earth right now, what should he do?<br /><br />(End
        of this chapter)
        <p></p>

        <h2>Chapter 6</h2>
        Bellocas' Hole Card<br /><br />Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh, I saw four
        figures quickly surrounding Belokas. I took a closer look at the four
        figures in front of me. Although they were similar to the cultivator,
        their combat power was not 01:30 worse than the original version.<br /><br />Because
        in the original book, even Gui Xianren can beat them up<br /><br />Of
        course, it's a different matter if it's a few other cyborgs<br /><br />"Please
        come with us!" one of them issued a mechanical order<br />"Cut, it's
        just four copycats, how dare you be so rampant?"<br /><br />Belokas
        pre-empted the attack, stepped out and the whole person ejected like a
        cannonball<br />brush!<br />I saw Belokas attacking the four cottages in
        an instant by transforming into four and transforming into four
        figures.<br /><br />The four copycats were not to be outdone, and each
        punched one of Belokas, but only heard a bang<br /><br />Boom, one of
        the counterfeit cultivators was directly blown away by Belokas, while
        the remaining three didn't even touch Belokas' clothes<br />This move is
        the advanced use of Afterimage Fist<br /><br />Multiple afterimage
        punches, for opponents who cannot sense qi, this is an excellent trick
        to confuse people<br /><br />After all, this Belokas in front of him is
        just one of his avatars, and with his current ability, it is impossible
        to reach the point where he can do everything with one mind.<br /><br />Belokas
        flew into the air in one go, and the remaining three counterfeit
        cultivators followed<br />"what!!"<br /><br />Belokas turned around and
        instantly fired several energy bombs in his hand<br />boom! boom!
        boom!<br />After a bang under Belokas' fierce attack, piles of scrap
        iron were seen falling from the sky<br /><br />"Hmph, it really is just
        a pile of scrap copper and rotten iron"<br /><br />Seeing this, Belokas
        pouted and said<br />"Ok?"<br /><br />Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh<br /><br />At
        this moment, three figures attacked him again, and Belokas felt three
        pains in front of him.<br />The lower abdomen, the back of the head, and
        the spine were hit hard by someone, followed by a faint, and the eyes
        quickly went dark<br /><br />"Bastard, the avatar was caught so quickly,
        it seems that the real power of those biochemical humans cannot be
        underestimated"<br /><br />Belokas, who was on the way, cursed, and then
        speeded up<br />.....................<br /><br />Beep beep, inside the
        fortress, a series of data is being displayed on the huge screen, I
        don't know what is being calculated<br /><br />At this time, Belokas
        woke up faintly, and saw that he was in the darkness, with many wires
        tied to his body, and his limbs were also fixed.<br /><br />Belokas
        moved, and finally found that he couldn't use any force at all. Belokas
        recalled the moment before he fainted<br /><br />'Unexpectedly, the way
        to play for Piccolo is now my turn'<br /><br />Bellocas Secret
        Passage<br />Piccolo, the once-frightening villain, a charismatic
        warrior<br />But in the theatrical version, the enemy is often the first
        to take the knife<br />That kind of situation is often a sneak attack,
        and with the addition of group fights, the final result is loss<br />Outsiders
        seem to have been killed<br />Then, the enemy said, "Is this the big
        devil Piccolo? It's not very good."<br /><br />When I first watched the
        movie, I looked down on this practice, but today it fell on Belokas<br /><br />Pretending
        to be someone else's guinea pig<br />This mood is really... He's so
        fucking upset<br /><br />If you don't get back your face, it will be
        difficult to be a man in the future!<br />He has never heard of any
        Saiyan being captured as a guinea pig<br />Clap, clap, a burst of
        applause came, and the surrounding lights suddenly lit up<br /><br />"He
        woke up really fast. He is indeed the person with the most potential in
        the world, but his current combat power is weaker."<br /><br />"Dr.
        Ketai?" Bellocas said<br />"I didn't expect that after so many years,
        there are still people who know me. It's a great honor." Dr. Ketai
        revealed a disgusting smile.<br />"Tch, just because of your ugly face
        and bald head, especially your self-righteous eyes, you can't even
        recognize it, but I'm curious how you broke through the eternal ice
        wall?"<br /><br />Bellocas asked<br />"Hehe, how can stupid human beings
        understand the greatness of God? Especially a low-level creature like
        you with well-developed limbs, you don't deserve to have this body," Dr.
        Ketai said<br />"The body with the most potential should be matched with
        a god-like brain"<br /><br />"God? I don't know who the god you're
        talking about. If you're referring to Dr. Willow, he's just a poor
        wretch lingering on his last breath." Bellocas said disdainfully<br />"Hmph,
        Dr. Willow is the closest person to God. With your body, it will be a
        matter of time before you surpass God." Dr. Ketai snorted coldly.<br />It
        seems that the power of the god made him very afraid<br /><br />"Haha,
        god? Although I don't know who the god you are talking about is, I
        really can't think of a guy who has given up his human body and has the
        ability to become a god." Belokas said<br />"Hmph, how can a small
        mortal see the greatness of the sky? The brains of our geniuses are no
        longer what a human body can carry."<br /><br />"In order to keep up
        with our thinking, I originally wanted to find the strongest Wutian
        teacher, but your appearance made me see the incomparable potential.
        Accepting your fate obediently can make you suffer less."<br /><br />Dr.
        Ketai pressed the switch button in his hand, and a strong current spread
        throughout Belokas' body.<br /><br />"Hehe, do you think you can trap me
        with your rags?"<br /><br />Belokas sneered, although he can't use
        force, it doesn't mean he can't use other<br />"drink!!"<br /><br />Belokas
        yelled loudly, and a powerful aura quickly burst out of his body<br /><br />"This
        is...how could this be?"<br /><br />Belokas was startled, the Qi that
        should have been gathered in his hands was passing away for some
        reason<br /><br />"Haha, stupid guy, do you think I didn't consider
        this? This is the result of you underestimating me, Dr. Ketai, so feel
        free to be Willow's body."<br /><br />Dr. Ketai's face is full of
        disdain but seems to show off, and the saliva he spews when he speaks
        makes people want to vomit<br />"Heh, do you think you won? I didn't
        want to use this trick at first, ha!!" Belokas sneered, mobilized the Qi
        in his body again, and a powerful force passed away just like last
        time<br /><br />"Hmph, dying"<br /><br />Dr. Ketai snorted coldly, in
        his opinion this was the same as last time, but it was just an act of
        hypocrisy.<br /><br />"It's almost time, the space bomb, explode!!"<br /><br />Boom
        boom boom, just listen to Belokas' order, and the sound of countless
        explosions quickly resounded around<br />The castle disappeared in the
        blink of an eye<br />"What's going on here? Well, Dr. Willow, how are
        you?" Dr. Ketai quickly ran to a robot with a brain and asked<br /><br />but
        no response<br /><br />"That guy is really strong enough. He was hit by
        my space blasting bomb and fell into a short-term frustration."<br /><br />Belokas
        walked slowly towards Dr. Ketai<br />Space Explosive Bomb: The trick
        developed by Belokas, space is everywhere, any narrow object has space,
        automatically finds the fragile place of space, uses powerful force to
        collapse, and moves the whole body with one blow, so as to complete huge
        damage<br />This is one of his cards<br />"You... what are you going to
        do?"<br /><br />Dr. Ketai looked horrified<br /><br />"Hehe, what are
        you doing? Your filthy behavior made me sick, and my self-righteous
        thoughts made me see a person who is even more stupid than an idiot."<br /><br />"Have
        human thoughts, use human skin, but in the end, you are idle and
        cumbersome, and you make yourself into a ghost, and you are
        self-righteous and get eternal life"<br /><br />"A person like you...
        no, something that is not as good as a beast. If you die, you will go to
        hell to flatter you, and your soul will be your destination."<br /><br />Belokas
        said dissatisfied<br />"Bastard, I'll fight with you!!" Dr. Ketai
        quickly removed his human disguise, and a robot appeared in front of
        him<br /><br />Tatata, countless bullets hit Belokas like free money<br /><br />"Because
        you don't have that qualification"<br /><br />Kacha, after the words
        fell, Belokas' fist had pierced his chest, and then a qigong wave was
        launched, and Dr. Ketai instantly turned into a pile of scrap iron.<br /><br />　I

        <h2>Chapter 7</h2>
        I am neither Goku nor Vegeta<br /><br />"For Dr. Willow, tell me God's
        message and you'll get a happy ending"<br /><br />Bellocas said in front
        of Dr. Willow<br /><br />god?Who is he?God of destruction, he's still
        asleep!Kaiwangshen?He's still bothered by Majin Buu<br />This
        never-before-seen character made him very uneasy, it was beyond his
        control<br /><br />What are the advantages of the traversers?He is
        familiar with history. If history changes, he will lose his advantage,
        so he never changes history, and never regards himself as the
        protagonist<br />because that would be a terrible death<br />As for Dr.
        Willow in front of him, he is indeed very powerful, and his combat power
        may be around [-]<br />But so what?He, Belokas, still has cards he
        hasn't used yet.<br /><br />"An ant dares to talk to me like that, I
        really don't know where you got the courage from?"<br /><br />"You three
        get him for me"<br /><br />Dr. Willow gave an order to the remaining
        three cyborgs<br />And he doesn't seem to want to make a move easily,
        maybe it's not yet the critical moment<br /><br />The same is true in
        the original book. Although there is an extremely powerful aura, it is
        just the aura he has accumulated over the years.<br />He is not a pure
        warrior, this is his Achilles' heel<br /><br />Snapped!When Belokas took
        off the gravity suit on his body, a big hole was smashed on the
        ground<br /><br />Belokas felt an unprecedented ease and strength<br />click!click!<br />Belokas
        moved his body and squeezed his fist as if enjoying the joy of power<br /><br />"Three
        miscellaneous fish, send you back to the west!"<br /><br />While
        speaking, Belokas stepped out, and the four of them fought together for
        a while<br /><br />boom!boom!boom<br /><br />boom!boom!boom<br /><br />Even
        with one enemy and three, Belokas is still able to do a job with ease,
        and the energy bombs in his hand are constantly emitting pieces of
        scorched earth on the ground.<br />The opponent is not to be outdone
        either, with Apple's Freezing Punch, Chisimei's Electric Shock, and the
        pig-like Misogaz<br />Although this guy is not flexible enough and the
        combat effectiveness is not high, but the whole body is very strong in
        fighting. Not only did it rebound the Kamepai Qigong of the Guixianren,
        but even Monkey King used the Kaiwangquan.<br /><br />"Hehe, this is the
        biochemical warrior? Stupid as a pig"<br /><br />Belokas sneered and
        punched Misogaz<br />Misogaz dismissed this, he was confident that no
        one could hurt him<br />"Roar!!"<br /><br />But in the next second,
        Misogaz roared in pain, his eyes tearing open.<br />I saw a lightsaber
        directly piercing his abdomen, and the next second the lightsaber
        disappeared and Misogaz deflated like a balloon<br /><br />This is
        exactly Vegetto's trick - the lightsaber<br /><br />To deal with this
        kind of thing, it is natural to drop one thing from another. Needle is
        naturally used to deal with balloons, and scissors are naturally used to
        cut cloth.<br /><br />By brute force?It's only a Saiyan with
        well-developed limbs who can do things like - Napa<br /><br />In this
        regard, Belokas said that he is an intelligent Saiyan<br />Click!Click!click<br /><br />Belokas
        felt a chill, and a thick layer of ice formed all over his body.<br /><br />"Haha,
        I think you are really stupid. If you don't kill yourself, you still
        have a chance to survive. If you planted Appleberry's freezing punch,
        you can only obediently be my body." Dr. Willow laughed.<br />"is
        it?"<br /><br />Belokas showed a nonchalant smile<br />"Hmph, Chisimei
        knocked him out for me."<br /><br />Dr. Willow gave an order, and
        Chisime rushed towards Belokas like a mad bull.<br /><br />boom!I saw
        that when Qisimei's fist was still a piece of paper away from Belokas,
        two puffs of blue smoke came out from the back of his head<br /><br />Then
        fell to the ground lifelessly<br />At this time, Belokas' eyeballs just
        flashed a little red.<br /><br />This is Piccolo's trick. Although I
        don't know what it's called, Belokas gave it a name-Magic Eye Laser<br /><br />In
        the original book, this trick caused Xiao Wukong to lose a pair of legs
        and a hand, but now Belokas shoots the enemy's eyes directly<br /><br />Enemy
        one hit kill<br /><br />!<br /><br />For the rest of Aprilia, her legs
        trembled with fear and now she doesn't know what to do.<br /><br />He's
        just a cyborg, with only beast-like instincts, he knows how to be
        afraid<br /><br />Whoosh!At this moment, a red light mercilessly passed
        through Aprilia's chest<br />"Hmph, useless trash, I didn't expect to
        deal with you, an ant, and I would have to do it myself in the end." Dr.
        Willow snorted coldly.<br />"Old man, it's hard to say who will be the
        ants later," Bellocas said<br />"You can't move now, not to mention that
        you are already at the end of your strength, what else can you do?"<br /><br />"Let
        me take over your body, rest assured that it will be developed like
        never before, and will follow me in the universe in the future"<br /><br />Dr.
        Willow was a little proud, as if he had seen the scene where he ruled
        the universe<br />In comparison, Bellocas can only say: "The frog in the
        well doesn't know what it means"<br /><br />He is indeed at the end of
        his strength, sending space blasting bombs, using a lightsaber, and
        finally using the magic pupil laser, many tricks are not available to
        him at this level<br /><br />Especially the eye pupil laser and the
        space blasting bomb, one needs the blood of the demon race, and the
        other needs a lot of energy, it is not easy to survive until now<br />"Stupid
        mortal, it will be the greatest honor in my life to let me, Dr. Willow,
        send you on your journey"<br /><br />Dr. Willow raised his mechanical
        hand high and mercilessly smashed at Belokas<br />'Damn it, is it really
        too late?Ok?coming'<br /><br />"Turtle...pai...qi...gong"<br /><br />"Wave………"<br /><br />Hearing
        a loud roar, a blue qigong wave hit Dr. Willow at the same time, his
        body parted, and Belokas smiled and disappeared.<br /><br />"Who? Damn
        it!" Dr. Willow cursed and avoided Kamehae<br /><br />Rumbling, the blue
        beam of light blasted towards the mountain peak not far away, stirring
        up a burst of dust for a while<br /><br />At the same time, Belokas
        wiped the sweat from his head and said,<br /><br />"Phew, it's a good
        thing I came in time, otherwise I will suffer a lot of losses in my
        practice these days. It seems that it is necessary to learn the skill of
        teleportation."<br /><br />That's right, Belokas, who dared to come from
        the Temple of Heaven, returned to the main body in one in ten thousand
        cases, and now he is a four-in-one<br /><br />No longer a weak chicken
        with only a few hundred points of combat power before<br />"Look at
        this, the fighting power of this damn thing is around [-], I haven't
        been this excited for a long time"<br /><br />"However, with my current
        strength of less than [-], I am no match for him anyway. It seems that I
        have to play my hole card."<br /><br />"It's just that the fun of
        fighting will be much less"<br /><br />Belokas greeted Dr. Willow not
        far away<br /><br />"Yo! Old guy, you are good at escaping. Now I will
        give you one last chance to say the message of 'God'. You can live for a
        few more seconds."<br /><br />"What? How is this possible, how can your
        power..."<br /><br />Facing Dr. Bellocaswillo, he was surprised, and
        then said:<br />"Hmph, no matter how much strength you have increased,
        you cannot be my opponent"<br /><br />After all, Dr. Willow rushed to
        Bellocas desperately<br /><br />"Hmph! Stubbornness"<br /><br />Belokas
        swallowed a fairy bean, and then used four body punches again, another
        Belokas appeared, this time there were only two people<br />The two
        Belokas looked at Dr. Willow and smiled calmly, and then saw a set of
        strange dance steps unfolded<br /><br />"Hoo... Fusion... Fusion..."<br /><br />When
        the fingertips of the two Belokas touched each other, a powerful energy
        field instantly enveloped the two Belokas, and then only the light was
        shining, and a strong and terrifying aura rolled in.<br />The Guixianren
        who was far away in the Guixian House suddenly dropped the lewd books in
        his hand, and said with a big face change<br /><br />"Na... Nani? How
        can there be such a powerful person in the world?"<br /><br />Even with
        his high level, he couldn't help but tremble all over<br /><br />Little
        Wukong, who was training not far away, seemed to feel this familiar
        atmosphere. He was exhausted, and he didn't know where the strength came
        from to practice even harder.<br />The cat fairy far away in Kalinta
        stuttered with his cat eyes wide open.<br />"This... is this... what
        kind of trick?"<br /><br />"What kind of power is this? Fortunately, the
        original decision was correct."<br /><br />Piccolo, the god of the
        Temple of Heaven, couldn't calm down anymore, his decision was indeed
        right<br /><br />The light dissipated, and a warrior in national
        costume, who looked exactly like a replica of Gogeta, appeared in front
        of me with raging white arrogance.<br /><br />He, or Belokas, saw him
        with a weird smile and said<br />"I'm neither Goku nor Vegeta, I'm the
        one who's going to hit you!!"<br /><br />(End of this chapter)
        <p></p>

        <h2>Chapter 8</h2>
        Fusion and Fusion, Ultimate Dragon Ball<br />"I am neither Goku nor
        Vegeta, I am the one who will defeat you!"<br /><br />For ordinary
        people, this is just a very common sentence<br />But for a true Dragon
        Ball fan, it's an uplifting quote<br /><br />Because this is what the
        once invincible second combined fighter said<br />He is Gogeta, even
        though the words are precious, but every sentence is true.<br />His
        arrogance, his calmness, his kindness, and his charming smile at the
        end, everything shows his invincible self-confidence<br />He Belokas,
        although he is not a narcissist, but he cares most about his
        appearance<br />Without it, because Belokas looks too much like
        Gogeta<br /><br />Because of this, Belokas has never lost since the day
        he was born, no matter who the enemy is!<br />All this is because Gogeta
        left him too deeply, even if he only stays for a moment, he shines like
        a shooting star<br />In the dark night sky, his light is stronger than
        the sun<br />"The number... the data value has reached one... one
        million...how is this possible??"<br /><br />Bang, the transparent
        substance covering Dr. Willow's brain shattered like glass<br /><br />"Dr.
        Willow, you can push me to this point, and make me deny that you are
        indeed an extremely rare scientific genius"<br /><br />"But... the game
        between us is over. After all, I don't have much time. It is your honor
        to die under this kind of power."<br /><br />While speaking, Belokas put
        his hands on his waist, and the energy ball of Kamehae Qigong slowly
        formed<br />"Bastard, it's impossible...impossible...if that's the case,
        then I will destroy the earth"<br /><br />Dr. Willow drove the
        mechanical body like a madman into a meteor and flew into the
        atmosphere<br />boom! ! !<br />The qi accumulated for decades was
        instantly released by Dr. Willow, and a burst of red energy rushed
        towards the earth like the sky<br />"Turtle...pai...qi...gong..."<br /><br />"Wave………"<br /><br />Compared
        with Belokas, who is happy and fearless, he hits the Kamepae Qigong wave
        in his hand.<br />An unprecedented beam of light hit Dr. Willow's red
        qigong wave<br />The gap between the two is absolute, and there is no
        suspense. Everything is so devastated under Belocas' Kamehae<br />"Asshole...no...may...possible"<br /><br />Seeing
        the Kamehae Qigong rushing towards him, Dr. Willow let out a hysterical
        growl of unwillingness<br />But it's all in vain<br />When it was
        completely submerged by Kamepai Qigong, it had already turned into a
        cloud of fly ash...<br /><br />no... not even smoke<br />Maybe it's a
        particle, maybe it's an atom<br /><br />At this moment everything is
        gone<br /><br />"Hehe, the time is just right, it's really tiring"<br /><br />Belokas
        murmured, at this moment, he had lost all the aura he had just now,
        lying on the ground like mud, even an ordinary person could kill him<br />But
        this is not a problem, in the next second, Belokas put a fairy bean in
        his mouth, and then he heard two clicks, and Belokas returned to his
        peak<br />"Xiandou is really a good thing, the power of fusion is really
        powerful..."<br /><br />Fusion, a big move in the world of Dragon Ball,
        Belokas' second hole card<br /><br />The former fusion fighter Gotenks
        faintly overwhelmed the second form of Majin Buu<br />The former
        ultimate warrior Gogeta killed the evil wave whose strength was still
        above Super Three with one move<br />The ultimate form of Super Four
        Seasons used to beat the Super One Star Dragon unable to lift its
        head<br />But now Belokas has also mastered the skill of fusion, and one
        person can also launch<br /><br />Four-body boxing plus fusion equals
        super warrior<br />This is what Belokas had fantasized about before
        traveling, and it began to be implemented after Belokas made a wish to
        the dragon<br /><br />Of course, Belokas' fusion is very different from
        the original, because one's fusion has a lot less power in the base<br />Fusion
        is very similar to fusion, but if fusion is better than fusion, Belokas
        knows the difference after making a wish<br />Fusion - Combat power is
        multiplied, and fusion is also combat power multiplied<br />But fusion
        requires that the aura between two people must be consistent, if your
        combat power is 5 and the other is 3<br />Then the strong must
        accommodate the weak, and the result will be three times three, and the
        fit should not consider this issue, just three times five<br /><br />This
        is the difference between fusion and fusion, the strong are stronger and
        the weak are weaker<br /><br />And Belokas's fusion is different from
        the two, because of his four-body boxing support, and his state can only
        last for 30 seconds instead of half an hour<br /><br />Belokas, who took
        off the 100 times the gravity, increased his combat power to two
        thousand, one thousand after the avatar, and one million combat power
        after the fusion<br />Much better than Frieza's first form<br /><br />It
        can be said that this is the second biggest gain after Belokas came to
        the earth<br /><br />........................<br /><br />In the Temple
        of Heaven, seeing that Belokas returned safely, the enemy was completely
        wiped out, the god Piccolo was completely relieved<br />"Belokas, I
        would like to thank you on behalf of the earth. I never thought that
        there would be people on earth who could reach this level."<br /><br />"If
        it wasn't for you this time, the earth would really be destroyed"<br /><br />God
        Piccolo bowed to Bellocas<br />"Haha, God, you're welcome. I said that
        no one is allowed to destroy the earth. This is my promise." Belokas
        scratched his head and said<br />"You did save the planet anyway, by the
        way, what are you going to do next?"<br /><br />The god Piccolo asked,
        since Belokas has such a combat power now, it probably doesn't make much
        sense here<br /><br />"I plan to practice here for a while, and then go
        to the World's No. [-] Martial Arts Conference soon."<br /><br />"By the
        way, God, I want to ask if there is the ultimate dragon ball here?"
        Belokas asked<br /><br />"Ultimate Dragon Balls? If you mean the set of
        Dragon Balls I made before, it does exist"<br /><br />God Piccolo said,
        and then he seemed to think of something to say to Belokas<br /><br />"The
        power of the ultimate dragon ball is far higher than that of the green
        dragon, but after that set of dragon balls is used up, it will fly to
        the entire universe. If it can't be found within a year, the earth will
        be destroyed."<br /><br />Belokas naturally knew the meaning of the god
        Piccolo, but he was lost in thought<br /><br />"God, I won't use that
        thing, I just thought of something, I'm going first," Bellocas said<br />Ultimate
        Dragon Ball comes from Dragon Ball GT, although it is not genuine, it is
        also authorized<br />Among them, the ultimate dragon ball was made
        before the split between the god Piccolo and the big devil Piccolo, and
        its power is far above the green dragon<br /><br />Its quality far
        exceeds that of the original Namek Dragon Bolunga<br /><br />If it's
        just a veteran Dragon Ball world, Ultimate Dragon Ball doesn't exist,
        but now...<br /><br />"It is certain that this is the world that
        inherits Dragon Ball GT, or this is a parallel universe of Dragon Ball.
        In this case, Beerus, the god of destruction, may not necessarily
        appear, but the evil dragon will definitely appear."<br /><br />"The
        fourth level of the Super Saiyan, the ultimate enemy, really has a long
        way to go. This is an unstable universe. I don't know if there will be a
        story of chaos in different dimensions and Dragon Ball AF."<br /><br />"In
        this case, the existence of that 'god' may not be so important, maybe I
        will meet another me...hehe...I really look forward to the future..."<br /><br />Thinking
        of this, Belokas looked up at the boundless sky, and the Saiyan blood in
        his body seemed to speed up a lot. Although the future is full of
        dangers, there are also endless unknowns and passions.<br />　Cough, the
        combat power of a combination is as powerful as multiplication<br /><br />　　But
        fusion is not here, the setting here is the author's own setting<br />　　<br />　<br />(End

        <h2>Chapter 9</h2>
        The World's First Martial Arts Conference<br />Several months have
        passed since Belokas resolved Dr. Willow's crisis and returned to the
        Temple of Heaven. During the months of training, Belokas' combat
        effectiveness has also improved to a certain extent, reaching about
        [-]<br /><br />At this time, the World's No. 12 Martial Arts Conference
        gradually kicked off. This year, Belokas, like Monkey King, was [-]
        years old.<br />The World's No. [-] Martial Arts Conference gathers all
        the martial arts masters on earth, and its ultimate goal is to decide
        who is the world's number one<br />There are countless people
        participating in the conference, but only eight people can finally
        appear<br /><br />Sun Wukong participated in the three world's number
        one martial arts competitions completely, but only won the world's
        number one duel against Piccolo for the third time.<br /><br />The first
        time I lost to my master Guixianren, the second time I was unlucky and
        lost to Tianjin Fan, and the third time I won when I was seriously
        injured and dying<br />After that, even if Sun Wukong participated in
        the conference, he was not interested in fighting to the end<br /><br />"Remember
        that the location of the World's No. [-] Martial Arts Conference is in
        the south, and it's time to start now. Kakarot doesn't know how far you
        have grown."<br /><br />Bellocas said and then flew into the air<br /><br />With
        his current combat power, there is no one on earth comparable to him.
        The person Belokas wants to meet is Monkey King<br /><br />As for the
        others, they are all scum<br />Even the future Z fighters haven't grown
        up yet<br />At the speed of Belokas, he arrived at the venue of the
        Martial Arts Conference soon<br />I saw a sea of ​​people here,
        gathering countless people who love martial arts<br /><br />Of course
        more tourists<br />, this dojo, which was originally a temple, turned
        into a temple fair on this day, and became a paradise for warriors<br />"Yeah,
        I found it"<br /><br />After a while, Belokas saw the group of
        Guixianren who were signing up<br />In addition to Goku, there are
        Bulma, Yamcha, the bald and noseless Kling, and two transforming animals
        on Yapulu<br />There is also a lovely girl named Lan Qi<br /><br />Lan
        Qi, a girl with a bidirectional personality, can transform when she
        sneezes, the blue one is gentle and virtuous, and the golden one is more
        violent.<br />The person I like the most is Tianjin Fan. In order to
        pursue Tianjin Fan, he once followed Tianjin Fan, and even kidnapped
        others to cook for Tianjin Fan.<br /><br />But in the end, I don’t know
        why I didn’t get together with Tianjin Fan. After Dragon Ball, Lan Qi
        only appeared once, that is, when destroying Majin Buu to collect
        vitality to make vitality bombs.<br /><br />It's just that her Fenghua
        was gone at that time, and the little Wukong who used to sleep next to
        her was an upright man, and she finally became a deliveryman of a
        company.<br /><br />"These are all old people from the past. The old
        bird has given up a lot. Lan Qi is a girl with a lot of personality, but
        it's a pity that she was the first one."<br /><br />"Then there are
        Guixianren, Yamucha, Tianjin Fan, Kling... until the end there are only
        Saiyans. The laughter of the past has gradually faded away with
        maturity, and only Goku is still so heartless"<br /><br />"Be carefree,
        share the blessings, share the troubles, brothers, friends, one by one
        die, one by one lose the sense of existence, and finally only Wukong is
        left behind"<br /><br />Thinking of GT's final ending, Belokas felt like
        crying. He still remembered that no matter how many times he watched
        Dragon Ball, he couldn't help but want to cry.<br />GT looks at true
        love, the most beautiful emotion in the world, and it writes life, full
        of laughter and parting, helplessness and sadness<br />There is no
        never-ending banquet in the world, after the joy is parting<br />Even if
        the combat power is the best in the world but only one person is left in
        the end, what's the point?<br />Even if you don't want to accept it,
        isn't that life?<br /><br />Maybe it's nothing to Goku<br /><br />"But
        this kind of life, I, Belokas, will never accept it!!! I don't want to
        see that kind of ending again"<br /><br />At this moment, Belokas seems
        to have found an important thing<br />He really wanted to protect it,
        even if it meant death! !<br /><br />"Old bird, I've changed your plot"
        Belokas thought to himself<br /><br />At this time, Xiao Wukong seemed
        to feel something, and turned to look at Belokas<br /><br />I am very
        happy to meet Xiao Wukong, who is an acquaintance, and a strong and
        terrifying acquaintance<br />After practicing, maybe this time I can
        have a long and short fight with him!<br />But why does his intuition
        tell him not to do it?<br />Well... Forget it, just go all out, if
        someone can do it, then he can too<br /><br />This may be Monkey King!
        !<br /><br />And Yamcha on the side deeply remembers the feat of Belokas
        destroying the moon<br />"Wukong, we meet again, you have become a lot
        stronger this time." Belokas shook the blood-red tail behind him and
        said<br />"Last time you walked too fast, I still don't know your name,"
        said Little Wukong<br /><br />Belokas was taken aback by this and said:
        "Haha, let me introduce myself now. My name is Belokas, and like Wukong,
        I am a Saiyan of the fighting race in the universe."<br /><br />"Wukong,
        so you are really a cosmic man." The bald Klin beside him sighed
        unceasingly<br />No wonder he can't beat Wukong all the time, it turns
        out he is a cosmic man<br /><br />So how strong is this Saiyan who is
        only a little taller than him... well?It is said that even Wukong can't
        compare with him<br />"I don't know about this, but it's all the same,"
        Xiao Wukong said.<br /><br />"Wukong, why don't you introduce your new
        friend to me?" Bellocas said<br />"That's right, this is the old man Gui
        Xianren, who taught us how to practice. He is a very strong old man, and
        her name is Lan Qi. Although she is weak, she can transform. In the end,
        it's Kelin. Like me, I practiced under the guidance of Grandpa
        Guixian."<br /><br />Wukong pointed to the immortal Guixianren, Lan Qi
        and the bald Klin, and then said:<br /><br />"Belokas, are you also here
        to participate in the World's No. [-] Martial Arts Conference?"<br /><br />"Yes,
        Wukong, this time, I hope to fight with you with all my strength,"
        Bellocas said.<br />"Yeah, that would be great"<br /><br />"This kid is
        very powerful. I wonder if you can tell the old man what is the
        relationship between you and the powerful aura that appeared not long
        ago?"<br /><br />The eyes under Guixianren's sunglasses are fixed on
        Belokas<br />"Oh? That, it's just a little trick of mine that can last
        for 30 seconds." Belokas waved and received<br />30 seconds of fusion,
        not half an hour is no big deal<br />But Gui Xianren twitched his lips,
        saying it was no big deal, which made him a little speechless<br />He
        really wanted to ask, is it necessary for you to come to the Budokai
        even though you are so powerful?<br />Guixianren is hesitating whether
        he wants to become a Jackie Chan to participate in the conference<br /><br />"Okay,
        let's sign up first." Gui Xianren said with a sigh secretly, and finally
        decided to play. Of course, when he signed up, he would inevitably be
        suspected.<br /><br />This is the world's number one martial arts
        tournament, what are you three brats doing here?<br /><br />After
        signing up, there is the preliminaries, which is very simple for Belokas
        and Xiao Wukong. At the same time, the bald Klin also defeated the
        Shaolin monk who bullied him in the past<br />Belokas also couldn't
        figure it out, there is a Shaolin Temple in this place?But Kelin made a
        good show<br /><br />Due to the addition of Belokas, there is naturally
        one less player in the original book<br /><br />"Hey, little brother,
        you'd better go down, sister doesn't want to hurt you"<br /><br />The
        first game of Belokas was a contestant named Lan Fang. In the original
        book, he made the enemy lose his mind by virtue of his beauty and
        advanced to the final.<br />But it's useless for Belokas. To be precise,
        I'm still young<br /><br />"Let me take you down, don't worry, I will be
        very light."<br /><br />Belokas appeared in front of Lan Fang's eyes in
        an instant as he spoke, pointed his index finger at the center of his
        forehead and flicked lightly, and Lan Fang flew out of the ring<br />The
        people around were stunned, and Guixian shouted that he didn't know how
        to pity and cherish jade<br />Half a day later, the eight people who
        made the final move were Belokas, Jackie Chan, Goku, Klin, Yamcha,
        Nanwu, Kiran the Monster, and the barbarian who hasn't bathed for
        thousands of years.<br /><br />(End of this chapter)

        <h2>Chapter 10</h2>
        Showdown, win without a fight?<br /><br />The preliminary round of the
        World's No. [-] Martial Arts Tournament has ended, and the real decisive
        battle will be tomorrow.<br /><br />In a restaurant, under the stunned
        gazes of everyone, the supply of food after plate after plate has long
        been in short supply under the attack of Belokas and Wukong<br /><br />"It's
        been a long time since I've eaten food from the earth, the waiter will
        bring me another one according to the previous order"<br /><br />Bellocas
        licked his lips and said<br /><br />"And I"<br /><br />Little Wukong
        hurriedly said<br />Bang, everyone fell down immediately when they heard
        the words. Although Guixianren's face didn't change, his heart was
        drumming. How much is so much food?<br />The waiter looked at the pile
        of dishes like a hill and said helplessly<br />"I'm so sorry, you've
        eaten our food for two weeks"<br /><br />"That's it, then there's
        nothing I can do. I can barely eat enough."<br /><br />Belokas said, in
        the days of Tianshen Temple, it is really boring to eat celestial beans
        besides fish<br /><br />"You Saiyans are really big eaters," said the
        bald Klin<br />"Bulma, what are you looking at me for?" Bulma stared at
        himself with a puzzled look and asked Belokas<br />"What is your combat
        power? Why can't my improved detector see it?"<br /><br />Speaking of
        which, Bulma took out the red detector that Belokas had given him<br /><br />Bulma
        detected Belokas, but its data is only two points, but how is this
        possible?<br /><br />"Machines are sometimes very powerful, but people
        live and grow, which is something that machines will never be able to
        match," Belokas said while marrying his own detector<br />What do humans
        need if machines are better than humans?<br />Belokas is naturally aware
        of Bulma's question.<br /><br />Bulma's pride is her scientific prowess,
        and Belokas' situation makes him wonder if something is wrong<br /><br />Bulma
        nodded thoughtfully, and then said: "This detector does not have the
        ability to monitor, but it has the function of calling and contacting,
        but it is only a single-line connection. After modification, its upper
        limit is 100 million. Single-line contact It has also been changed to a
        two-way function, just press the red button next to it.”<br /><br />"Call?"
        Belokas was thoughtful. It seems that the Saiyans are not necessarily
        unfeeling, and they may be able to contact each other in the
        universe.<br />"Is 100 million a little less? And if the call will be
        monitored?" Belokas said<br />A million sounds very high, but in the
        later stage it can only be a fraction<br />"Nani? I don't know if 100
        million is less or less, but you can't doubt the wisdom of this genius
        girl," Bulma suddenly said to Bellokas<br /><br />"Well...nothing"
        Bellocas said<br />Bulma snorted, and Belokas didn't know what to say,
        and the atmosphere was a little deserted for a while.<br />At this time,
        the waiter said: "I said, do you want to settle the bill?"<br /><br />........................<br /><br />Time
        passed in the blink of an eye, and the finals of the World's No. [-]
        Martial Arts Tournament officially opened<br /><br />"Then start drawing
        lots now to decide your opponent and order"<br /><br />Under the
        arrangement of the host, the eight contestants decided the order of
        appearance<br />"Hi everyone, I'm sorry to keep you waiting for a long
        time. Now, the No.20 First World No. [-] Martial Arts Tournament is
        about to begin."<br /><br />"Then now I will announce the list of
        players for the first round. The first match is Mr. Barbarian vs. Mr.
        Kelin, the second match is Mr. Jackie Chan vs. Mr. Belokas, the third
        match is Sun Wukong vs. Mr. Nanwu, and the fourth match is Monster Kiran
        vs. Mr. Yamcha"<br /><br />"Shortly afterwards, the first match between
        the barbarians and the Klings will begin. In addition, the winner of
        this meeting will receive a huge bounty of 50 yuan from the meeting."<br /><br />"Then
        before the competition starts, we invite the curator of the No. [-]
        Budokan in the world to greet everyone, the curator please speak."<br /><br />Under
        the introduction of the host, the curator took over the microphone, but
        after a long while, the curator let out a thunderous "Wow..." and
        knocked everyone down.<br /><br />What followed was Kling's first duel,
        against a barbarian who had never been washed since birth.<br /><br />Under
        the barbarian's stink attack, Klin dodged left and right, but lost to
        the barbarian's stench and was directly stunned to the ground.<br /><br />In
        the end, Belokas said helplessly: "Klin, the smell you feel is just an
        illusion, you don't have a nose at all, don't you?"<br /><br />"Yes!"<br /><br />After
        the words fell, Kelin seemed to see the light of day, and when the
        referee counted to nine, he fought<br /><br />"Thank you...Belokas"<br /><br />Then
        Krillin took his stance, keeping his eyes on the savage<br /><br />"Okay...
        I'm going to fight back"<br /><br />"I'm going to kill you, brat," the
        barbarian said angrily<br />"This... barbarian is going to spit! It is
        said that even elephants are scared to run around when they see him
        spitting. Is there any way for Contestant Kelin to escape?"<br /><br />Under
        the host's explanation, the moment the barbarian spit, time seemed to
        stand still. Klin jumped up from the spot, and kicked the barbarian's
        thick face heavily.<br /><br />The barbarian fell to the ground in an
        instant, Kling took advantage of the victory and ran to the barbarian,
        took off his pants, and hit the barbarian with a big stinky fart,
        stunned the barbarian.<br /><br />"A miraculous big counterattack,
        Klin's victory is really beautiful"<br /><br />Under the cheers of the
        audience, Xiao Wukong and Klin cheered together.<br /><br />After a kind
        of staff cleaned the ring, the second game belonging to Belokas
        officially started<br /><br />"The second match is between Jackie Chan
        and Belokas, who is only 12 years old. Please come on stage."<br /><br />While
        the host was speaking, Belokas and Jackie Chan slowly walked onto the
        ring, and the voice of Xiao Wukong came from behind<br /><br />"Belokas,
        come on"<br /><br />"Don't worry, Wukong, I won't lose," Belokas
        replied, and then looked at Guixian who was pretending to be a
        dragon.<br /><br />"Why?" Turtle Immortal asked<br />"what why?"<br /><br />"Your
        strength has reached an unprecedented level. Why do you still want to
        participate in the Martial Arts Conference? No one here can beat you.
        What is your purpose?" Guixian asked in a deep voice.<br />"Purpose? Of
        course it's Kakarot," Bellocas said.<br />"Kakarot? Are you talking
        about Wukong? Wukong is an Earthling now, so he won't destroy other
        people's planets." Guixian said<br /><br />Little Wukong can be said to
        be the most proud disciple in his life. If something bad happens, even
        if he dies, he will try his best to stop it.<br /><br />"Kame Immortal,
        the job of Saiyans is indeed to buy and sell planets, but that's just
        work. Do what you want, and kill them if you don't like it. This is the
        nature of Saiyans. They pursue powerful enemies and fight game after
        game. Competing is the instinct of a Saiyan."<br /><br />"The principle
        of my life is that I will not be attacked if I am not attacked. I have
        devoted my life to pursuing a strong opponent and yearning for supreme
        combat power. Wukong is such a person. Do you understand me when I say
        that?"<br /><br />Guixian was silent for a while and said: "I know, it
        is rare to have a confidant in this world, but I will not automatically
        give up and admit defeat."<br /><br />"Because before I saw your
        strength with my own eyes, I was still a real Martial Daoist"<br /><br />After
        all, Gui Xianren set up a posture in Gui Xianren's dignified eyes<br /><br />"I
        get it, you won't be disappointed"<br /><br />Belokas's voice fell, and
        his figure in place suddenly became transparent<br /><br />Then just
        hear whoosh, bang!With a sound, the Guixianren fell off the field like a
        rootless duckweed<br /><br />"Ah!! Off the court, what's going on,
        Jackie Chan lost for no reason, what is hidden in it?"<br /><br />At
        this moment, the host's voice sounded, Guixian looked at Belokas with a
        face full of horror, was taken aback for a moment, and then smiled as if
        relaxed<br />"It's true that the waves behind the Yangtze River push the
        waves ahead. It seems that the era of Teacher Wu Tian has passed, and I
        can relax a little bit from now on."<br /><br />Belokas watched the
        bleak and old figure slowly leave the scene, feeling an indescribable
        feeling in his heart<br /><br />But Belokas has no regrets, because this
        is the dignity of a martial artist<br />(End of this chapter)
