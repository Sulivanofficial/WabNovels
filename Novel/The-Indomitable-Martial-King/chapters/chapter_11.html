          <p>[ Chapter 101 ]</p>
          <p>
            In the deep of night, the geothermal stones that heated the Grand
            Forge dimmed their light all at once, and darkness enveloped
            everything. Apart from a few guards, the entire Grand Forge was deep
            in slumber. Repenhardt and the others had also retired early to
            rest, preparing to depart early the next morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris walked alone through these dark streets, compelled by a
            meeting with someone.
          </p>
          <p>
            With elf-like silence, she headed toward the center of the Grand
            Forge. She reached a towering iron tower and, climbing the stairs,
            Siris’s expression was grimly set.
          </p>
          <p>
            As she opened the door, an old dwarf, his appearance nearly obscured
            by a snow-white beard, greeted her. It was Makelin, the High Priest
            of Al Fort.
          </p>
          <p>“Welcome, young elf.”</p>
          <p>Entering, Siris responded in a chilly voice.</p>
          <p>
            “I received your message. You hold the answers to my questions.”
          </p>
          <p>Makelin stroked his beard and chuckled heartily.</p>
          <p>“Come, take a seat over here.”</p>
          <p>
            After ushering Siris into the sitting room, Makelin quietly asked,
          </p>
          <p>“What is your question, young elf?”</p>
          <p>
            As if she had been waiting for this moment, Siris calmly replied.
          </p>
          <p>“Everything, about Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            From their first meeting, Repenhardt’s demeanor had been
            incomprehensible to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “From the beginning… it seemed as though he knew me well. His gaze,
            his actions, his tone of voice, they were not those of someone
            meeting a stranger.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, his subsequent actions were filled with equally
            incomprehensible behaviors. Given his age and the life he had lived,
            there was no way to explain his remarkable skills and profound
            knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even more, he knew my real name, something I didn’t even know
            myself. How is that possible?”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Siris’s tone grew more insistent, Makelin inwardly sighed.
            Telling her the truth was simple. However, Repenhardt’s silence was
            not due to ignorance but a fear of the repercussions.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, Makelin spoke softly.</p>
          <p>“Young elf, Siris.”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>“I know his secret.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris’s eyes sparkled as she sensed his forthcoming words. Feeling
            her probing gaze, Makelin continued,
          </p>
          <p>“And he is afraid that you might not understand.”</p>
          <p>“Why?”</p>
          <p>
            Confused, Siris murmured softly. She could not fathom what kind of
            secret would make her incapable of understanding. Makelin smiled
            gently, then spoke reassuringly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “As one who has lived a bit longer, and as someone who belongs to
            the same yet different species, I shall offer you my advice.”
          </p>

          <p>Siris nodded blankly. Makelin stroked his beard.</p>
          <p>
            “Do you think you can trust him? Can you trust him and not
            misunderstand him in any situation?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris tilted her head. The whole secrecy seemed somewhat amusing.
            Repenhardt was a being of immense power, capable of reviving the
            World Tree Elvenheim, a wish of all elves. The miraculous scene from
            that time was still vivid in her memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Honestly, I could believe he is one of the gods incarnate on
            earth.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Makelin seriously shook his head at her slightly playful response.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s not what I mean.”</p>
          <p>
            Makelin paused to organize his thoughts. A conversation he had with
            Repenhardt late at night came to mind.
          </p>
          <p>-I don’t have the confidence to tell Siris everything.</p>
          <p>
            Makelin could fully understand Repenhardt’s feelings. Even Makelin,
            a dwarf who hears the voice of truth, hadn’t asked for evidence, so
            absurd it was. However, Makelin did not agree with him.
          </p>
          <p>
            -I don’t think she wouldn’t believe it either. The truth of time
            regression can explain all the actions you’ve shown so far. Elves
            are a rational race. I believe she will trust you…
          </p>
          <p>-Honestly, even if she trusts me, that’s a problem…</p>
          <p>Repenhardt sighed as he continued.</p>
          <p>
            -She said it. That I was looking past her. She wasn’t wrong. You
            understand why she felt that way, don’t you?
          </p>
          <p>
            Only then did Makelin realize what Repenhardt was truly worried
            about. Repenhardt murmured in a weak voice.
          </p>
          <p>-I don’t want to be hated by her.</p>
          <p>
            Eventually, Repenhardt left after asking Makelin to explain
            everything to Siris on his behalf. It could be seen as quite
            irresponsible for a man to pass this burden to someone else. But
            sometimes, it’s better for a third party to reveal the truth.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ll ask again. Can you trust him?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris’s expression became serious. With a resolved look, she nodded.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>Makelin slowly opened his mouth.</p>
          <p>“Then, I will tell you everything.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Exiting the central tower, Siris walked with a defeated look on her
            face, still haunted by the echo of Makelin’s voice in her mind.
          </p>
          <p>“He is one who has traversed through time.”</p>
          <p>A legendary 10th circle archmage, unprecedented in history.</p>
          <p>
            He stood up for other races, even bearing the stigma of being called
            a demon lord, in his quest to change the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite a previous failure, he was determined to realize his dream
            once more, turning back time itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything made sense now. Siris understood why Repenhardt had been
            so reluctant to reveal the truth.
          </p>

          <p>
            Frankly, she thought that had it not been for the miraculous revival
            of the World Tree, she would have considered him a madman.
            Therefore, she held no resentment towards Repenhardt for deceiving
            her—it was completely understandable.
          </p>
          <p>It was somewhat comforting.</p>
          <p>
            His dream, his goals, were not mere fantasies. All his attitudes had
            been genuine, not pretense—a fact that brought her joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the truth did not make Siris feel entirely at peace.
            Another layer of truth, concerning herself, troubled her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “According to him, you and I both were very close to him. Especially
            you; you were one of his Four Heavenly Kings and his lover.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Mulling over Makelin’s words, Siris muttered to herself, “Siris
            Valencia…”
          </p>
          <p>The name belonged to Repenhardt’s lover from his memories.</p>
          <p>
            The leader and spokesperson of all elves on the continent, and their
            guardian.
          </p>
          <p>
            She was a master of the seven elemental magics, among the
            continent’s renowned swordsmen and a high mage who had reached the
            8th circle. To other races, she was known as the embodiment of
            kindness and mercy, even hailed as the incarnation of Eldia. To
            humans, she was a goddess of madness and terror.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that really me?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris couldn’t identify herself with that elven woman. She couldn’t
            believe she might become such a formidable entity in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            It made sense that Repenhardt knew so much about her. From their
            very first meeting, his gaze had been filled with deep affection—it
            was clear now. To him, Siris was a precious lover whom he had
            encountered again across time.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, for Siris, it was merely a nonexistent time.</p>
          <p>She was profoundly confused.</p>
          <p>“If only he was projecting his old first love onto me…”</p>
          <p>
            That would have made it easier to steady her wavering heart. Whether
            to reject or accept his feelings, Siris felt she could have decided
            completely on her own.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, she found herself at a loss on how to perceive this
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was clearly projecting his former lover onto Siris. Yet,
            that projected lover was Siris herself, from the future. Then, who
            exactly was the recipient of Repenhardt’s affection?
          </p>
          <p>“Sigh…”</p>
          <p>A sigh escaped her lips.</p>
          <p>
            As she walked through the chaos in her mind, Siris found herself
            unexpectedly arriving at her lodging. She entered quietly, careful
            not to awaken her sleeping companions. They had a long journey ahead
            starting tomorrow, and lack of rest would only be a burden to the
            group.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stepping inside, she sensed a presence and turned with a start. In
            the large living room, which connected to each of their rooms, sat a
            formidable figure at the table. It was Repenhardt, whom she had
            assumed would be asleep.
          </p>
          <p>His voice was calm.</p>
          <p>“You heard everything, didn’t you?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris approached Repenhardt gently. He maintained a composed facade,
            but Siris, now attuned to elemental magic, could distinctly sense
            the anxiety hiding beneath his calm voice.
          </p>
          <p>“…It was indeed a story beyond imagination.”</p>
          <p>She spoke in a soft voice.</p>

          <p>
            “But I can accept it. Considering everything you’ve shown me until
            now.”
          </p>
          <p>“Is that so…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s face relaxed slightly, then tensed up again.</p>
          <p>“Then… can you forgive my ‘attitude’?”</p>
          <p>Siris fell silent.</p>
          <p>The darkness was filled with silence.</p>
          <p>After a long while, she finally spoke again.</p>
          <p>“I will follow you, Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            It was an ambiguous response. Repenhardt looked puzzled. Siris
            continued in a colder voice.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s all I can offer you right now.”</p>
          <p>
            It was unavoidable. No matter how much she pondered, there was only
            one conclusion she could reach.
          </p>
          <p>“…Because I am not the ‘Siris’ from your memories.”</p>
          <p>
            It was a soft yet firm reply. In an instant, Repenhardt’s shoulders
            slumped. Pretending not to notice, Siris walked quietly to her room.
            She brushed past the curtain, casually bidding him goodnight.
          </p>
          <p>“Then, have a good night.”</p>
          <p>“Uh, uh…”</p>
          <p>
            While responding, Repenhardt remained dejectedly seated, his form
            reminiscent of a forlorn large dog abandoned by its owner.
          </p>
          <p>Just as she was entering her room, Siris muttered,</p>
          <p>“Still…”</p>
          <p>“Hmm?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt lifted his head, his eyes catching the sight of her face,
            slightly smiling at him.
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t dislike you,” she declared.</p>
          <p>
            After her final words, Siris immediately entered her room. Left
            alone in the living room, Repenhardt simply stared at the curtain
            covering her door.
          </p>
          <p>
            A while later, Repenhardt muttered with a dumbfounded expression,
            “So, does that mean you forgive me, or not?”
          </p>
          <p>The world was at peace.</p>
          <p>
            There was no Demon King aiming to annihilate humanity, no grand war
            where dozens of nations clashed with swords and spears, and no
            legendary dragons threatening to wipe out all humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this was a macroscopic view of the entire continent. While
            some regions celebrated an era of peace, others cried out in
            torment, describing life as a living hell. Such is the nature of
            human existence.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Kingdom of Crovence, however, peace was far from reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the central region of Crovence, in an unnamed vast field, a group
            of knights were engaged in fierce battle.
          </p>
          <p>“In the name of Carsus! Wipe out that filthy band of usurpers!”</p>
          <p>
            “Tear open their filthy mouths! Kill the traitors in the name of the
            legitimate royal line!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaders of each group shouted as they charged into enemy lines,
            followed by many knights and soldiers swinging their spears. A rain
            of arrows filled the air, and screams and roars echoed across the
            battlefield. The knights following Sir Carsus, the heir of the
            Fernando ducal family, clashed with the forces loyal to Prince Yubel
            Ren Crovence, the kingdom’s second prince. Each side believed in the
            legitimacy of their leader, continuously engaged in a dreadful
            battle that relentlessly took lives from both sides.
          </p>
          <p>“For the true king, Lord Carsus!”</p>
          <p>“Prince Yubel is the rightful king of this country!”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 102 ]</p>
          <p>
            Half a year had passed since the sudden death of the former king,
            Gotrin I. The Kingdom of Crovence found itself plunged into a severe
            civil war, with Prince Carsus of the Fernando ducal family and
            Prince Yubel vying for the vacant throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, such a dire situation should not have arisen. Gotrin I
            had an heir, Telion, born to the king and his queen, who possessed
            an unquestionable legitimate bloodline, making him the undisputed
            successor to the throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the situation turned dire when, not long after King
            Gotrin’s death, the heir Telion also died within a fortnight,
            succumbing to an unidentified illness.
          </p>
          <p>The death of an heir was a significant problem.</p>
          <p>
            An even greater problem was that Telion had left no descendants.
          </p>
          <p>
            Telion, wise as he was, understood the political implications of his
            marriage. Thus, he had refrained from choosing a queen until his
            late twenties, using his position to navigate among the noble
            factions within the country.
          </p>
          <p>
            This could be considered excellent political acumen for a successor.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, his untimely death meant that there was no clear heir to
            follow, posing a major issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            With both the king and the heir gone within a fortnight, the royal
            advisors of the Kingdom of Crovence, amidst their grief, conducted
            the funerals and soon began discussions on who would ascend as the
            next monarch.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first candidate to arise was Yubel Ren Crovence, who turned
            eighteen this year. However, this prince had a significant flaw in
            his legitimacy.
          </p>
          <p>He was the child of a concubine.</p>
          <p>
            In royal contexts, having concubines or consorts isn’t usually
            problematic. Even if born to a concubine, bearing the king’s blood
            would naturally grant one the title of prince.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although there were a few other concubines, unfortunately, it seemed
            Gotrin I wasn’t particularly prolific, with only Telion and Yubel as
            his surviving offspring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the lack of alternatives, it seemed that Yubel’s succession to
            the throne might proceed without much issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Yubel faced severe opposition due to his lineage,
            particularly because his mother was not of royal or noble birth but
            a humble commoner from a foreign land.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the lack of choices, most nobles found it unacceptable to
            crown someone of such base bloodline as king.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, another candidate emerged: Carsus from the Fernando ducal
            family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carsus, now 28 years old, was not a son of King Gotrin, but he
            possessed a significantly royal bloodline.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was the son of Duke Fernando, the former king’s brother, and his
            maternal lineage was also of royal descent from the Brozen ducal
            family.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many believed that, in terms of lineage, he was more fitting to be a
            king than Yubel, who had foreign commoner blood mixed in.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, Carsus was a knight renowned for his valor and already
            had a notable reputation. He was deeply trusted by his subordinates,
            respected for his nobility and bravery, and was overall revered.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, Yubel was famous for a different reason, namely,
            as a libertine.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it was not that Yubel was involved in disgusting acts of
            chasing after every woman. In fact, he was only seen with one woman.
            The issue was that this woman was not human but a dwarf.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, being involved with an elf woman was also not something
            proudly flaunted. While many in power might engage in such
            relationships discreetly, it was not something to openly parade,
            especially not with a dwarf.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being an adult by dwarf standards, a dwarf woman’s
            appearance resembles that of a young human girl. Yubel’s constant
            association and flirtatious behavior with such a woman did not look
            good, to say the least.
          </p>
          <p>It was scandalous enough to be the talk of the town.</p>
          <p>This situation made things rather ambiguous.</p>
          <p>
            On one side was a man who, though not the son of the former king,
            was a respected knight and highly suitable for the throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other side was a man who, aside from being the king’s son,
            had no noteworthy qualities and was merely a notorious libertine.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was inevitable that the nobility would be divided in their
            opinions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ducal families of Fernando and Brozen pushed for Carsus to be
            king, supported by lords from various regions and traditional noble
            families.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those supporting Yubel were mostly conservative nobles who valued
            legitimacy and the newly risen nobility, primarily merchants who had
            accumulated wealth and earned titles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Yubel’s mother was a commoner, she was not from a poor
            background. The romantic notion of a poor maiden becoming a
            concubine to a king was nothing more than a fanciful tale.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reality, she was the daughter of the largest merchant family in
            the Crovence Kingdom, the Feonin family, with whom most of the
            merchant families allied with Yubel had ties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite numerous debates and discussions regarding legitimacy, no
            conclusion was reached. Both sides had their flaws, making it
            impossible to resolve through mere words.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, not even two months after the king’s death, a civil war
            broke out.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            In the central region of the Kingdom of Crovence, within the barony
            of Delphia.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the second-floor balcony of a pristine mansion built of bricks
            and coated with lime, a man sat gazing out of the window. He was a
            handsome young man with clear skin, distinct facial features, golden
            blond hair shining like gold, and jewel-like green eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The young man looked gloomily at the forest below. The long winter
            had ended, and the forest was becoming lush with the verdant sprouts
            of spring.
          </p>

          <p>Suddenly, the young man muttered,</p>
          <p>“How much longer can I endure?”</p>
          <p>
            Yubel, the second prince of the Kingdom of Crovence, appeared
            drained as he was absorbed in thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            The civil war with the Carsus army initially seemed to favor Yubel.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wealthy merchants did not hesitate to spend their fortunes for
            Yubel’s victory. They wished for Yubel to ascend the throne, hoping
            that the Kingdom of Crovence would become a nation supportive of
            commerce like the Duchy of Chatan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being the continent’s largest granary, Crovence’s rigid
            policies largely ignored merchants, letting most of its wealth be
            snatched away by Chatan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Utilizing his original forces and hiring mercenaries from across the
            continent, Yubel’s side pressed the Carsus army. Numbers usually
            triumph over even the bravest knights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outnumbered by more than three to one, even the renowned knight of
            knights, Carsus, found himself overwhelmed. Victory had seemed
            imminent at that point.
          </p>
          <p>But the situation reversed thereafter.</p>
          <p>“Sigh…”</p>
          <p>
            Yubel turned his gaze away from the forest, and his eyes landed on a
            vast barley field beyond. Normally, it would be swaying with golden
            hues, ripe with bountiful grains, but now only the parched, dying
            leaves of barley were visible.
          </p>
          <p>Yubel lamented in a tone of despair,</p>
          <p>“Why must such a severe famine strike now?”</p>
          <p>A tremendous drought had struck the entire Kingdom of Crovence.</p>
          <p>
            Once blessed by Redanti to never dry up, this land of abundance was
            now suffering an extreme famine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The already prolonged civil war had worsened law and order, with
            deserters and mercenaries across the kingdom committing murder,
            rape, and pillage.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the famine on top, Crovence had truly become a hellish reality.
            Stories of parents consuming their own children were merely one of
            the many horrific rumors circulating around.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this was an event akin to a bolt from the blue for Yubel’s side.
            Most of the merchants dealt with grain.
          </p>
          <p>
            One by one, their trading companies went bankrupt, and in their
            place, as if knowing exactly when to appear, the Chatan Duchy’s
            Taoban Trading Company emerged with their grains.
          </p>
          <p>
            When funds ran out, the mercenaries quickly betrayed them, and the
            tide of the battle reversed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to this, Yubel now found himself taking refuge as far as the
            Baronial lands of Delphia in the eastern wilderness of the Crovence
            Kingdom.
          </p>

          <p>Of course, even this place was not safe.</p>
          <p>
            Due to the famine, even the Carsus side found it hard to continue
            the war, temporarily leading to a ceasefire. Nevertheless,
            diplomatic pressure continued, demanding the head of a usurper who
            coveted the throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Baron of Delphia, still respecting the merchant’s honor, had so
            far ignored this, but if the famine continued, it was uncertain how
            things would turn out. Every day was like sitting on pins and
            needles.
          </p>
          <p>After stretching, Yubel pursed his lips and grumbled.</p>
          <p>
            “Who asked to be made a king? They’re forcing me into this, and look
            what a mess it’s become.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Neither he nor his mother had any interest in the throne. It was his
            maternal grandfather, the head of the Feonin Trading Company, who
            had been greedy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind a grumbling Yubel, a girl walked up softly. She was a dainty
            girl with neatly braided black hair and a cute face. Her pointed
            ears and unnaturally full chest proved she was not human. She was
            Finia, the dwarf woman who had caused Yubel’s bad reputation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Finia approached Yubel, she gently stroked his hair. Being quite
            tall, Yubel sat down, and Finia stood behind him, reaching a
            suitable height. She tenderly ran her fingers through his hair and
            asked softly.
          </p>
          <p>“Yubel, do you really hate being king that much?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yeah, I really hate it. But it seems like the mood is either I
            become king or I become a head on the block.”
          </p>
          <p>“That seems likely.”</p>
          <p>
            As she caressed Yubel’s cheek, Finia replied nonchalantly. Yubel
            leaned his head back to look at Finia’s face and grumbled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hey, don’t talk about it like it’s someone else’s problem, Finia.
            If I lose my head, you’re next.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Surely, they wouldn’t spare a wicked dwarf witch who had enchanted
            royalty. Finia smirked and then turned around to sit lightly on
            Yubel’s lap. She wrapped her arms around his neck and murmured in a
            playful voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Just how did I end up falling in love with a man like this?”</p>
          <p>“Sorry for being such a man.”</p>
          <p>
            With a sullen expression, Yubel turned his head away. Finia laughed
            heartily, grabbed his face, and kissed him on the lips. As Yubel’s
            expression softened, Finia spoke soothingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s okay. We’re safe for the time being. Even wars must fill their
            bellies, right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to a severe famine, the Kingdom of Crovence was in chaos.
            Although the merchants were hit hard, the Carsus territory was also
            busy managing their own lands.
          </p>
          <p>
            “They won’t be able to move until they secure their food supplies.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “And the moment they do move, I’m done for. My life has an expiry
            date now.”
          </p>
          <p>Finia playfully tapped Yubel’s cheek as he grumbled.</p>
          <p>
            “If it comes to that, we’ll just have to run away smartly, Yubel.”
          </p>
          <p>“Just the two of us, running away in love?”</p>
          <p>
            “It’s too late for a love escape; this is simply exile. If we hide
            our identities and flee to another country, surely they won’t chase
            after us, right?”
          </p>
          <p>“Finia, I was raised too gently to handle harsh situations.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 102 (part 2) ]</p>
          <p>“I grew up tough, so I can take care of us. I can support you.”</p>
          <p>“No, it’s somewhat shameful for a man to rely on a woman…”</p>
          <p>
            “Why? What’s so strange about a master making a slave work to earn
            money?”
          </p>
          <p>“Who’s calling whom a slave?”</p>
          <p>
            Yubel frowned at this, and Finia’s eyes moistened with tears. She
            nestled into Yubel’s arms, resting her head against his chest, and
            whispered.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s inevitable. In this world, I’m nothing but a slave, whether
            you are a king or not…”
          </p>
          <p>“Finia…”</p>
          <p>Yubel held her close and sighed deeply.</p>
          <p>
            He knew that even if he won this war and became king, he would not
            be able to have what he truly wanted.
          </p>
          <p>“There will be no place that sees us as lovers…”</p>
          <p>
            The two lovers looked into each other’s sad eyes, whispering softly,
            their breaths mingling.
          </p>
          <p>“I love you, Yubel.”</p>
          <p>“I love you, Finia.”</p>
          <p>Suddenly, an unfamiliar voice echoed from the inner room.</p>
          <p>“…Having a nice chat~.”</p>
          <p>In an instant, sparks flew in Finia’s eyes.</p>
          <p>“Who is it!”</p>
          <p>
            With a shout, she sprang up from Yubel’s embrace and kicked the
            floor. A large axe spear, lying on the ground, spun up into the air.
            With practiced motion, Finia grabbed the axe spear and aimed it
            towards the living room.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her eyes gleamed ominously. The woman who was whispering of love was
            gone, replaced by a warrior brimming with fighting spirit.
          </p>
          <p>“Reveal your identity!”</p>
          <p>
            From a dark corner of the living room, a man slowly emerged, draped
            in a red robe, looking like a magician. His face was hidden deeply
            under a hood as he approached Yubel.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you Prince Yubel of Crovence?”</p>
          <p>
            Finia, tense like a threatened cat, eyed the man warily. Yubel
            narrowed his eyes, positioning himself behind her protectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know how you found this place, but first, state your
            identity and business.”
          </p>
          <p>The man in the red robe replied with a laugh.</p>
          <p>
            “My name is Repenhardt. I am a magician. I’ve come to offer my
            modest powers to the rightful king of Crovence.”
          </p>
          <p>“You came to join my cause?”</p>
          <p>
            Yubel looked at Finia skeptically. She shook her head slightly, her
            expression saying she didn’t understand.
          </p>

          <p>“For now… it seems he is not lying, Lord Yubel.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Yubel breathed a sigh of relief after hearing Finia’s words. At
            least it meant that the man in the red robe was not an assassin.
          </p>
          <p>Relaxing, Yubel scrutinized the man before him, Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>‘At first glance, he looks like a wizard, but…’</p>
          <p>
            Something felt odd. As if the sense of perspective was slightly
            skewed? And as Repenhardt slowly approached him, Yubel finally
            realized why.
          </p>
          <p>‘What? How is he so huge?’</p>
          <p>
            Yubel prided himself on being of average height for a young man of
            his era.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this wizard named Repenhardt was a full head taller than
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it was just a matter of being lanky, he could understand, but
            even the breadth of his shoulders would make any knight weep in
            envy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even Sir Tawein, the largest of his knights, seemed small compared
            to this wizard.
          </p>
          <p>
            From afar, Yubel hadn’t noticed, but up close, it felt as if the red
            robe filled his entire field of vision.
          </p>
          <p>“You are, quite imposing, sir.”</p>
          <p>Yubel muttered, intimidated. Repenhardt gave a wry smile.</p>
          <p>“Do I not look like a wizard?”</p>
          <p>
            ‘I even chose a generously sized robe to cover my muscles, but
            alas.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt inwardly clicked his tongue. No matter what, his large
            volume could hardly be concealed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Yubel wasn’t too bothered. After all, it wasn’t unheard of for
            wizards to be well-built.
          </p>
          <p>“A battle mage, I presume?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, well…”</p>
          <p>
            A battle mage defined as a warlock skilled in both physical combat
            and magic. It wasn’t incorrect, so Repenhardt simply nodded. Yubel
            straightened up and looked at Repenhardt with a newfound solemnity.
            A serious voice flowed from the lips of this notoriously wayward
            prince.
          </p>
          <p>“Have you truly come to aid me?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly.”</p>
          <p>
            “That sounds like something one would say after eavesdropping on a
            private conversation…”
          </p>
          <p>“Must be your imagination.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt began to sweat profusely. Just moments ago, he had
            inadvertently commented as he witnessed Yubel and Finia in an
            affectionate display. It was hard not to be irritated by someone
            flaunting their relationship right in front of him, who hadn’t made
            any progress in his own romantic endeavors. His muttered remark had
            been overheard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yubel looked suspicious and glanced at Finia. She rolled her eyes
            and retorted.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s a lie.”</p>
          <p>“Really?”</p>

          <p>
            As if he expected it, Yubel Ren Crovence also rolled his eyes.
            Repenhardt inwardly sighed in frustration.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, this is why dwarves are such a headache.’</p>
          <p>
            The racial trait of dwarves, having ears that hear the truth, indeed
            made them challenging to deal with in various ways. Of course, there
            are various ways to speak only the truth while hiding parts of it,
            thus crafting lies, so it’s not impossible to deceive them. However,
            that would require the skills of a professional con artist, and
            Repenhardt lacked such eloquence.
          </p>
          <p>Yubel shook his head, seeing Repenhardt’s discomfort.</p>
          <p>“Of course, it’s natural for you to look at it that way.”</p>
          <p>Surprisingly, Yubel didn’t seem angry at all.</p>
          <p>“Don’t worry. I’m not bothered.”</p>
          <p>
            After all, Yubel had experienced all kinds of scrutiny due to his
            relationship with Finia. He wasn’t unaware of the rumors circulating
            behind closed doors. Actually, a comment like ‘He’s quite good.’ was
            quite friendly from Yubel’s perspective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, feeling awkward, lifted his hood. His face was
            unexpectedly young, causing Yubel and Finia to wear slightly
            surprised expressions. Repenhardt scratched his head.
          </p>
          <p>“I didn’t mean to criticize. After all, my lover is an elf.”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            The word ‘lover’ was not to be used carelessly. Finia whispered to
            Yubel, visibly more shocked.
          </p>
          <p>“It, it seems real?”</p>
          <p>
            Her tone dropped its pretense and reverted to casual as she was
            genuinely surprised. The two started to scrutinize Repenhardt as if
            looking at an exotic animal. Repenhardt, feeling embarrassed, asked.
          </p>
          <p>“Why are you looking at me like that?”</p>
          <p>
            “Just… I didn’t know there was another pervert like me in the
            world…”
          </p>
          <p>“…”</p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the world was full of men who sexually desired women of
            other races, but few truly loved them. Yubel’s amazement was
            understandable.
          </p>
          <p>This oddly eased the atmosphere. Repenhardt sighed internally.</p>
          <p>‘Gosh… How did the mood turn out like this?’</p>
          <p>
            His original plan was to appear mysteriously and play the role of a
            wise man assisting the prince, but instead, the conversation had
            turned into something akin to club activities for people with
            unusual tastes.
          </p>
          <p>‘Mystery is truly not for everyone…’</p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, this had significantly lowered Yubel and Finia’s
            guard. Yubel looked at Repenhardt with a princely expression again
            and suddenly spoke.
          </p>
          <p>“You said you came to help me?”</p>
          <p>“That’s right, Your Highness Yubel.”</p>
          <p>“So, what kind of help can you offer?”</p>
          <p>Yubel asked with dignity.</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt straightened his posture and replied in a serious voice,
            “What about military provisions worth a hundred thousand gold
            coins?”
          </p>
          <p>Instantly, the expressions of Yubel and Finia hardened.</p>

          <p>“A hundred thousand gold coins?”</p>
          <p>
            That amount would be equivalent to half a year’s budget for the
            Crovence royal family—an enormous sum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such a quantity of grain could feed the entire Kingdom of Crovence
            for three months with some to spare.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, these were prices before the onset of the famine; the
            cost of grain had increased twenty to thirty times by now, making it
            no longer such an immense sum.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it was certainly enough to cover all of Yubel’s troops’
            provisions.
          </p>
          <p>“…Rich, aren’t you? Do wizards earn that well?”</p>
          <p>
            Yubel tried to mix jest to hide his dismay, but his voice was
            trembling. If Repenhardt’s support were to arrive for Yubel’s
            beleaguered forces, it would be enough to shift the balance of
            power!
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s almost suspicious how timely this is… could it be a nasty
            lie?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Yubel slumped into his chair, drained, muttering weakly. The
            proposal was indeed genuine, as Finia had confirmed its authenticity
            from beside him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, Repenhardt delivered the final blow as if to clinch the deal.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And depending on the situation, we may also aid with troops. Few in
            number, but high in quality.”
          </p>
          <p>“…May I ask what you mean by high quality?”</p>
          <p>
            At this point, Yubel could no longer maintain his informal speech.
            His tone shifted slightly towards formality. Repenhardt smiled
            triumphantly and retorted.
          </p>
          <p>“How many aura wielders are there under Your Highness Yubel?”</p>
          <p>“…Not even one…”</p>
          <p>
            Yubel grimaced and answered softly. In the entire Kingdom of
            Crovence, there were only five aura users. Two supported Prince
            Carsus, while the remaining three remained neutral, observing the
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was why Yubel’s forces, despite overwhelming financial power
            initially, had not secured victory. An aura user was in itself a
            tactical weapon, and Yubel’s side had none.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt spoke calmly to the embarrassed Yubel.</p>
          <p>
            “Then, six aura users would be a significant force, wouldn’t they?”
          </p>
          <p>“Six?”</p>
          <p>
            Yubel stood up abruptly in shock. In the entire Kingdom of Crovence,
            there were only five aura users. Was this wizard claiming to have
            the power to summon more aura users than his own country possessed?
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt nodded calmly. Yubel began to suspect he was dreaming.
            Simultaneously, a sense of alarm arose within him. What exactly did
            this man want in return for offering such an incredible deal?
          </p>
          <p>“What would be the price for such assistance?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt bowed politely.</p>
          <p>
            “Should Your Majesty become king, I would request that you grant me
            a fiefdom.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Yubel looked puzzled. The request seemed too common given the
            conditions.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that all?”</p>
          <p>
            That alone did not justify why Repenhardt had sought out Yubel.
            Currently, Yubel was nearly cornered in his struggle for power. It
            made little sense to bet on someone likely to lose. Moreover, with
            the terms Repenhardt was proposing, he could have easily approached
            Carsus and received a warm welcome, especially since they were more
            desperate for military provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I understand your doubts. But once you hear my reasons, you will
            understand why I have sought you out,” Repenhardt continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The fiefdom I desire must be an autonomous region, independent from
            the laws of the Kingdom of Crovence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Yubel’s expression showed a hint of understanding. Repenhardt was
            seeking a dukedom or a march, a territory within the nation that had
            its own legal and administrative system. Indeed, such a grant would
            be difficult to bestow without considerable merit, as it would
            recognize an authority independent from the royal throne.
          </p>
          <p>
            “…That would indeed be a condition that Prince Carsus of Carsus
            would not accept. But why?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smiled knowingly and answered. And with that response,
            Yubel understood all too clearly why Repenhardt had chosen him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What I desire is a place where elves, dwarves, and orcs can live
            freely, Your Majesty Yubel.”

          <p>[ Chapter 103 ]</p>
          <p>A small village situated within the domain of Baron Delphia.</p>
          <p>
            The atmosphere of the village was eerily unsettling. There was
            already a severe famine causing widespread starvation, and with
            Prince Yubel and his army’s arrival, the likelihood of this place
            turning into a battlefield had drastically increased. Most villagers
            were trembling in fear, dreading what the future might hold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Amidst a long drought, the parched village lay silent, its streets
            deserted. Two figures walked through this stillness—Repenhardt, who
            had just met with Prince Yubel and escaped the castle, and Siris,
            who had been waiting outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they headed towards the inn where their companions were staying,
            Siris casually asked, “Did the discussion go well?”
          </p>
          <p>“It went well enough in itself.”</p>
          <p>
            For Prince Yubel, there was no reason to oppose Repenhardt’s views.
            In his current situation, he was as good as a head on the
            block—hardly in a position to choose between freshly baked or stale
            bread. Moreover, Repenhardt’s suggestion was something Yubel had
            always desired, making opposition even less likely. The discussion
            itself was smooth, without any obstacles.
          </p>
          <p>“The issue is whether things will proceed as discussed.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt pursed his lips in dissatisfaction. It was one thing for
            Yubel to agree, but whether his subordinates, the nobles, would
            accept his opinion was another matter. Even Yubel, though he agreed
            with the idea, showed reluctance about its implementation.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Given the current circumstances, there should be few who oppose
            your demands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had claimed a territory that belonged to the son of
            Viscount Carsus, under the lordship of Count Gelfein. This land,
            located in the rugged Gloten Mountains in the western part of the
            Crovence Kingdom, was always plagued by monsters and wild beasts.
            Its main industry was mining, using dwarf slaves, and it was a place
            where few humans lived. Moreover, the mining industry was barely
            profitable anymore due to the depletion of ore veins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The land was an enemy territory and had little value, something the
            nobles had no interest in. Count Gelfein’s support for Viscount
            Carsus was merely out of greed to absorb the neighboring domain.
            Offering such a land in exchange for military provisions worth a
            hundred thousand gold coins was a deal no one would oppose.
          </p>
          <p>
            -But I am unsure what will happen after I ascend to the throne. If I
            propose a new law to emancipate the slaves, the opposition will be
            formidable.
          </p>
          <p>That was Yubel’s concern.</p>
          <p>
            Truthfully, Yubel himself wanted to free the non-human races from
            slavery as soon as possible. It was the only way he could live
            openly and happily with Finia. He didn’t even aspire to make her his
            queen; he just wished to keep her by his side, even if only as a
            concubine.
          </p>
          <p>
            But realistically, it’s impossible. Even if he becomes king, he
            cannot wield absolute power. There are numerous nobles, rigid
            traditions, and a populace that still perceives other races as
            nothing more than slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Can he truly overcome all these and achieve his desired outcome?
          </p>
          <p>
            It was natural for Yubel to be skeptical. Even Finia, a dwarf,
            expressed doubts about the feasibility of it all.
          </p>
          <p>
            “However, once the autonomous regions are legally recognized, it’s
            not entirely impossible.”
          </p>
          <p>Walking along with Siris, Repenhardt spoke calmly.</p>
          <p>
            “After all, an autonomous region is an autonomous region. Whether
            they bake bread with stones or stir it with a claymore, it’s an
            internal matter, and external concerns would be interference. Once
            the system is set up, I think it can somehow work out. It’ll be a
            headache in various ways, though.”
          </p>

          <p>
            In his previous life, Repenhardt did not care about human opinions.
            He pushed everything through with force. While this made things
            proceed smoothly, it also caused severe side effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This time, we must go slowly but surely. In a way that humans
            cannot deny.”
          </p>
          <p>“That makes sense…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris nodded. There seemed to be humans who would agree with his
            views, and his methods seemed realistic. If successful, at least the
            first step would be viable.
          </p>
          <p>Then, a question suddenly arose.</p>
          <p>“Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>“Yes?”</p>
          <p>“Did you know Prince Yubel from before?”</p>
          <p>
            “No, this is the first time I’ve seen his face. I only heard rumors
            before.”
          </p>
          <p>“Who won in the previous life then?”</p>
          <p>
            It was a trivial issue, but still, curiosity lingered. Repenhardt
            smirked and responded without hesitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Prince Carsus. In fact, in the previous life, Prince Yubel vanished
            like dew on the scaffold.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And Prince Yubel would end up disappearing from history as a royal
            embarrassment with depraved hobbies. Originally, Prince Carsus was
            to become the king of the Crovence Kingdom. Hearing this, Siris
            frowned.
          </p>
          <p>“…It’s not going to unfold according to history, is it?”</p>
          <p>“If I hadn’t intervened, it would have.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt replied confidently. Of course, even he felt uncertain
            about what outcomes his significant interventions in history might
            bring. But…
          </p>
          <p>
            “Actually, this is normal. Knowing what the future holds is actually
            abnormal.”
          </p>
          <p>After all, it’s a reversed time.</p>
          <p>After all, it’s a newly written history.</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had already altered the known history from the moment he
            returned to this era, turning it into a past that no longer existed.
            It was no different from the fanciful stories concocted by
            minstrels.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am already living a new life, building hope for the unseen
            future, striving best as I can, just like everyone else,” Repenhardt
            murmured as if singing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sirius nodded at Repenhardt’s murmured words and whispered softly,
            “I hope it goes well.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “We have to make it work. And I believe it will turn out quite well
            if humans start seeing orcs, elves, and dwarves not as slaves, but
            as comrades in arms.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked up at the cloudy sky, the last conversation with
            Yubel still circling in his mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Your Majesty Yubel, I have something to discuss regarding the
            forces assisting you.
          </p>
          <p>-What is it?</p>
          <p>
            -They are orcs, dwarves, and elves. I am here representing their
            will.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The rest of the group was staying at a small inn on the outskirts of
            the village. When Repenhardt and Sirius entered, they were greeted
            by Sillan, Russ, and Tilla gathered in the hall.
          </p>
          <p>“Did the discussion go well, hyung?”</p>
          <p>“It’s going so-so? Seems to be going well so far.”</p>
          <p>
            The group gathered around the fireplace in the hall, huddling close
            together. Russ muttered with an expression mixed with admiration.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re starting off on quite an ambitious note, hyung.”</p>
          <p>
            It had been a month since they left Grand Forge. During that time,
            Repenhardt’s party had been frantically exploring various ruins
            across the regions. They had explored a total of ten sites so far!
            It would be more accurate to say they had pillaged rather than
            explored. After all, it wasn’t truly exploration since Repenhardt
            already knew all the information.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No one would believe us if we said we explored a ruin every three
            days. But it wasn’t entirely impossible either.” With the aura
            wielder Russ and the dwarf warrior Tilla joining, and Repenhardt
            having regained some of his magical powers, they had more than
            enough ability to conduct the explorations. Having the official
            answer sheet, so to speak, allowed them to save a lot of time. They
            were able to plunder the relics like a whirlwind.
          </p>
          <p>Russ smirked as he recalled those days.</p>
          <p>
            “Honestly, it was tougher hauling out relics than dealing with
            demons in the ruins.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, as they plundered various places, the number of their
            Infinite Pouches, which compressed contents nearly tenfold, had
            significantly increased. They now had more than ten such pouches.
            But no matter how much they reduced the volume and weight, the sheer
            amount they had to carry around was undeniably cumbersome.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan nodded in understanding at Russ’s words.</p>
          <p>
            “That’s right. It’s a good thing I’ve been building my muscles.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “…Really? If someone who can carry one water jug can now carry two,
            I don’t see much of a difference.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh! But soon, I’ll be able to carry three!”</p>

          <p>“It’s still just water jugs, isn’t it?”</p>
          <p>
            Russ and Sillan exchanged jokes and laughed. Repenhardt let out a
            baffled chuckle.
          </p>
          <p>“…Anyway, I ended up carrying more than half of it myself…”</p>
          <p>
            Thus, having salvaged a wealth of relics from the Silver Age,
            Repenhardt was able to amass a considerable fortune by selling the
            more valuable items to the Taoban Trading Company. They had not just
            collected relics from ten sites, but had thoroughly scraped them
            clean, making the total sum substantial. Moreover, the fifteen
            hundred gold coins he had invested in the Taoban Trading Company had
            multiplied in value, thanks to the famine, now amounting to over
            thirty thousand gold coins. Even after allocating shares to Sillan
            and Russ, Repenhardt’s total assets were nearing sixty thousand gold
            coins. Both of them also had about ten thousand gold coins each
            deposited with the Taoban Trading Company.
          </p>
          <p>Russ, caressing his sword, smiled.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s not just about the money, but I’m more pleased about the
            opportunity to earn fame, hyung.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After wrapping up their relic-looting expeditions, Repenhardt’s
            party had entered the Kingdom of Crovence and he shared his plan to
            join the civil war with his companions. Sirius and Tilla would have
            no reason to object, but Repenhardt was a bit worried about how Russ
            and Sillan would react; surprisingly, both showed enthusiasm and
            agreed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I have already sworn to follow you, hyung. Besides, gaining renown
            is inevitable if I am to return to my family. If I can elevate my
            name on the battlefield, my goal will come nearer,” was Russ’s
            response.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve already agreed with Mr. Repen’s intentions, didn’t I? Why
            bring it up now? Besides, while exploring ruins is fine, a pilgrim
            should really be among the people,” was Sillan’s reply.
          </p>
          <p>
            With both readily agreeing to follow Repenhardt, there were no
            hesitations left. Repenhardt’s party immediately headed to find
            Yubel in the Viscountcy of Delphia and successfully met with Prince
            Yubel as planned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just then, the innkeeper came into the hall carrying a generous
            spread of food.
          </p>
          <p>“The meal is ready. Please eat your fill~.”</p>
          <p>
            Thanks to Repenhardt’s group being connected to the Taoban Trading
            Company, the inn was enjoying an unexpected windfall. Knowing full
            well that there was no food, Repenhardt had made a request from the
            start to have all the necessary ingredients delivered here through
            the Taoban Trading Company. For them, it was as if food had
            miraculously fallen from the sky. Currently, in the Kingdom of
            Crovence, food was even more precious than money. The innkeepers
            treated Repenhardt’s group as if they were saviors descended from
            heaven.
          </p>
          <p>“Please let us know if you need anything at all.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, thank you for your efforts.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan, polite as ever, represented the group in offering their
            thanks. As the landlady modestly retreated, the group began their
            long-delayed dinner. Midway through gulping down ale, Sillan
            suddenly asked.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, Mr. Repen. There’s something I’m curious about.”</p>
          <p>“Hmm? What is it?”</p>
          <p>“Did we actually have a hundred thousand gold pieces?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan had calculated, and all their assets combined did not exceed
            eighty thousand gold pieces. Yet, Repenhardt confidently declared
            one hundred thousand. With Finia present, it couldn’t have been a
            lie. But given Repenhardt’s nature, it seemed unlikely he would
            secretly hoard funds. Hence the confusion.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt grinned.</p>
          <p>
            “So it’s not actually ‘one hundred thousand gold pieces’, but ‘grain
            worth one hundred thousand gold pieces’.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Taoban Trading Company was currently reaping massive profits
            thanks to Repenhardt’s investment. Amazed by Repenhardt’s actions in
            the Duchy of Chatan—where he mercilessly killed the second-largest
            trading guild’s leader—Siebolt recognized his exceptional insight
            and decided to invest all available resources to buy grain and
            transfer it to the Kingdom of Crovence. Had a famine not occurred,
            such an act would have been financially suicidal, but Siebolt boldly
            executed the plan. It was a gamble based on viewing it as a
            once-in-a-lifetime opportunity; if not for Repenhardt, they would
            have been doomed either way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, the gamble paid off, and Siebolt quickly became the
            owner of the second-largest guild in the Duchy of Chatan.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was natural for Siebolt to feel gratitude and awe towards
            Repenhardt. However, this didn’t mean he foolishly made Repenhardt
            the owner of the trading company. No matter how grateful he was, he
            remained a businessman. Instead, he promised that Repenhardt could
            purchase grain at the original cost price, not the current market
            price—a merchant’s way of repaying someone who had greatly helped
            and expanded the guild.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, the ‘grain worth one hundred thousand gold pieces’
            that Repenhardt mentioned was, in reality, an amount that could be
            bought for merely three to four thousand gold pieces.

          <p>[ Chapter 104 ]</p>
          <p>
            In other words, the ‘grain equivalent to a hundred thousand gold
            coins’ that Repenhardt mentioned was, in reality, an amount that
            could be purchased for merely three or four thousand gold coins at
            most.
          </p>
          <p>After hearing the story, Tilla clicked her tongue.</p>
          <p>“That sounds like a scam.”</p>
          <p>
            Wasn’t it completely rigged gambling? Repenhardt shrugged his
            shoulders.
          </p>
          <p>“So what? I didn’t lie, did I?”</p>
          <p>
            Even Finia couldn’t find any falsehood in his words, so it certainly
            wasn’t a lie. Contrary to what one might think, it seemed Repenhardt
            had a knack for swindling. While snickering, Russ suddenly hardened
            his expression and asked,
          </p>
          <p>“I have a question, brother.”</p>
          <p>Chewing on a chicken leg, Repenhardt turned to look at Russ.</p>
          <p>“You mentioned six Aura users, didn’t you?”</p>
          <p>“That’s right.”</p>
          <p>Russ started counting on his fingers.</p>
          <p>“You, me, and the three Dwarf Aura users…”</p>
          <p>
            Having folded all the fingers on his right hand, Russ looked
            puzzled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But that’s only five. Is there an Aura user among the Elves that I
            don’t know about?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, of course, there are Aura users among the Elves, but…”</p>
          <p>
            He remembered only one Elf Aura user. And that Elf Aura user wasn’t
            exactly on friendly terms with Repenhardt, the former Demon King, in
            his past life. They were allies, but not friends, something like
            that?
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘He’s a tough one to persuade, so meeting him at this point would
            be…’
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt shrugged his shoulders.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s not an Elf. And I’m not included in that number. I’m only
            working behind the scenes; I have no intention of stepping forward.”
          </p>
          <p>Russ tilted his head, even more confused.</p>
          <p>“Then we’re still short by two.”</p>

          <p>
            Repenhardt gulped down a mug of ale. After quenching his thirst, his
            eyes sparkled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s alright. The Orc Great Warrior, Kalkan, and Stala will join
            us.”
          </p>
          <p>“…Orcs? Are there Aura users among the Orcs?”</p>
          <p>
            Not only Russ but also Sillan looked surprised. Despite being
            another slave race, the perception of Orcs being stupid was strong
            compared to Elves or Dwarves. And in truth, many of them were indeed
            below average in intelligence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Could there really be an Orc who had awakened the spirit of the
            Great Sword?
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensing their astonished gazes, Repenhardt slowly began to speak.
          </p>
          <p>
            “About a fifteen-day journey southeast of the Rakid Mountains,
            there’s a wasteland. It’s called the Land of Trials by non-human
            races. There are Orcs there who have preserved their ancient
            traditions.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Not slaves who had lost all their wildness, nor were they gladiator
            orcs who had grown savage and brutal, but those who combined
            intellect and savagery in a delicate balance, maintaining the spirit
            of a proud warrior.
          </p>
          <p>“They are called the Blue Bear Tribe.”</p>
          <p>
            And the leaders of these orcs were the great orc gladiators, Kalken
            and Stala. This couple, even in their previous lives, had led
            Repenhardt’s army with tremendous combat prowess despite their
            advanced age.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this era, they possessed the bodies of their prime. Even
            Repenhardt couldn’t fathom how strong they had become.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Now that I think about it, Tassid would be there as well. Has that
            guy grown much?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt reminisced about the fierce orc warrior and the frail
            young orc boy from his past life, smiling nostalgically.
          </p>
          <p>Russ shook his head in disbelief.</p>
          <p>
            “Of course, some orc gladiators seemed quite capable… but are orcs
            truly that strong?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt spoke firmly with a serious expression.</p>
          <p>
            “As far as I know, they are the strongest combat group on earth.
            This includes humans, elves, and dwarves!”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            At the northernmost part of the Graim Kingdom, in the eternal
            permafrost of Friesland.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the desolate valleys of the vast snowfield, a group of ten
            people was camping. They had set up three tents made of thick fur
            hides and used the cliffs of the valley to block the wind, huddling
            around a bonfire to escape the northern winds.
          </p>
          <p>
            An old man wearing a thick fur hat shivered, blowing white breath
            from his chapped lips.
          </p>
          <p>“Phew, phew… It’s cold.”</p>
          <p>
            A burly man, also warming himself by the fire, questioned the old
            man.
          </p>

          <p>“Can’t you increase the heat, Mage Hal?”</p>
          <p>
            Though it was called a bonfire, there were no logs to fuel the
            flames. In this endless snowfield, not even a single twig existed.
            And with limited carrying capacity, they couldn’t bring logs with
            them. Hence, they relied on Hal’s magical flames to fend off the
            cold.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Be patient. We need to keep the fire burning all night; I can’t
            waste my magic power now.”
          </p>
          <p>“I see.”</p>
          <p>
            They were an expedition team from the Graim Kingdom led by Mage Hal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mage Hal, who was turning fifty-seven this year, was a renowned
            ruins explorer. His magical ability was at the latter part of the
            6th circle, which could be considered average for his age. However,
            Hal’s skill in decoding ancient languages and interpreting
            information was unparalleled.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had already explored three ruins and was renowned for his
            accomplishments. This time, his challenge was a dungeon located in
            the remote wilderness of Friesland, Salkana.
          </p>
          <p>
            After half a year of preparation, Hal led the expedition team to
            this frozen land. For two months, they endured countless hardships,
            and now, they were on their way back after exploring the Salkana
            ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaron, the burly sub-leader of the expedition and a seasoned
            swordsman, glanced around the campsite as he warmed himself by the
            fire. Each of the three small campfires lit by Hal had three or four
            people huddled around, shivering. The thick frost on their hair and
            beards starkly displayed the severity of the cold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aaron lamented as he muttered, “We came with over thirty people, but
            only ten have survived…”
          </p>
          <p>Recalling the journey, Aaron shuddered.</p>
          <p>
            Most of the Silver Age ruins were located in extremely remote areas.
            However, Friesland was in a class of its own.
          </p>
          <p>The ferocious cold that seemed to freeze even one’s blood.</p>
          <p>The relentless snowstorms that never ceased.</p>
          <p>
            The vast, unending snowy plains that broke even the strongest wills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Friesland’s horrific natural environment was a monster in itself.
            Just reaching the Salkana dungeon through this terrain cost them
            three comrades. If Hal’s expedition team had not been veterans who
            had experienced three other dungeons, they would never have made it
            to Salkana.
          </p>
          <p>
            Terrifying magical traps and powerful monsters they had never faced
            before forced Hal’s expedition team to taste hell. Though they
            managed to progress to the dungeon’s midpoint, they lost numerous
            comrades, including powerful mages and clerics. It was sheer luck
            that they were not wiped out and managed to escape the dungeon.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The losses are too great,” Aaron sighed, thinking of their fallen
            comrades.
          </p>
          <p>His words brought somber expressions to everyone’s faces.</p>
          <p>Hal, smiling weakly, encouraged them all.</p>
          <p>“Still, didn’t we gain a lot from this expedition?”</p>
          <p>
            At that, smiles slowly returned to everyone’s faces despite their
            hardships.
          </p>

          <p>
            They had suffered heavy losses and managed to explore only about
            half of the Salkana dungeon, which was a formidable place. But the
            rewards were equally immense.
          </p>
          <p>
            The expedition members warming themselves by the fire looked toward
            the tents with satisfied expressions. Inside, there were more than
            ten infinite pouches filled with artifacts from the Silver Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing the loot, Aaron’s voice brightened, feeling a bit more
            energetic.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, this haul is far greater than all the artifacts we’ve
            collected so far combined.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Because it was located in such a remote region, the Salkana Dungeon
            contained many mysterious artifacts that had never been discovered
            before. The supposedly rare infinite pouches were common, and they
            acquired numerous powerful magic swords and armors. Each item was
            among the highest tier of artifacts from the Silver Age. If they
            were to put these on the market, they would amass an enormous
            fortune. The amount was enough for every survivor to retire and live
            in luxury for the rest of their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, at this moment, the price of those artifacts meant nothing
            to Mage Hal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hal suddenly reached into his bosom. Despite shivering in the cold,
            the old man wore an expression full of joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hehehe, if this is presented to the academy, it will cause a
            tremendous stir.”
          </p>
          <p>
            What he was touching was one of the books discovered in the Salkana
            ruins. Hal’s party had also found several tablets and faded books in
            Salkana. The other members showed no interest in these seemingly
            worthless artifacts, but to Hal, they were worth more than gold.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘The ancient language is too advanced to fully decipher, but I could
            infer some of the content just by skimming through it.’
          </p>
          <p>
            This book contained records of the mysterious ancients from the
            Silver Age, shrouded in secrecy!
          </p>
          <p>
            The Silver Age, a distant ancient time, perhaps thousands or even
            tens of thousands of years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the artifacts from that era have eroded and faded away with
            the passage of time, leaving only a few behind. Those that are
            discovered tend to be highly durable artifacts. Military weapons are
            built with durability in mind, so the artifacts found in dungeons
            usually possess combat capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the Salkana Dungeon was different. The harsh environment of
            Friesland was the worst for life to survive in, but it was the best
            for preserving artifacts. Historical records from the Silver Age,
            which would have normally left no trace, were perfectly preserved.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘As soon as we return, I must dedicate myself to decoding these
            records. I will unveil the secrets of the Silver Age and those
            ancient people. If that happens… hehehe.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being an old man, Hal’s heart was pounding fiercely like a
            young man’s. He couldn’t help but be excited. He couldn’t even begin
            to imagine the immense honor that would be bestowed upon him if he
            presented these findings. As a scholar, he might achieve immortal
            fame in human history!
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s hurry back to the Kingdom of Graim. I am eager to present our
            findings to the academy as soon as possible.”
          </p>
          <p>Seeing Hal urging them on, everyone agreed.</p>
          <p>“Of course.”</p>
          <p>
            Though they were not scholars, the others were equally excited about
            the bright future ahead. Dreaming of becoming wealthy by selling the
            artifacts, the expedition members joyfully patted each other on the
            back.
          </p>
          <p>“Um?”</p>
          <p>
            One of the expedition members looked across the valley, tilting his
            head in confusion. In the fierce north wind and the thick snowstorm,
            a shadowy figure appeared.
          </p>
          <p>Everyone stood up in surprise.</p>
          <p>“What, what is that?”</p>
          <p>
            The shadow multiplied. There were now four figures, and everyone
            looked shocked.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this harsh environment of Friesland, not even monsters could
            survive. There was no way any other living beings could be here.
            Yet, someone had approached their campsite!
          </p>
          <p>
            They all wore confused expressions, wondering if they were seeing
            things. Aaron drew his sword and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Who goes there?”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 105 ]</p>
          <p>
            The shadow revealed itself. It was a young man with black hair and
            black eyes, possessing astonishing beauty.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment Hal saw the young man’s attire, he doubted his eyes. The
            young man wore ordinary leather armor with a cloak draped over his
            shoulders and a long sword at his waist. While such attire was
            common in the city, this place was the eternal permafrost,
            Friesland.
          </p>
          <p>‘How can he remain so calm in this cold with that attire!?’</p>
          <p>
            Following him, the forms of other shadows became clear. There was a
            red-haired woman in a reddish robe, a young man in his twenties clad
            in pitch-black full-body armor, and a blonde knight in golden armor
            shining from head to toe.
          </p>
          <p>
            None of them were dressed to withstand this cold. They weren’t even
            wearing fur coats. Yet, none of them showed any signs of feeling
            cold.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone was so astonished that they just blinked in disbelief.
            Aaron, barely regaining his composure, asked.
          </p>
          <p>“W-Who are you? And how did you get here?”</p>
          <p>
            The young man stared intently at Aaron. Suddenly, a yellowish light
            filled Aaron’s vision.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Aaron’s eyes widened. At the same time, a red line slowly appeared
            on his neck. Blood started to trickle from the red line, and then
            his head slid off and fell.
          </p>
          <p>Thud!</p>
          <p>
            Aaron’s head rolled across the frozen ground. Due to the extreme
            cold, the blood flowed for only a moment before freezing solid.
          </p>
          <p>A moment later, Hal screamed.</p>
          <p>“Ah, ahhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Aaron was dead! The other members of the expedition team finally
            came to their senses and hurriedly drew their weapons.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaron hyung!”</p>
          <p>“Enemies!”</p>
          <p>“They’re robbers after the relics!”</p>
          <p>
            The members of the expedition team, now understanding the situation,
            charged at the young man in a fury. The young man glanced at his
            companions behind him and coldly ordered.
          </p>
          <p>“Kill them all.”</p>
          <p>
            The young man in black armor and the golden knight responded
            simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes!”</p>
          <p>“At your command!”</p>
          <p>
            The two knights drew their swords and charged at the expedition
            members. Black blades danced, and the golden longsword sprayed
            blood. Screams erupted continuously as dark red blood and bright red
            entrails spilled everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>“Gah!”</p>
          <p>
            In an instant, the expedition members fell, bleeding. Hal,
            panicking, began to prepare a spell.
          </p>
          <p>“By the thunder of the sky, Thunderbolt Arrow!”</p>
          <p>
            The 3rd circle lightning spell, Thunderbolt Arrow, formed in Hal’s
            wrinkled hand, discharging electricity. Just as he was about to cast
            the spell, the robed woman chanted in a clear voice, forming hand
            seals.
          </p>

          <p>“Flow of destruction, follow the natural order! Evasion Road!”</p>
          <p>
            A grey magical staff materialized in front of the woman, absorbing
            all the lightning arrows. Hal’s complexion turned pale. The magic
            she used was a third-circle mana absorption spell. She was a mage on
            par with Hal, despite her youthful appearance.
          </p>
          <p>“This, this can’t be!”</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, the expedition members were dying. They, too, were
            seasoned combatants through dungeon explorations, yet none could
            stand against the two swordsmen. They could only die with eyes wide
            open in resentment, becoming cold corpses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Within mere minutes, all the expedition members except Hal were
            dead. Hal, terrified, shouted at the young man.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you want the artifacts, take them all! I’ll give them all to
            you!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The young man approached Hal with a bitter smile. Hal retreated,
            clutching the book in his arms.
          </p>
          <p>‘No, this can’t be…….’</p>
          <p>
            He didn’t care about the artifacts. But he couldn’t die without
            revealing the great truth he had discovered, this historical record.
            Hal pleaded.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Please, spare my life. Killing an old man like me won’t benefit you
            in any way.”
          </p>
          <p>At that moment, the young man spoke.</p>
          <p>“I’m sorry, mage.”</p>
          <p>
            The young man raised his longsword. His cold voice pierced Hal’s
            ears.
          </p>
          <p>“The reason we came is actually because of you.”</p>
          <p>
            The cold blade plunged deep into Hal’s abdomen. Excruciating pain
            struck his brain, and a scream erupted.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaargh!”</p>
          <p>☆ ☆ ☆</p>
          <p>
            A cold north wind swept through the valley filled with corpses,
            spreading its chill. A woman in a robe, watching the gruesome scene,
            called out to the black-haired young man.
          </p>
          <p>“Teslon…….”</p>
          <p>
            Philane approached Teslon with a sullen face. She asked, almost
            whining.
          </p>
          <p>“Did it really have to be this way?”</p>
          <p>“It was the command of the Sage of Silver.”</p>
          <p>Teslon replied in a stiff voice as he approached Hal’s corpse.</p>
          <p>“They opened a door that should not have been opened.”</p>
          <p>
            Ignoring Philane’s sorrowful expression, the young man, Teslon,
            searched the corpse. He retrieved a tattered book and put it in his
            robe, continuing.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is a history that must not be known. Everything is for the
            protection of humanity.”
          </p>
          <p>Philane looked puzzled.</p>
          <p>
            “Of course, I’ve heard the Sage of Silver is the protector of
            humanity… but still, these innocent people…….”
          </p>
          <p>“It’s just a small sacrifice for the greater good of humanity.”</p>
          <p>
            Teslon cut off Philane’s words with a cold voice. At that moment, a
            knight in black armor approached Teslon. Teslon looked at him and
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>“What do you think, Stefan? How is the Berserker Armor?”</p>

          <p>The black knight replied with a sly grin.</p>
          <p>“It couldn’t be better, Sir Teslon.”</p>
          <p>
            The black knight was Stefan von Lepanto Artion, the second son of
            the Marquis of Artion and holder of the title of Viscount Lepanto.
          </p>
          <p>
            While searching for his ancestral demon sword, Artion, Stefan had
            encountered the hidden Fist King, Repenhardt. This meeting left him
            consumed by feelings of inferiority, driving him to a life of
            indulgence and vice. Witnessing someone his age already reach the
            peak as an aura user made all his training feel pointless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once a promising knight known as the Knight of Resolve in the Vasily
            Kingdom, Stefan became a ruin, forgotten, with only a vague
            resentment toward Repenhardt to console him as he drowned his
            sorrows in alcohol.
          </p>
          <p>It was then that Teslon, the Sage of Silver, approached Stefan.</p>
          <p>
            Teslon promised him great power, power that would rival that of aura
            users, if he followed him. Power that would allow him to defeat
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>The gift he received was this pitch-black full-body armor.</p>
          <p>
            An exceptional artifact rivaling the magic armor Eldrad, the
            Berserker Armor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike Eldrad, which enabled the use of various spells, the
            Berserker Armor had a single defining feature.
          </p>
          <p>
            It made the wearer endlessly fast, strong, durable, and tireless.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stefan was utterly captivated by the power of this armor, which
            allowed him to fight like a legendary berserker while maintaining a
            clear mind. With newfound hope, he gave up his vices. He dedicated
            all his time to mastering the Berserker Armor.
          </p>
          <p>‘Though I have yet to completely master the Berserker Armor…….’</p>
          <p>
            The day this armor fully became his, that arrogant commoner aura
            user would be kneeling at his feet!
          </p>
          <p>
            As Stefan clenched his teeth in thoughts of revenge, a calm voice
            reached him.
          </p>
          <p>“You are not the only one who dreams of revenge, Sir Stefan.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, Sir Eusus.”</p>
          <p>
            Stefan turned to look at the knight in golden armor with a bitter
            smile. Indeed, he was not the only one seeking vengeance against
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus von Tenes, the Golden Knight of Graim, renowned far and wide.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, his fame had considerably dimmed, thanks to a humiliating
            defeat at the hands of Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing Eusus, who also entrusted himself to Teslon, Stefan’s gaze
            softened.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you hurt, Sir Eusus?”</p>
          <p>
            “Haha, Sir Stefan. No matter what, do you think I would get hurt by
            such rabble?”
          </p>
          <p>“Indeed.”</p>
          <p>
            Though they were technically rivals, Stefan and Eusus got along
            quite well. Being in similar circumstances and sharing a common
            enemy, they couldn’t help but feel a sense of camaraderie.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, unlike Repenhardt, who was considered a mere commoner,
            Eusus hailed from a highly esteemed noble lineage and possessed
            significant renown. To Stefan, a nobleman to his core, Eusus was
            truly “someone worthy of friendship.”
          </p>
          <p>“By the way…”</p>
          <p>
            Approaching Teslon, Eusus reverted the magic armor Eldrad to its
            sheathed form. Once nearly destroyed by Repenhardt, Eldrad had been
            fully restored thanks to its self-repair ability and an artifact
            from the Silver Age that Teslon had provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shedding his armor and feeling lighter, Eusus marveled as he looked
            around.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This Necklace of Warmth is truly effective. Even in this blizzard,
            it feels like a spring breeze.”
          </p>

          <p>
            The Necklace of Warmth, worn by everyone in Teslon’s group, was a
            Silver Age artifact that maintained a constant body temperature in
            any cold. It was an item known only to the Sages of Silver, never
            revealed to the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus glanced at the infinite pouches scattered inside the tent and
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>“What should we do with these artifacts, Sir Teslon?”</p>
          <p>
            “Take what’s useful and sell the rest. But those listed must be
            retrieved and kept by the Sage of Silver.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Teslon recalled the list he had memorized. Among the artifacts from
            this Salkana Dungeon, some were never to be permitted for the
            current humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Sage of Silver has the mission of protecting humanity from
            ancient evils. Many of these Silver Age artifacts possess dangerous
            capabilities, and if not properly managed by the rightful custodian,
            chaos would ensue.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Teslon spoke, Eusus fiddled with the necklace around his neck,
            puzzled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I understand that, but what’s the criteria? Honestly, it doesn’t
            make sense…”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Necklace of Warmth was undoubtedly a remarkable item. But was it
            so dangerous that it couldn’t be allowed for humanity? How could it
            be that artifacts like the magic armor Eldrad and the Berserker
            Armor were released to the world, yet the Necklace of Warmth wasn’t?
            Eusus couldn’t wrap his head around it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teslon inwardly smirked at Eusus’s expression. In truth, he also
            didn’t fully understand the criteria the Sages of Silver used to
            determine the significance of the artifacts. Despite being a Sage
            himself, Teslon knew less about their secrets than he knew.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Teslon couldn’t show any uncertainty, so he ignored it and
            started rummaging through the infinite pouches. As he sorted through
            the artifacts according to the pre-received list, Eusus’s eyes
            suddenly lit up.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm? Isn’t this the Voice of Elucion, Sir Teslon?”</p>
          <p>
            In Eusus’s hand was a square black block. Teslon asked curiously.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmm? It’s just a black square block, isn’t it? Why do you think
            it’s the Voice of Elucion?”
          </p>
          <p>“Well…”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus pointed to the ancient script engraved on the side of the
            block.
          </p>
          <p>“The markings here are identical.”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus, though lacking in knowledge of ancient languages, possessed a
            knight’s keen eye. He couldn’t read the script, but he could
            recognize identical “pictures.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Teslon let out a slight groan. Was the Voice of Elucion also an
            artifact that shouldn’t be revealed to modern humanity? It seemed
            plausible, considering how much the Demon King Repenhardt valued it.
          </p>
          <p>“I didn’t know there was another one.”</p>
          <p>
            Half-heartedly answering, Teslon started to sort out the Voice of
            Elucion, but suddenly his eyes sparkled.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If the Demon King valued it so much, this must be no ordinary
            artifact…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Sneakily, Teslon pocketed the black block, glancing at the others.
            Then, gathering the infinite pouches, he spoke to his group.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s head back. Even after returning what we owe to the Sage of
            Silver, there will be plenty of artifacts left.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Teslon made a joke, the response was tepid. Everyone came
            from well-off families, so acquiring many artifacts wasn’t
            particularly thrilling. Moreover, the massacre of innocents, even
            under the Sage’s command, left them feeling uneasy.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they prepared to return with somber expressions, Philane muttered
            quietly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “…What kind of history must never be known that they go to such
            lengths, these Sages of Silver?”
          </p>
          <p>Watching her, Teslon bit his lip.</p>
          <p>“Do not seek to know, do not be interested, Philane.”</p>
          <p>Indeed, it must never be known.</p>
          <p>The unknown history.</p>
          <p>
            The truth about the elves, dwarves, orcs, and trolls, who are now
            mere slave races.
          </p>
          <p>
            The truth about them would only endanger modern humanity. It’s a
            truth that offers no benefit to the humans who rule the world.
          </p>
          <p>Teslon solemnly declared.</p>
          <p>
            “The only ones who have the right to know are the Sages of Silver.”

          <p>[ Chapter 106 ]</p>
          <p>
            The enormous Gloten mountain range formed the eastern border between
            the Kingdom of Crovence and the Vasily Kingdom. Beyond its rugged
            peaks lay vast grasslands. This expansive plain, where the horizon
            was marked by endless flatlands and rocky mountains, remained
            largely untouched by human hands—this was the Fetland Plain.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the relatively habitable areas near the mountains, which featured
            small valleys and lakes suitable for cultivation, a few human
            villages still remained. These villages, established along the
            pathway leading to the kingdom’s border gates, were home to nomads
            and traveling merchants. They roamed the arid wilderness herding
            sheep and goats or made their living trading with the border guards
            stationed at the gates.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, even they did not venture further east. The harsh climate,
            with its extreme temperature fluctuations between day and night, and
            the presence of monsters that frequently preyed on their sheep and
            goats, made it an unbearable place for even the most resilient
            nomads. Hence, the eastern part of the Fetland Plain was referred to
            as Deathland, or “Death’s Land” in the nomads’ language, and was
            strictly avoided.
          </p>
          <p>
            No shepherd, no matter how brave, ventured into the eastern part of
            the Fetland Plain, the desolate Deathland.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet now, a flock of sheep and goats grazed peacefully in that very
            Deathland. Nearby, a large figure sat on a rock, shirtless, casually
            observing them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a human saw this, they would have doubted their eyes. Deathland
            was teeming not with mere wild beasts, but with powerful creatures
            worthy of being called monsters. No shepherd would dare bring their
            flock here, even if every other pasture had dried up.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this man maintained a serene expression even in this
            perilous place. And upon closer inspection, it wasn’t so strange.
          </p>
          <p>He wasn’t human—he was an orc.</p>
          <p>
            Standing nearly two meters tall, with rough, green skin like the
            bark of a tree, a flat nose, and tusks jutting out from his lower
            jaw like those of a boar, this orc had all the characteristic
            features of his kind. Yet, his features were somehow well-defined
            and balanced, making him not appear overly ferocious. By human
            standards, he might even be considered ruggedly handsome.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he watched the goats diligently nibbling at the sparse grass, the
            green-skinned orc stretched languidly.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, there’s no news today either.”</p>
          <p>
            At the sound of his voice, a large wolf’s head suddenly emerged from
            beneath the rock. This fearsome-looking wolf was enormous. A
            direwolf, standing 1.2 meters tall and reaching 3 meters in length,
            it was a monster that could snap up a bull in one bite.
          </p>
          <p>
            This ferocious monster approached the orc man and, like a dog, began
            nuzzling its head against him, whining softly.
          </p>
          <p>“Yip, yip.”</p>
          <p>
            “Hey! You little rascal! You haven’t done anything and you’re
            already looking for food?”
          </p>
          <p>
            When he tapped its head lightly, it whimpered like a real dog and
            curled its tail. Watching the direwolf crouch at his feet, the orc
            man clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “…Seriously, why has the former king of the plains become so
            submissive?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The direwolf lifted its head, stuck out its tongue as if saying,
            ‘Well, that didn’t work,’ and confidently descended under the rock.
            The orc man clicked his tongue again.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh, that cunning beast.”</p>

          <p>
            It had been half a year since he tamed this black-furred direwolf,
            Black King. For an orc, taming a direwolf was proof of being an
            honorable warrior. All orcs dream of becoming wolf riders, but only
            a true warrior can mark themselves on these ferocious monsters and
            make them follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had chased the Black King, known as the king of the plains, for a
            week, endured its counterattacks for three days, and after a
            half-day battle, he finally subdued the Black King. He imprinted his
            warrior spirit on the Black King, making it follow him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up to this point, everything was good. However, this Black King was
            different from other direwolves. Was it too intelligent? It
            understood words perfectly and behaved like a human, but to an
            excessive degree, to the point of being cheeky.
          </p>
          <p>‘Sometimes, I feel like I’m the one who got tricked…’</p>
          <p>Shaking his head, the orc man suddenly looked up sharply.</p>
          <p>“Hmm?”</p>
          <p>
            The Black King, descending under the rock, perked up its ears as
            well. Both stood up simultaneously. At this sight, two other orc men
            who were tending the sheep a bit further away ran over with startled
            faces.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
          <p>“Has it finally appeared, Tassid?”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs all stared in the direction Tassid was looking. Sure
            enough, after a moment, a large shadow emerged from the other side
            of the rocky hills. It was a Turtle Lion, a carnivorous monster with
            the body of a turtle and the head and limbs of a lion. It seemed to
            be quite old, appearing nearly twice the size of the Black King.
          </p>
          <p>Roar!</p>
          <p>
            The Turtle Lion roared and started charging towards the sheep. The
            sheep and goats, frozen by the roar, stood still in a daze, unable
            to think of running away. This monster, which had evolved in the
            arid climate to reduce moisture evaporation, might look laughable at
            first glance, but it was far from an easy opponent. It combined the
            defense of a turtle and the attack power of a lion, a formidable
            monster capable of easily sweeping away dozens of human soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>However, the orcs did not seem too tense.</p>
          <p>
            Orc warrior Tassid picked up the giant zhanmadao placed beside him
            and grinned.
          </p>
          <p>“Black King!”</p>
          <p>
            As if waiting for this command, the direwolf lay down at Tassid’s
            feet. Grabbing the reins and swiftly mounting Black King, Tassid
            shouted in Orcish as he spurred the beast forward.
          </p>
          <p>“Talkra! Ketchatraka!”</p>
          <p>
            Translated, it meant something like, ‘Food’s here! Light the fire!’
            Riding atop Black King, Tassid galloped across the plain at a fierce
            speed, raising his rough zhanmadao high and shouting loudly.
          </p>
          <p>“Dakar!”</p>
          <p>
            He called the name of the zhanmadao to awaken the soul of the
            weapon. Tassid’s beloved blade, Dakar, began to emit a faint light
            along its blade. This was an orc warrior’s unique technique,
            entirely different from an aura, where instead of infusing the blade
            with one’s energy, one drew out the sword’s own spirit. The once
            dull blade of Dakar sharpened to a razor edge, exuding a chilling
            aura.
          </p>

          <p>
            Merging his spirit with that of the blade, Tassid charged toward the
            Turtle Lion like a storm. Just as the Turtle Lion was about to
            pounce on a goat, Tassid swiftly intercepted it. The Turtle Lion
            roared with anger and wariness.
          </p>
          <p>“Grrraaah!”</p>
          <p>Black King also bared his fangs and roared back.</p>
          <p>“Grrr!”</p>
          <p>
            The fierce beasts faced each other, assessing their opponent. In an
            instant, the Turtle Lion bared its sharp fangs and leapt forward,
            simultaneously swiping at Tassid with its forepaw. Tassid parried
            the attack with his zhanmadao.
          </p>
          <p>Clang!</p>
          <p>
            The sound of metal echoed as Tassid effortlessly blocked the Turtle
            Lion’s attack. His thick arm muscles bulged as if they would burst,
            but he didn’t give an inch. Both Tassid and Black King effortlessly
            withstood the full weight of the massive Turtle Lion’s strike.
          </p>
          <p>“Grrraaah!”</p>
          <p>
            The enraged Turtle Lion repeatedly swung its forepaws. Tassid
            continued to parry with Dakar, his eyes suddenly blazing with
            determination.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a thunderous shout, Tassid’s rough zhanmadao traced a delicate
            arc, slashing the Turtle Lion’s neck and shoulder simultaneously. A
            brilliant three-strike combination wove a pattern of blood in the
            air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blood spurted as the giant monster lost its life and slowly began to
            sink. Two other Orc warriors, who had been standing by with swords
            and axes for backup, ran over with bright expressions.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, as expected of the brave Tassid!”</p>
          <p>“With this, we won’t go hungry for a while!”</p>
          <p>
            The Orc warriors joyfully began to dismantle the fallen Turtle Lion.
            Their hands, removing the shell and skinning it, moved with
            remarkable skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, for the Orcs living here, a monster attacking their sheep
            was not a disaster but a blessing. Since mere herding was not enough
            to sustain them, they would face food shortages if monsters did not
            attack from time to time. It could even be said that this was their
            staple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, many Orcs died during these attacks, but for those who
            revered warriors, there were no tears to shed for the defeated.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a Turtle Lion of this size, just the meat alone was enough to
            feed them for a while. Moreover, its shell and hide were useful in
            many ways. Tassid and the other Orc warriors enthusiastically
            continued their dismantling work.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they were busy draining the blood and skinning it, the Black King
            quietly approached and tapped the Turtle Lion’s hind leg with his
            paw. Then he looked at Tassid and tapped the thigh this time.
          </p>
          <p>“…What is it?”</p>

          <p>
            At Tassid’s gruff voice, the Black King pointed his nose at the hind
            leg. Through their soul connection, Tassid could immediately sense
            the Direwolf’s will. The Black King was saying this:
          </p>
          <p>“Hurry up and give me my share already.”</p>
          <p>“…Here you go.”</p>
          <p>
            With a wry smile, Tassid sliced off a large chunk of the hind leg
            and tossed it to him. The Black King happily grabbed it with his
            mouth. Then, he tapped Tassid’s shoulder. Anyone could see it was a
            gesture meaning, “Well done, you’ve worked hard.”
          </p>
          <p>“You little rascal…”</p>
          <p>
            Watching the Black King gnawing on the bone from a distance, Tassid
            shook his head. He wondered if the so-called king of the plains was
            more of a ruler by political prowess rather than strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once they were ready to leave, Tassid hoisted the load onto his
            shoulder and whistled.
          </p>
          <p>“Wheeeet!”</p>
          <p>
            The sheep and goats began to gather at the sound. Looking back at
            his companions, Tassid stood up.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, let’s head back to the village.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Endlessly stretching across the plains, there stood a massive rock
            mountain resembling a crouching bear atop a slightly elevated hill.
            A small spring bubbled below the rock mountain, and around it,
            hundreds of leather tents were lined up. This was the spring
            campsite of the true rulers of this harsh land, the Blue Bear Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Tassid and the other two orc men descended the hill carrying the
            Turtle Lion, the orcs who had remained in the village greeted them
            with cheers. Waving back in response to their warm welcome, Tassid
            entered the village. When they arrived in front of a large tent
            nearly twice the size of the others, the curtain was drawn back to
            reveal an orc woman with dark red skin, solid muscles, and ample
            breasts. Despite being a massive figure herself, she commanded an
            imposing presence that could rightly be called that of a formidable
            woman, matching even the brawny Tassid.
          </p>
          <p>Tassid gestured to the Turtle Lion’s carcass and spoke.</p>
          <p>“Today’s harvest, Grandmother.”</p>
          <p>“The children will not go hungry.”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla, the orc woman, nodded in satisfaction. She then picked up a
            piece of the Turtle Lion’s flesh and easily tore it apart with both
            hands. It wasn’t cooked; she had simply ripped the raw meat apart
            with her bare strength. Her strength was so immense that she could
            probably dismember a few people with ease. Yet, the other orcs
            showed no surprise, as if this was a common occurrence.
          </p>
          <p>Holding the torn pieces of meat, Stalla bestowed a blessing.</p>
          <p>
            “Let this flesh and blood become our flesh and blood. Take it and
            fight against destiny!”
          </p>
          <p>
            After the blessing, other female orcs came forward with knives, each
            cutting off their share of the meat. True to being orc women, their
            bodies were all well-built with solid muscles. While they clearly
            had feminine features unlike male orcs, none had the soft, slender
            physiques of human or elf women. For orcs, the standard of obesity
            was determined by how much flab one had, so no matter how skinny one
            was, without muscles, she was just a ‘fat’ woman.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this sense, the forty-year-old Stalla was indeed a fearsome
            beauty. Her skin was practically synonymous with the word ‘muscle’!
            She was a knockout that made all the orc men drool with desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite her rock-hard muscles, Stalla also had a generous bosom.
            With those ample breasts, she had nursed over thirty young orcs,
            earning her the title of mother among mothers. Though this might
            seem odd, she was a woman worthy of respect by orc standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            As she watched the tribe’s orcs carry away the Turtle Lion’s flesh,
            Stalla smiled contentedly. She then looked at Tassid, who was
            standing proudly by her side, and praised him once more.
          </p>
          <p>“Well done, Tassid.”</p>
          <p>“It was nothing,” he replied.</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 107 ]</p>
          <p>
            The young orc with green skin did not originally belong to her
            tribe. Four years ago, he appeared as an outsider through the Land
            of Trials. He had been living as a slave to humans and was brought
            here under the guidance of a mysterious human.
          </p>
          <p>Stalla spoke with a wistful expression.</p>
          <p>“Now, no one denies your worth.”</p>
          <p>
            Back then, there had been much opposition to accepting an outsider
            orc, who had lost both the orc’s soul and pride, into the tribe. It
            was Stalla who had accepted the young Tassid despite all the
            objections. Wise beyond her years, she recognized the potential in
            Tassid, who had broken the chains of fate and awakened the spirit of
            a warrior through his own will.
          </p>
          <p>
            – Learning and mastering the pride of a warrior in one’s soul is
            indeed commendable. Moreover, this child possesses a soul filled
            with pride without having learned or mastered anything. If this
            child is not a warrior, then who else can claim to be one?
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s words had awakened the entire Blue Bear Tribe, and
            everyone, feeling ashamed, accepted the young orc boy. Now, four
            years later, the once frail young orc had become an indispensable
            warrior for the Blue Bear Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>“I am glad to see the fruits of my teaching.”</p>
          <p>At Stalla’s gentle words, Tassid shrugged his shoulders.</p>
          <p>“I am naturally talented, after all.”</p>
          <p>Whack!</p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s backhanded knuckles struck Tassid squarely in the face.
          </p>
          <p>“Stop showing off.”</p>
          <p>“Ouch~.”</p>
          <p>Tassid grabbed his face, pretending to be in pain.</p>
          <p>
            Of course, it didn’t really hurt. If he had been a proud human, this
            blow might have easily broken his nose, but for orcs with flat
            noses, such a facial strike was merely playful banter. It was
            similar to how humans lightly tapped each other on the shoulder.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans might see these orcs as violent and barbaric, but it was
            simply a misunderstanding born from differences in physical
            structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Stalla and Tassid were playfully teasing each other, they saw
            an orc warrior running urgently from the hill in the distance. The
            orc, descending the hill in a single bound like a mountain goat,
            reached Stalla and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Great Mother!”</p>
          <p>“What is the commotion, Magadan?”</p>
          <p>
            The orc called Magadan, with a face full of tension, opened his
            mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Humans have appeared. Angat, who was herding sheep in the west,
            reported it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Tassid and Stalla’s expressions hardened. The other orcs, who had
            been idly tending to the fire, also sharpened their eyes and rose
            from their places.
          </p>

          <p>“Are they soldiers?”</p>
          <p>Magadan shook his head.</p>
          <p>“I heard there are only five of them.”</p>
          <p>“Just a group of adventurers then?”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla frowned. Occasionally, adventurers who had heard strange
            rumors would enter this land of trials. They weren’t after the orcs
            but were instead explorers seeking the ruins of the Silver Age
            located here. Even so, to them, orcs were just wild monsters. Every
            encounter inevitably led to a battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Stalla bared her teeth in a grin, her voice dripping with
            malice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In that case, we should let them know who the true rulers of this
            land are!”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            A week had passed since Repenhardt and his party had headed south
            along the Gloten Mountains. They had now crossed the Fetland Plain
            and entered the land of trials.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under normal circumstances, it would have taken them at least twenty
            days. If they had been traveling on foot, that is. But money makes
            the world go round. With their pockets well-lined, Repenhardt and
            his party had splurged this time, buying horses and riding swiftly.
            With enough money, they could afford the luxury of changing their
            tired horses at every station along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon entering the land of trials, Repenhardt’s party reduced their
            speed. There were no more places to exchange their exhausted horses,
            so they had to be mindful of their mounts’ stamina.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s truly a desolate place, hyung.”</p>
          <p>
            Riding on a horse at a brisk pace, Russ surveyed the surroundings.
            The further they got from the Fetland Plain, the fewer signs of
            human presence there were. The cone-shaped tents of the nomads who
            roamed the plains had long since vanished.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt, leading the way, nodded.</p>
          <p>“It’s no wonder orcs have such a fearsome reputation.”</p>
          <p>
            Orcs were considered rough, brutal, and barbaric. This was the
            common perception among humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this was merely a reflection of the harsh environment the orcs
            lived in. The brutal practice of abandoning weak newborns in the
            wilderness was indeed a part of orc culture. Also true to some
            extent was the practice of elderly orcs leaving their villages to
            die of starvation in the wild.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In reality, orcs see leaving the village as an honorable act, not
            something they’re forced into.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt conveniently omitted the part where orcs who lacked honor
            were indeed driven out of their villages. In the end, being cast out
            was the same either way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, what seemed like barbaric customs were actually the
            most practical survival strategies born out of a relentless struggle
            for life. Hearing Repenhardt’s explanation, Tilla tilted her head.
          </p>
          <p>“…But doesn’t that still make them barbaric?”</p>
          <p>
            “Honestly, why do dwarves get to live in their paradise, building
            all those structures? In the end, living in the wilderness is just
            as tough for them. From her perspective, orcs still seemed like
            barbaric brutes.
          </p>
          <p>Then Siris pouted.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, that’s because the dwarves got lucky and managed to salvage a
            lot of stuff.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite living as slaves to humans, dwarves retained much of their
            ancestral wisdom, allowing them to maintain a somewhat cultured life
            even when exiled to the wilderness. However, from the elves’
            perspective, who had to flee after losing everything, Tilla’s words
            sounded like the complaints of someone who didn’t understand true
            hardship.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But still, how can you say they’re not barbaric when they don’t
            cherish their children or even abandon their elders? Elves don’t do
            that, right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even so, you have to understand their perspective. Do you think
            dwarves could’ve modified the Grand Forge if they had lost all their
            architectural and forging skills?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The two women bickered from their horses. Watching this rare sight
            of an elf defending orcs, Repenhardt held his forehead in his hand.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, this is a problem, too. Come to think of it.’</p>
          <p>
            Though it was just a trivial argument between Tilla and Siris,
            Repenhardt understood the implications of what he was seeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how oppressed the different races were, the idea that they
            would band together in perfect unity was a naive expectation. In his
            past life, elves, dwarves, and orcs constantly had various
            conflicts. Different races with different cultures couldn’t easily
            blend together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jealousy and rivalry weren’t unique to humans. Even the most
            rational elves, the truth-seeking dwarves, and the proud orcs had
            different standards for rationality, truth, and pride. Ultimately,
            putting different races together led to problems, whether they were
            humans, elves, dwarves, or orcs.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Well, back then, I could enforce unity with the Emperor’s power,
            but now that’s not an option…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his cheek in frustration. He thought he’d need
            to discuss this issue with Makelin later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Siris and Tilla had finally ended their argument and were
            riding their horses again, both with puffed cheeks and sulky
            expressions. Repenhardt continued walking, pretending not to notice.
            From his long years of experience, he had learned that no man ever
            came out of a women’s quarrel unscathed.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed Sillan understood this ‘wisdom’ well too. He approached
            Repenhardt and started talking about something else, smoothly
            changing the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But Mr. Repen, how are you going to persuade the orcs? Ah, of
            course, I’m sure you have a way, but I’m just curious.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a belief that since Repenhardt had easily persuaded the
            elves and dwarves, he would naturally do the same with the orcs.
            Surprisingly, Repenhardt made a troubled expression.
          </p>
          <p>“I do have a method, but I’m not very confident about it.”</p>
          <p>In fact, Repenhardt was indeed worried.</p>
          <p>
            The dwarves posed no problem since they could hear the voice of
            truth. The elves, being rational thinkers and having the hidden card
            of the World Tree revival ritual, were also not a concern. However,
            he had only thought about how to communicate to the orcs that he was
            not an enemy and was on their side; he wasn’t certain it would work.
          </p>
          <p>“I guess I’ll have to confront this head-on to find out.”</p>
          <p>
            At that, Siris rode up to Repenhardt’s side. She whispered so that
            the others couldn’t hear.
          </p>
          <p>“Won’t you just do it the same way you did in your past life?”</p>
          <p>
            She implied that since he had persuaded them once, it shouldn’t be a
            problem. Repenhardt, feeling awkward, whispered back to her.
          </p>
          <p>“Well… back then, I had Tassid.”</p>
          <p>
            In his past life, Repenhardt met Tassid while exploring various
            ruins across the continent with Siris. During that time, Repenhardt
            was already meeting with different races across the continent,
            delving into new realms of magic, and rescuing oppressed elves and
            orcs whenever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before the Antares Empire was established, Tassid had left the Blue
            Bear Tribe to wander the continent, seeking to save oppressed orcs.
            It was during a period of deep despair when he realized that he
            couldn’t change anything alone in a world dominated by humans.
          </p>

          <p>
            To Tassid, Repenhardt’s existence was a beacon of hope. After
            finding Repenhardt and testing him with his sword, Tassid realized
            that Repenhardt was the only way to fulfill his dream. He then
            pledged his loyalty to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those were the golden days for Repenhardt—exploring Silver Age ruins
            with Siris and Tassid, visiting isolated tribes, and rescuing
            enslaved races across the continent. It was a time filled with
            dreams, hope, and freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, Repenhardt united the various tribal villages into what
            became the Antares Empire and headed to the Blue Bear Tribe with
            Tassid. By then, the fame of the Antares Empire had spread across
            the continent. The Blue Bear Tribe joined their cause without much
            resistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, without Tassid as an intermediary and nothing significant
            accomplished yet, how could he possibly convey to the orcs that his
            dreams and intentions were genuine?
          </p>
          <p>Naturally, his confidence was wavering.</p>
          <p>Repenhardt clicked his tongue and muttered.</p>
          <p>
            “Still, it’s not like I have no plan at all. We’ll just have to meet
            them first.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just then, Russ frowned and placed his hand on the hilt of his
            sword. He called out to the group in a low voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Something’s coming.”</p>
          <p>
            The group halted and dismounted. Over the distant hill, a group of
            armed individuals appeared. Around twenty sturdy orcs with dark red
            skin, clad in leather armor and wielding crude swords and axes.
          </p>
          <p>Looking at their attire, Repenhardt spoke.</p>
          <p>“Orc scouts.”</p>
          <p>“Must be the companions of the ones who scouted us earlier.”</p>
          <p>
            With the keen senses of an aura user, Russ had already noticed that
            an orc had been observing them. Repenhardt nodded.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It looks like they’re going to attack. Try not to harm them too
            much. We’re here with peaceful intentions.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The orcs drew their weapons and began to close the distance slowly.
            Repenhardt’s party formed a circle around the horses. Tilla and
            Siris protected Sillan, drawing their weapons, while Sillan began
            chanting a holy spell in preparation.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, the lead orc let out a roar.</p>
          <p>“Judika kadel metalka! Sakan da talka!”</p>
          <p>Sillan asked nervously.</p>
          <p>“What are they saying?”</p>
          <p>“This is our land. All humans will die.”</p>
          <p>Tilla shook her head at Repenhardt’s translation.</p>
          <p>“How hostile.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt took a step forward and raised his voice.</p>
          <p>“Spirits of the Blue Warriors! I am here to…”</p>
          <p>
            Just as he was about to declare in orcish that they were not
            enemies, the twenty orcs roared in unison.
          </p>
          <p>“Sakan da talka!”</p>
          <p>
            And with terrifying momentum, they charged towards the group. Russ
            smirked bitterly.
          </p>
          <p>“Looks like they’re not in the mood for talking.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 108 ]</p>
          <p>“Graaaa!”</p>
          <p>
            With a beast-like roar, the crude sword of an orc slashed through
            the air. Siris deftly dodged the sword and struck the orc’s thigh.
            Since she intentionally struck with the flat side of the blade, no
            blood splattered. Nonetheless, a scream escaped from the orc’s
            mouth.
          </p>
          <p>“Ughhh!”</p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, another orc launched a series of attacks. Siris
            easily maneuvered her body, slipping through the attacks. Then, she
            delivered consecutive kicks, striking the back of the orcs’ heads.
          </p>
          <p>“Thud!”</p>
          <p>
            Two orcs stumbled as they were hit in the back of their heads. Tilla
            swiftly swept their legs with the handle of her axe. The orcs fell
            with a groan.
          </p>
          <p>“Grrrr!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ, too, was moving among the orcs, wielding his sword. He didn’t
            even use aura. He simply fought the orcs with his sheathed sword,
            knocking them down one by one.
          </p>
          <p>Whack! Whack! Whack! Whack!</p>
          <p>Even Repenhardt didn’t bother to dodge.</p>
          <p>“Takara!”</p>
          <p>“Kratta!”</p>
          <p>
            With tenacity-filled shouts, the orcs’ iron hammers and stone axes
            simultaneously struck Repenhardt’s chest and back. Repenhardt spread
            his arms wide with a grin. The orcs’ mouths dropped open at the
            sensation of hitting solid steel. No matter how fiercely determined
            they were, they couldn’t hide their astonishment at this sight.
            After all, seeing someone deflect blades with their bare body wasn’t
            something one witnessed every day.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Repenhardt’s group easily overpowered more than twenty orcs.
            Needless to say, Repenhardt and Russ were aura users, while Siris
            and Tilla were also among the top warriors of their clan. On top of
            that, they were blessed by the powerful priest, Sillan, so it was no
            surprise that the orcs stood no chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, despite the situation, Repenhardt’s group was impressed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Quite impressive, these orcs,” Russ remarked, deflecting the orcs’
            attacks with his sheathed sword. For the orcs facing him, it was
            infuriating, but in truth, he was genuinely impressed by the skill
            of these orc warriors. They seemed capable enough to be compared to
            the knights of the Tenes Order he once belonged to. It was just that
            their party’s skill level was too high; otherwise, these orcs alone
            would be formidable opponents for any knightly order.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt nodded in agreement.</p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, they are impressive. The problem is, orcs have a critical
            weakness…”
          </p>
          <p>At that moment, the orcs let out a collective roar of rage.</p>
          <p>“Grrrr!”</p>
          <p>“Graaaa!”</p>
          <p>
            For a long time, they charged in without managing to inflict a
            single wound, and their emotions exploded in humiliation. Normally,
            they would have sensed the difference in capability and retreated,
            but instead, they began to swing their swords recklessly,
            disregarding their own lives. To orcs who revered warriors, a battle
            where their opponent held back was utterly disgraceful. Their eyes
            gleamed with a murderous glint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Facing those who disregarded their own lives was challenging
            regardless of their skill level. Especially considering that they
            couldn’t afford to injure them, it made things even more difficult.
            Siris and Tilla’s movements faltered for a moment. At that moment,
            Repenhardt, enduring the blades with his entire body, raised his
            arms.
          </p>

          <p>“Sand, flow. Become the dream of the abyss! Mass Sleep!”</p>
          <p>
            As he scattered sand with both hands, the powder spread out,
            enveloping the orcs. In an instant, Russ wore a bewildered
            expression.
          </p>
          <p>“Eh?”</p>
          <p>
            The twenty or so orcs, who had been so ferocious, collapsed all at
            once. They fell with a thud, immediately lying down and beginning to
            breathe shallowly. It was the effect of Repenhardt’s 2nd-circle
            wide-area sleep spell, Mass Sleep.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan murmured in disbelief.</p>
          <p>“No way, why is it so effective?”</p>
          <p>
            Originally, sleep spells weren’t meant to be used this way. They
            were supposed to be used subtly, making the target drowsy without
            them realizing it. To use it in the midst of battle and for it to
            work? It was almost suspicious, as if it were a high-level paralysis
            spell rather than a 2nd-circle spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wasn’t sleep supposed to be completely useless in actual combat?”
          </p>
          <p>At Sillan’s question, Repenhardt made a bitter expression.</p>
          <p>
            “This is why orcs, despite their formidable combat prowess, are
            still outmatched by humans.”
          </p>
          <p>That’s right. Orcs severely lacked magic resistance.</p>
          <p>
            Humans, if they had strong enough mental fortitude, could resist a
            mage’s mental spells through concentration. But orcs were inherently
            very weak in this aspect. Even the mightiest warriors could be toyed
            with by the mental magic of a low-level mage.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In the old days, there were so few mages that it wasn’t a problem
            for the orcs…”
          </p>
          <p>
            In the past, the very existence of magic was extremely rare. Only a
            very few mages secretly passed down their arcane knowledge. But now,
            with the establishment of the Magic Tower and formal training of
            mages, mages were no longer as rare. They were still valuable, but
            at least now, most noble families of count rank or higher could
            afford to have one or two mages in their household.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over hundreds of years, humans gradually increased their magical
            power. The orcs, who lived scattered in tribal units, were gradually
            defeated by humans who had established magic battalions, weakening
            their power. In the present era, most orcs have become slaves.
          </p>
          <p>At Repenhardt’s explanation, Sillan tilted his head.</p>
          <p>
            “Then, no matter how strong a warrior they are, aren’t they pretty
            much useless?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt shook his head.</p>
          <p>
            “Sillan, think about if you cast a simple mental defense blessing on
            them.”
          </p>
          <p>Sillan’s expression turned curious.</p>
          <p>“Well, indeed…”</p>
          <p>
            Mental protection spells were not particularly difficult. Sillan
            could even create protective talismans that could last for a long
            time. The orcs’ weakness was certainly serious, but it was a problem
            of the orcs themselves. It could be easily overcome with a little
            help from other races.
          </p>
          <p>“Moreover, these guys aren’t even warriors.”</p>
          <p>
            At Repenhardt’s continued words, everyone looked surprised. These
            orcs, with such excellent skills, weren’t warriors?
          </p>

          <p>
            “The true warriors of the Blue Bear Tribe guard the village, herd
            sheep and goats, protect food supplies, and hunt invading monsters.
            Only the orcs who haven’t become warriors yet wander the wilderness,
            patrolling and honing their skills to earn the title of warrior.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed contrary to human common sense, but considering their
            lifestyle, it made sense. Russ shook his head in disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>“This level of skill… doesn’t even qualify as a warrior?”</p>
          <p>
            In any case, since the situation was resolved, Repenhardt’s party
            gathered their horses again. They decided to leave the sleeping orcs
            as they were. After all, these orcs usually wandered the wilderness
            and slept anywhere. Sleeping for an hour or two in such a place
            wouldn’t cause them any harm.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s a sleep spell, not a paralysis spell. If any monsters appear,
            they’ll wake up soon. They’re all trained for that.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s group carefully moved away from the area so as not to
            wake the sleeping orcs. Once they were far enough that the sleeping
            orcs were no longer visible, they mounted their horses again.
            Repenhardt looked eastward.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If we go straight this way, we’ll reach the Blue Bear Tribe’s
            campsite. They should be there around this time.”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s party couldn’t reach the Blue Bear Tribe’s spring camp.
            Before they got there, a group of orcs came out to greet them.
          </p>
          <p>“Awooooo!”</p>
          <p>
            The howls of the direwolves carrying the orcs echoed across the
            plains. The air was thick with tension. The horses, terrified,
            stamped their hooves. Calming their mounts, Repenhardt’s party
            quickly dismounted.
          </p>
          <p>
            With grim expressions, they faced the orcs before them. Russ
            unconsciously grasped his sword hilt and let out a groan.
          </p>
          <p>“My God…”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing them made it clear why the previous orcs were not considered
            warriors. Just standing there, these orcs emanated an aura on a
            completely different level. There were only about a dozen, but each
            one exuded the presence of a powerful warrior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among them, one huge orc slowly stepped forward. His entire body was
            wrapped in a gray cloak, and a hood covered his head, revealing only
            his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>The orc opened his mouth and shouted loudly.</p>
          <p>“This is our land! Humans cannot enter!”</p>
          <p>
            It was surprisingly clear in the common tongue. Despite the charisma
            in his voice that made them shudder, Russ felt a sense of curiosity.
            The tone of the voice seemed somewhat thin.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt took a step forward and raised both hands.</p>
          <p>“Oh noble spirits of warriors!”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs, who had been exuding murderous intent, suddenly showed
            signs of confusion. Hearing their own language from the intruder’s
            mouth, their fierce demeanor softened. They began to murmur among
            themselves, exchanging glances.
          </p>
          <p>Seeing this, Repenhardt smiled inwardly.</p>
          <p>‘As expected…’</p>
          <p>
            Indeed, when dealing with different races, knowing their language
            was immensely valuable. Just being able to speak their language
            could halve the hostility. Repenhardt hadn’t learned the languages
            of different races so diligently in his past life for nothing. Of
            course, in his past life, he was such a genius that he could speak a
            language fluently after staying in a place for about three months
            without much effort.
          </p>

          <p>Repenhardt continued in Orcish.</p>
          <p>“We have come here to establish friendship with you!”</p>
          <p>“…Friendship?”</p>
          <p>
            The huge orc woman, Stalla, was taken aback. In her life, the
            relationship between orcs and humans had always been simple and
            straightforward.
          </p>
          <p>
            When humans appeared, they fought. They either killed or were
            killed. That was all.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea of a human extending a hand in friendship was something she
            had never imagined. For a moment, she couldn’t make sense of the
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>She shouted back in the common tongue.</p>
          <p>“Humans are deceitful! I don’t trust you!”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt responded in Orcish.</p>
          <p>“I understand! That’s why we want to show you our trust!”</p>
          <p>‘He understands?’</p>
          <p>
            Stalla looked at the intruder in front of her with a face that
            showed she couldn’t comprehend. There was no hostility in his voice
            or demeanor. The human seemed to be speaking sincerely. Of course,
            humans were cunning, so she couldn’t trust him just like that…
          </p>
          <p>“What are you scheming, human! You are…”</p>
          <p>
            She began to shout in the common tongue, then suddenly laughed. It
            was funny when she thought about it. The human was speaking fluently
            in Orcish, while she, an orc, was replying in the human language.
          </p>
          <p>Mid-sentence, Stalla switched to Orcish.</p>
          <p>“You say you came here to meet us?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt replied calmly, looking directly at Stalla. Seeing the
            clear absence of hostility in her eyes, he felt pleased.
          </p>
          <p>‘It seems we’ve managed to start a conversation.’</p>
          <p>
            Normally, these orcs of the wilderness wouldn’t bother talking to
            humans. They would usually draw their swords at first sight, like
            the orc scouts they had met earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that these were among the top warriors of the orcs actually
            worked in their favor. True warriors, confident in their own
            strength, had enough composure to be taken aback by a human speaking
            Orcish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, it was only that they had started a conversation. The
            orcs were still wary of Repenhardt’s party. They were ready to draw
            their weapons at the slightest sign of trouble. Repenhardt
            cautiously stepped forward and continued.
          </p>
          <p>“Noble warrior, would you give us a chance to prove our trust?”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s eyes wavered. No matter how much orcs hated humans, they
            were fundamentally a straightforward and bold race. With the human
            approaching like this, it was difficult to respond with immediate
            hostility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Above all, wasn’t this human speaking the blessed language? It
            wasn’t the warrior’s way to reject someone who spoke their language
            so fluently and respectfully without reason.
          </p>
          <p>Stalla’s tone softened.</p>
          <p>“Tell me, how do you intend to prove yourselves?”</p>
          <p>
            She was also curious. How could these humans prove their trust to
            her, an orc?
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt smiled broadly and spoke.</p>
          <p>
            “A true warrior shines their soul through their blade. To prove our
            sincerity, I propose a ritual of honorable combat.”

          <p>[ Chapter 109 ]</p>
          <p>The Ritual of Hotu.</p>
          <p>
            This was originally a ceremony commonly held when orc tribes
            interacted with each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            The orcs, who revered strength, believed they could understand each
            other by competing in skill. By clashing weapons imbued with each
            other’s souls, they believed their souls communicated, thus truly
            connecting with their opponent. Therefore, when orc tribes
            interacted, the warriors of each tribe would exchange swords to
            measure the trustworthiness of their opponents.
          </p>
          <p>A vile person can never be strong!</p>
          <p>Therefore, a strong person can be trusted!</p>
          <p>
            This was the orcs’ belief. To humans, this might seem like a
            simple-minded way of thinking, but at least the orcs believed in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘The problem is… whether they will acknowledge the Ritual of Hotu
            against humans…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Feeling nervous inside, Repenhardt looked at the orcs. The Ritual of
            Hotu was an orc tradition, and he wasn’t sure if they would
            acknowledge it in interactions with different races…
          </p>
          <p>“The Ritual of Hotu!”</p>
          <p>“A human knows of our great tradition!”</p>
          <p>“Grandmother! Let’s accept it!”</p>
          <p>
            As expected, they were orcs. They weren’t a race that thought too
            deeply. At Repenhardt’s suggestion, their expressions changed, and
            the hostility vanished, replaced by eyes shining with interest.
          </p>
          <p>“A human knows boldness!”</p>
          <p>“Indeed! True conversation can only occur when blades clash!”</p>
          <p>
            …The atmosphere was more excited than expected. Just the fact that
            their opponent knew of their tradition significantly increased their
            favorability. Orcs were indeed simple-minded. Tilla and Siris
            clicked their tongues.
          </p>
          <p>“…So simple!”</p>
          <p>“As expected of orcs.”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Stalla raised her right hand. The murmuring among
            the orcs instantly ceased. She began scrutinizing Repenhardt with
            serious eyes. Repenhardt swallowed nervously. No matter how
            favorable the orcs’ response was, it would mean nothing if the orc
            in front of him did not give her permission.
          </p>
          <p>Stalla spoke.</p>
          <p>“A human knows of our great tradition.”</p>
          <p>“It was a fortunate encounter.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite his inner anxiety, Repenhardt replied calmly. Suddenly,
            Stalla smirked.
          </p>
          <p>“May I ask your name?”</p>
          <p>“Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>Stalla stroked her chin and continued in a low voice.</p>
          <p>
            “Repenhardt, while others may not know, I am aware. Humans, unlike
            us, betray the song of the sword. A human can even betray a sword
            imbued with their own soul.”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s expression hardened slightly.</p>
          <p>‘Damn it, did I fail?’</p>
          <p>At that moment, Stalla’s gentle voice followed.</p>
          <p>
            “But you know the language of blessings, and you understand our
            traditions. I think it is meaningful to share swords with someone
            like you.”
          </p>

          <p>
            In an instant, Repenhardt’s expression brightened. Stalla concluded
            with a solemn voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Proving your strength alone will not earn trust. The resonance of
            your soul through the sword will determine your fate. Will you do
            it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt nodded confidently. At his resolute gaze, Stalla raised
            her hand high and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Stalla of the Blue Bear Tribe! I accept the Ritual of Hotu!”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            “……So, it has come to this. Everyone will have to fight. Sorry I
            didn’t tell you earlier.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After explaining the Ritual of Hotu, Repenhardt scratched his head
            as he looked at his companions. It wasn’t that he had hidden it on
            purpose; he hadn’t expected to encounter the orcs so soon and hadn’t
            had the chance to explain the plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ nodded at the explanation but then showed a puzzled expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of course, hyung and I will fight, but… do Siris and Tilla have to
            fight too? They’re not humans, and especially since they’re women…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “To the orcs, we’re all just outsiders. Even if we were orcs, we’d
            still have to fight. Their way of thinking is different from humans.
            Besides, orcs don’t distinguish between men and women in battle.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Ritual of Hotu is about proving one’s worth through combat. As
            long as Siris, an elf, and Tilla, a dwarf, claim to be warriors,
            they cannot be exceptions. To be treated as equals by the orcs, they
            must participate in the ritual.
          </p>
          <p>Tilla gripped her axe, her eyes gleaming.</p>
          <p>
            “I am also a warrior representing the Steelhammer clan. I welcome a
            duel.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris silently nodded, running her fingers along the blade of her
            scimitar, indicating her consent.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, Sillan’s face was filled with fear.</p>
          <p>“Do I have to fight too?”</p>
          <p>
            Though a veteran at supporting from the rear, Sillan would likely
            get beaten by any passing civilian in a one-on-one fight. Naturally,
            Repenhardt had no intention of sending Sillan into battle.
          </p>
          <p>“You don’t have to fight.”</p>
          <p>“But then I won’t be properly treated, right?”</p>
          <p>“You’re not a warrior. This is strictly for warriors.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt averted his eyes as he saw Sillan’s relieved expression.
            In truth, Sillan was exempt because he was still a child, but
            Repenhardt left that part out. Even the most brutish orcs wouldn’t
            consider a child—a least in appearance—as a participant in the
            ritual.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, even after the ritual, Sillan would still be treated like
            a child…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘He’s already being treated like a kid, isn’t he? He probably won’t
            even notice. Maybe.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Feeling a slight pang of guilt, Repenhardt chose to ignore it. After
            organizing the order, he shouted towards the orcs.
          </p>
          <p>“We are ready!”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs spread out and created a wide space. After making a large
            clearing in the center, the orcs began stomping and shouting. Amidst
            the earth-shaking noise, Stalla declared.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Outsiders, we will begin the Ritual of Hotu! Those who wish to
            prove their worth, step forward!”
          </p>
          <p>
            As planned, Siris slowly walked to the center of the clearing.
            Stalla looked Siris up and down and then shouted to her tribe.
          </p>
          <p>“Jalkato! Take up the Ritual of Hotu!”</p>
          <p>
            A sturdy orc warrior, holding two swords, darted forward and
            shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“An honor, Matron!”</p>
          <p>
            With his eyes gleaming, the orc warrior called Jalkato surrounded
            himself with an aura of energy. Displaying a momentum that surpassed
            that of most orc gladiators, Jalkato crossed his swords in the air
            and shouted.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I am Jalkato, son of Derata, inheritor of my father’s sword! I will
            face you!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris stared blankly at Jalkato. He seemed to be growling something
            in Orcish, which she couldn’t understand. Realizing this, Jalkato
            switched to a different language.
          </p>
          <p>“I, Jalkato! Fight you!”</p>
          <p>
            Though not fluent, the common language was understandable. Sillan
            muttered in surprise.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, that orc knows the common language too…”</p>
          <p>
            It was a muttered remark, but Stalla, from afar, caught it and
            smiled sadly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “World belongs to humans now. Orcs must know the common language.
            All warriors know it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a sad reflection of a fallen race, but Sillan took it
            differently.
          </p>
          <p>“Gasp! So all orc warriors can speak the common language?”</p>
          <p>
            These brutish-looking orcs were actually bilingual intellectuals!
            Realizing this, Sillan glanced at Russ with a sudden understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mr. Russ, do you know any languages other than the common one?”
          </p>
          <p>“Uh, no? Just the common language is enough for daily life…”</p>
          <p>“Could it be that we are the least educated ones?”</p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the two human men sinking into self-doubt, the ritual
            continued. Looking at Jalkato, Siris also raised her scimitar and
            introduced herself.
          </p>
          <p>“I am Siris Valencia of the Dahnhaim Tribe.”</p>
          <p>
            She didn’t use her family name, Serendi El Areliana, but instead the
            name she received from Repenhardt. It seemed trivial, but it was her
            own way of reciprocating her feelings towards Repenhardt. Of course,
            Repenhardt didn’t notice at all. Expecting a man to pick up on such
            subtlety was excessively harsh.
          </p>
          <p>‘Tsk…….’</p>
          <p>
            Slightly peeved, she quickly composed herself and began to focus on
            the opponent in front of her. Siris, with her sword pointed, and the
            orc warrior Jalkato, with his dual swords extended, glared at each
            other, their fighting spirits ablaze.
          </p>
          <p>In a split second.</p>
          <p>The two warriors charged at each other.</p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>“Kraaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            With two shouts of battle cry, Siris’s scimitar and the two Orcish
            swords clashed. The blades scraped against each other, sparking
            repeatedly.
          </p>
          <p>Crackle!</p>
          <p>
            Amidst the piercing sound of clashing metal, Siris and Jalkato,
            still locked in combat, both showed astonished expressions. Pushing
            their blades against each other, Jalkato murmured with a puzzled
            look.
          </p>
          <p>“How does a body so frail have such strength?”</p>
          <p>
            Amazingly, Siris wasn’t being pushed back at all, even while
            engaging in a direct power struggle with the orc warrior Jalkato.
            Considering that Siris’s waist was even thinner than Jalkato’s
            thigh, it was truly an extraordinary sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, it wasn’t that Siris actually possessed strength equal to
            Jalkato.
          </p>
          <p>‘He certainly has good strength, but still…….’</p>
          <p>Recalling her usual sparring sessions, Siris faintly smiled.</p>

          <p>
            Indeed, while Jalkato possessed the formidable strength typical of
            an orc warrior, unfortunately for him, her usual sparring partners
            were Tilla and Repenhardt. She was more than used to techniques for
            handling powerful swords. No matter how strong the blow, she could
            deflect it using the elasticity of her knees and waist, sequentially
            reducing its power, making it manageable even with her strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            The elf girl and the orc warrior faced each other with their swords
            locked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each time Jalkato tried to overpower her with brute force, Siris
            would slightly twist her scimitar, diverting the point of attack.
            Despite the significant difference in their body weights, with
            Jalkato’s strength far surpassing hers, the force of his attacks was
            misdirected, preventing him from applying his full power
            effectively.
          </p>
          <p>Admiringly, Jalkato leapt back to create distance.</p>
          <p>“Impressive! Elf woman! You are a true warrior!”</p>
          <p>
            As Jalkato retreated, Siris immediately launched an attack. Swinging
            her scimitar repeatedly, she executed diagonal slashes. The silver
            blade targeted Jalkato’s waist and shoulder simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Jalkato was also a seasoned warrior. Although momentarily
            flustered and pushed back, he quickly steadied himself and assumed a
            defensive stance.
          </p>
          <p>Bang! Tatatang!</p>
          <p>
            With composure, Jalkato once again began to deftly wield his twin
            swords.
          </p>
          <p>
            His dual swords moved wildly as if they were living creatures,
            attempting a counterattack. With his left sword, he deflected Siris’
            incoming strike and simultaneously launched a lightning-fast thrust
            with his right sword. As Siris dodged the thrust, the left sword,
            which had been on defense, switched to offense and attacked again.
            The two swords in his hands constantly switched roles between attack
            and defense, making it feel like facing two opponents at once, which
            was incredibly difficult to handle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Exchanging attacks and defenses, Siris inwardly clicked her tongue.
          </p>
          <p>‘This is no joke…’</p>
          <p>
            Even during her time as a slave in Elvenheim, she had often fought
            against human knights and could confidently claim victory. Even the
            renowned golden knight, Sir Eusus, was inferior to her in
            swordsmanship. Moreover, the current Siris had further honed her
            skills through constant sparring with Repenhardt and Russ, both aura
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            At her current level, it was safe to say that there were hardly any
            opponents who could match her unless they were aura users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet here was an ordinary orc warrior displaying skills on par with
            hers without any difficulty. Repenhardt’s words came to mind anew.
          </p>
          <p>
            – As far as I know, they are the strongest combat group on the
            surface. Even including humans, elves, and dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, if all the warriors of the Blue Bear Tribe possessed such
            skills, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to call them the strongest
            combat group on the surface.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as time passed, the tide of the battle began to tilt to one
            side. One of them had a distinct weakness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris swung her scimitar, still exuding a chilling aura, and her
            eyes gleamed.
          </p>
          <p>‘Surely, his swordsmanship has reached a high level, but…’</p>
          <p>
            Jalkato’s dual swords continued to swirl chaotically without losing
            their momentum. However, with her elven precision, Siris clearly
            perceived the state of his swords.
          </p>
          <p>‘Unfortunately, his swords can’t keep up with his skills…’</p>
          <p>
            Due to the countless clashes, Jalkato’s dual swords were already
            chipped and worn out. Unlike Siris’ scimitar, which was meticulously
            crafted by a dwarven master and enchanted with various support
            spells by Repenhardt, Jalkato’s dual swords were nothing more than
            crudely made, cheap weapons.
          </p>
          <p>‘If that’s the case…!’</p>
          <p>
            With a triumphant smile, Siris deflected Jalkato’s offensive.
            Seizing the moment when the two swords briefly veered aside, she
            leapt into the air.
          </p>
          <p>“Hiyah!”</p>
          <p>
            She gripped her scimitar firmly with both hands and raised it above
            her head.
          </p>
          <p>A downward strike with all her body’s momentum!</p>
          <p>
            Though the move was rather large due to the force behind it, Siris
            timed it perfectly, leaving Jalkato no room to evade. In a hurry,
            Jalkato crossed his twin swords above his head to defend.
          </p>
          <p>“Hah!”</p>
          <p>
            And that was precisely her aim. Her target was not Jalkato but his
            twin swords. She intended to destroy his weapons.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaah!”</p>
          <p>
            With all her strength, she brought down a powerful strike onto the
            crossed blades. At that moment, Jalkato bared his teeth and let out
            a strange voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Skevan! Satara!”</p>
          <p>The swords resonated.</p>
          <p>Wooo!</p>
          <p>
            A hazy white light covered the blades of his twin swords. Despite
            being chipped and battered, Jalkato’s beloved swords, Skevan and
            Satara, began to shine and emitted a fearsome sharpness as if they
            had just been reforged.

          <p>[ Chapter 110 ]</p>
          <p>Thud!</p>
          <p>
            The two wailing swords effortlessly handled Siris’s scimitars.
            Surprised by the sensation, as if she had struck an iron wall, Siris
            somersaulted backwards to create some distance.
          </p>
          <p>“What, what is this?”</p>
          <p>
            Gripping the glowing twin swords in his hands, Jalkato shouted
            boldly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s useless! Elf warrior! A weapon is my very soul! The soul of a
            warrior does not break!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris, at a loss for words, stared at Jalkato’s swords. Blades
            emitting a white light?
          </p>
          <p>“Could it be aura?”</p>
          <p>
            But Siris quickly shook her head. While it seemed similar on the
            surface, it was definitely not aura. For one, it wasn’t bright
            enough to be considered blade aura.
          </p>
          <p>At that moment, she heard Repenhardt’s shout from behind her.</p>
          <p>
            “Don’t be alarmed, Siris! It’s the orcs’ secret technique, Spirits
            Weapon!”
          </p>
          <p>All orcs were born warriors.</p>
          <p>
            To such orcs, a weapon was not a mere tool. It was another part of
            themselves, closer even than a blood relative or a spouse, a
            comrade-in-arms connected by soul.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, a true orc warrior could communicate with the soul of their
            weapon. A weapon forged in a warrior’s hands received a part of
            their soul, becoming a great weapon that shone with that soul’s
            brilliance. This belief led to the unique orc technique of Spirits
            Weapon, where they drew out the soul of the weapon to fight
            alongside them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to call forth the soul of the weapon by name and use
            Spirits Weapon was proof of a true warrior among the orcs.
          </p>
          <p>Raising his sword proudly, Jalkato shouted triumphantly.</p>
          <p>“My sword will not break unless you defeat me!”</p>
          <p>
            A shout full of the exuberance of a true warrior, the orcs watching
            the Ritual of Hotu roared in unison.
          </p>
          <p>“Ooooooooh!”</p>
          <p>“Kraaaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Siris scrutinized Jalkato with a frown. Although
            Repenhardt’s advice not to panic was appreciated…
          </p>
          <p>‘So what is it exactly?’</p>
          <p>
            Just telling the name was not helpful. He should have given a more
            practical explanation, right?
          </p>
          <p>Realizing his mistake, Repenhardt quickly added.</p>
          <p>
            “Just think of it as making the sword incredibly tough and sharp!”
          </p>
          <p>
            In truth, a skilled orc warrior could use Spirits Weapon in many
            more ways, but explaining that would require setting up a lecture
            right there.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>And that explanation was enough for Siris.</p>
          <p>
            ‘So it’s a technique unique to the orcs, similar to Tilla’s Earth
            Resonance?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the performance had startled her a bit, upon hearing it, it
            didn’t seem like such a grand technique.
          </p>

          <p>
            ‘It’s just like fighting an opponent wielding a famed sword, isn’t
            it?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering the cost of renowned swords, it was certainly an
            economical technique, but it wasn’t something that would drastically
            change the battle. Compared to the power boost from Tilla’s
            technique, it seemed quite lacking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris, now reassured, calmed her surprise and lunged forward again.
            Her silver scimitar performed a dazzling sword dance.
          </p>
          <p>“Haaap!”</p>
          <p>“Groooar!”</p>
          <p>
            Jalkato, letting out a roar fitting of an orc, reentered the fray.
            In an instant, they were within striking distance. At that moment,
            Siris suddenly lowered her body and launched a sweeping kick.
            Expecting an attack from the sword, Jalkato was caught off guard and
            swung his dual blades low to block the attack.
          </p>
          <p>‘Got you!’</p>
          <p>
            With a gleam in her eyes, Siris retracted her kick. Unlike a sword,
            a kick could be pulled back midway. Narrowly avoiding the dual
            blades, Siris immediately stomped hard on the side of the blade,
            which was now lowered.
          </p>
          <p>“Taat!”</p>
          <p>
            Seizing the opportunity, Siris immobilized Jalkato’s blades and
            launched a slashing attack. Jalkato’s expression hardened. If he
            hesitated over the trapped sword, he would lose his head.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            In the end, Jalkato had no choice but to let go of his swords and
            quickly leap back to evade the attack.
          </p>
          <p>‘I won!’</p>
          <p>
            Siris smiled triumphantly. What clearer sign of defeat was there
            than a warrior letting go of his weapon? It was the moment she was
            sure of her victory.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Jalkato extended his hand and shouted in Orcish.</p>
          <p>“My allies!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, the two swords that had fallen to the ground flew up
            on their own and hurtled towards Siris. Her eyes widened in shock.
          </p>
          <p>‘W-What is this!’</p>
          <p>
            It was beyond her imagination. The swords that had been lying on the
            ground were now floating in the air and striking at her. Startled,
            Siris hurriedly raised her scimitar and deflected the two swords.
          </p>
          <p>Clang! Clang!</p>
          <p>
            Metallic sounds rang out as her scimitar clashed with the dual
            blades, creating a cacophony. Siris forcefully pushed the floating
            swords away. The repelled swords started to drift back towards
            Jalkato.
          </p>
          <p>From behind, Repenhardt’s exclamation followed.</p>
          <p>“Oh, right. Sometimes the swords fly on their own!”</p>
          <p>
            Even the composed Siris couldn’t help but feel infuriated hearing
            this. How could he omit such crucial information?
          </p>
          <p>“Human! You should have said that first!”</p>
          <p>
            Outraged, Siris yelled, then took a deep breath to calm herself.
            Jalkato, now wielding the two floating swords again, expressed his
            admiration.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Truly remarkable, Elf warrior. I didn’t expect to fight alongside
            my weapons.”
          </p>
          <p>Regaining her composure, Siris muttered with a wry smile.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, considering it’s the secret of an entire race, it’s no
            surprise it involves more than just enhancing weapon performance.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Jalkato’s attack continued relentlessly. As she parried repeatedly,
            Siris broke into a cold sweat. His technique of deftly wielding dual
            swords remained the same as before, but interspersed with his
            strikes were moves beyond common sense. In the middle of a swing, he
            would suddenly let go of a sword into the air and attack her left
            side, while the sword floating in midair would fly towards her
            right.
          </p>

          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris was continuously pushed back, her expression troubled. Jalkato
            had been difficult to handle even without these tricks, but now one
            of his swords was moving independently, attacking unpredictably,
            making it impossible for her to gain the upper hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only silver lining was that the floating sword’s movements were
            quite simple. While the sword in Jalkato’s hand struck with precise
            and lethal trajectories, the flying sword moved with the basic
            motions of an amateur. Had it been more complex, the outcome of the
            fight would have already been decided.
          </p>
          <p>Even so, there was no way to overcome the current situation.</p>
          <p>‘Do I have to accept defeat like this?’</p>
          <p>
            After all, the purpose of the Ritual of Hotu wasn’t to defeat the
            opponent. Since she had already forced Jalkato to use his full
            strength, she could still be recognized as a warrior even if she
            withdrew now…
          </p>
          <p>‘But I hate losing!’</p>
          <p>
            Siris gritted her teeth. Though she maintained a composed exterior,
            she was quite competitive by nature. Losing to someone like
            Repenhardt or Russ, who were aura users, would be understandable due
            to their different levels, but losing because of a racial ability
            despite similar skill levels felt unjust.
          </p>
          <p>‘Wait, a racial ability?’</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Siris’s eyes lit up. Jalkato was using a unique orc
            technique. Didn’t elves have their own unique techniques as well?
          </p>
          <p>Yes, they did.</p>
          <p>“Aha!”</p>
          <p>
            As if something had clicked, her eyes sparkled. Siris shouted and
            leapt high into the air. With the agility characteristic of an elf,
            her form soared far above Jalkato’s head into the sky.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Jalkato looked up, bewildered. He couldn’t comprehend his opponent’s
            actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Why is she doing such a pointless move in the middle of a fight?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Positioning oneself higher could be advantageous in combat, but
            there were limits. Jumping that high, without a foothold in the air,
            would only restrict her own movements. It was a strategy completely
            misaligned with the principles of combat.
          </p>
          <p>‘I’ve won.’</p>
          <p>
            Feeling assured, Jalkato activated Spirits Weapon, sending both
            swords hurtling into the air.
          </p>
          <p>“Go, my allies!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, a soft, almost melodious voice rang out from above
            Jalkato’s head.
          </p>
          <p>“My friend Sarana, I call upon you in the name of friendship…”</p>
          <p>
            With her song-like voice, a gust of wind began to gather in the air.
            The swirling currents of the atmosphere twisted and turned, forming
            the shape of a cute girl.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, who had been observing the fight, looked astonished.
          </p>
          <p>“The Wind Spirit, Sarana?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt knew well that Siris had been dedicating herself to the
            practice of spirit magic whenever she had the chance since leaving
            the Dahnhaim clan. He had been slightly annoyed that he had no time
            to teach her magic because of this. However, he hadn’t expected her
            to have reached a level where she could manifest a spirit already.
          </p>
          <p>‘Even with Nihillen’s help, that’s impressive progress.’</p>
          <p>
            The summoned Wind Spirit, Sarana, appeared gracefully and spoke in a
            mystical voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Did you call for me, my friend Serendi…?”</p>
          <p>She was just about to continue her elegant speech when—</p>

          <p>Thud!</p>
          <p>Siris stomped on the spirit’s head!</p>
          <p>“Squawk!”</p>
          <p>
            A very human-like scream emerged from the mouth of the otherwise
            mystical Wind Spirit. Using Sarana as a foothold, Siris propelled
            herself back into the air. Jalkato’s eyes widened as he had thrown
            his swords, anticipating her descent.
          </p>
          <p>“What the…?”</p>
          <p>
            In an instant, Siris landed behind Jalkato and pointed her sword at
            his neck.
          </p>
          <p>“Checkmate!”</p>
          <p>
            Jalkato let out a groan and admitted defeat. Stalla raised her hand
            and shouted loudly.
          </p>
          <p>“The outsider has won!”</p>
          <p>Siris returned to her comrades, and Sillan fussed over her.</p>
          <p>“Are you okay, Siris? Are you hurt anywhere?”</p>
          <p>“I’m fine, Sillan.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt also patted her head gently.</p>
          <p>“Well done, Siris.”</p>
          <p>“Thank you, Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris smiled warmly at her welcoming companions. Tilla suddenly
            looked worried.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But was it okay to stomp on her like that? She seemed pretty
            upset…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Tilla had seen it clearly. The Wind Spirit, Sarana, had been
            muttering something under her breath as she faded away after being
            rudely used as a stepping stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Her expression looked completely crushed, so I doubt she has any
            good feelings about it,” Siris said, turning her head to feign
            disinterest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt added, trying to reassure everyone, “Spirits are pure
            beings, connected to the very essence of nature. They don’t remember
            minor events like humans do.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, by the time Sarana was summoned again, she would
            have forgotten what had happened. Russ muttered with his mouth
            agape.
          </p>
          <p>“Is she like a goldfish?”</p>
          <p>The image of the mysterious spirit took a significant hit.</p>
          <p>
            Regardless, it was clear that using a spirit in such a manner was
            not the best approach. Siris silently reflected on her actions.
          </p>
          <p>“Sigh, I shouldn’t do that next time…”</p>
          <p>
            Hearing her low mutter, Repenhardt gave a wry smile. He remembered
            well. Using the Wind Spirit as a stepping stone mid-air had been one
            of her favorite techniques in her past life.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘At one point, she summoned and stepped on twelve spirits at once,
            didn’t she?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite treating spirits roughly, she had mastered all seven forms
            of spirit magic, which was both impressive and perplexing.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘By the end, the Wind Spirits would willingly support her with their
            hands, so it must not have bothered them too much.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Having been stepped on so often, the Wind Spirits eventually began
            to provide a platform for her on their own. This had led Repenhardt
            to academically ponder whether spirits truly forgot the past.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Anyway, Siris… She’s extremely polite usually, but once she gets
            close to someone, she tends to treat them a bit roughly.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing Repenhardt staring at her blankly, Siris glanced back as if
            to ask what was wrong. Shaking his head, Repenhardt looked away. In
            the distance, Stalla was shouting again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Ritual of Hotu, the second duel will now commence! Those who
            wish to prove their worth, step forward!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Although they couldn’t understand Orcish, everyone could guess what
            Stalla was saying from the tone and context. Tilla grabbed her
            battle axe with a smile.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright! It’s my turn now.”</p>
