          <p>[ Chapter 31: Redanti’s Grace ]</p>
          <p>
            『Redanti’s Grace』 was one of the most famous restaurants in
            Zeppelin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Named after the goddess of earth and abundance, Redanti, the
            restaurant had a reputation worthy of bearing the goddess’s name. It
            was prestigious, having not one but three chefs who had been
            directly under the service of kings across the continent, and it had
            a contract with the mage’s guild to preserve out-of-season
            ingredients fresh for their dishes, which earned it high fame among
            gourmets from various countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The prices, of course, were beyond imagination. The cost of
            ingredients alone was in another dimension due to the use of magic
            for preservation, and most of the chefs received a salary at the
            level of moderate nobility, making it so that a meal could only be
            paid for with gold coins, and not any other currency.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason they could boldly display such a blasphemous sign was
            that the restaurant was operated by the Redanti Order’s Zeppelin
            Diocese. Officially, the doctrine justified their actions by stating
            that processing and sharing the earth’s bounty with people was a
            duty of those who worshiped the goddess. However, it seemed more
            like they continued because it was a lucrative business.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Shouldn’t they be providing the food for free if they really want
            to share?” Sillan grumbled, looking at the feast laid out on the
            table. As a priest of Philanence, he had quite a few complaints
            about the Redanti Order’s interpretation of doctrine, which seemed
            too focused on profit. Repenhardt chuckled at his comment.
          </p>
          <p>“Doesn’t the Philanence Order run similar businesses?”</p>
          <p>
            The Philanence Order, dedicated to the goddess of love, beauty, and
            mercy, set up aesthetic salons in each diocese to run a beauty
            business targeting noblewomen. Honestly, they were in no position to
            criticize the Redanti Order.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s because it’s a natural duty under the goddess of love and
            beauty, and it doesn’t contradict our teachings. But this is
            different, isn’t it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I heard the Philanence aesthetic salons charge quite a bit of gold
            as well.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s true, but…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan stumbled for a rebuttal, then seized on another point of
            contention.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Anyway, how is a lobster considered a product of the earth? If
            they’re going to stick to doctrine, they should remove seafood from
            the menu altogether.”
          </p>
          <p>But because it was delicious, he continued to eat. Yum yum.</p>
          <p>
            Currently, they were enjoying the course meals served on the second
            floor of “Redanti’s Grace.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the dishes were exceptional. Even Sillan, who had enjoyed
            decent meals as a high-ranking cleric, realized here for the first
            time that meat dishes could be delicious without mint.
          </p>
          <p>
            Venison thighs roasted with fragrant herbs and apricot bread that
            melted softly in the mouth, along with fish dishes that seemed
            freshly caught even in the dead of winter, were served one after the
            other. Sillan constantly grumbled as he continued to stuff his mouth
            with the food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cutting generous slices of steak and bringing them to his mouth,
            Repenhardt kept stealing glances at Siris. True to her elven nature,
            she was eating a salad made from fresh vegetables, white bread, and
            fruits like apples and figs soaked in honey. While chewing on bread,
            Repenhardt struck up a conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You’ve undergone Slayer training, right? What kind of weapons did
            you primarily learn to use?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Though he already knew the answer, it was a topic he brought up with
            the purpose of starting a conversation. After swallowing her
            vegetables, she quietly responded.
          </p>
          <p>“Daggers and longsword skills, whip technique, and archery.”</p>
          <p>“Then we’ll need to prepare weapons, won’t we?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            With that curt reply, Siris returned her focus to her meal.
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue, finding it difficult to initiate
            conversation.
          </p>
          <p>‘Tsk, does she not like it here either?’</p>

          <p>
            In fact, this place was one Siris from his past life had greatly
            enjoyed, especially the menu they were currently savoring.
            Therefore, commemorating the day they first met, it had been their
            small pleasure to dine here once a year. After establishing the
            Antares Empire and being dubbed the Demon King, it became a place
            they could no longer visit, a fact Siris had found regrettable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite ordering her favorite food at her favored location, the
            table felt as if a cold wind was blowing across it.
          </p>
          <p>‘She’s so cold…’</p>
          <p>
            The overlap of Siris in her past life, whispering words of love,
            made the current Siris seem all the more unfamiliar. Even when they
            first met, the past Siris had been without smiles. But the look in
            her eyes was different. Although void, it did not harbor the
            feelings of hostility and contempt present now.
          </p>
          <p>‘Maybe it’s too early for us to have met?’</p>
          <p>However, Repenhardt had overlooked something critical.</p>
          <p>In the past, he appeared before Siris as a savior.</p>
          <p>But now, he stood before Siris as a buyer.</p>
          <p>
            A single word’s difference, but the implications were worlds apart.
            Honestly, how could Siris view Repenhardt favorably? In her past
            life, having been rescued from abuse, it was natural not to feel any
            hostility, but now the circumstances were completely different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unaware of this, Repenhardt speculated that perhaps because Siris
            was still in her girlhood, she might have an instinctive repulsion
            towards men.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, maybe someday she’ll recognize my sincerity?’</p>
          <p>
            Whether in a past life or now, Siris was just Siris—a destined lover
            whom he was fated to love. Thus, it would all eventually flow
            according to destiny.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though it wasn’t the reunion he had hoped for, Repenhardt was not
            disappointed. Even though her attitude towards him was cold, he
            noticed her expression soften slightly while she was eating the
            quince preserves, which suggested she didn’t dislike the food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smiled gently, feeling content just watching Siris enjoy
            her meal.
          </p>
          <p>‘This is enough for now.’</p>
          <p>
            After finishing the meal, Repenhardt immediately sought out a weapon
            shop. He intended to buy a weapon for Siris. This time, Siris
            herself chose the weapon. Unlike clothes, it was quite important to
            personally test how well a weapon fit one’s hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the food bought from “Redanti’s Grace” was delicious.
            Truly delicious.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, who had ordered her favorite menu items in the first
            place, knew it would be impossible for her not to like it.
            Externally, Siris maintained a cold demeanor, but internally, she
            was so delighted by the taste that she almost cried.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unwilling to admit it, she had unconsciously developed a slight
            fondness for this ‘insane, giant pervert of an owner.’ Hence, this
            time, Siris willingly played along with Repenhardt’s role-playing.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Now, customer, this is the best quality we have in our shop. You
            won’t find it anywhere else. Euhaha.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The shop owner proudly presented various types of rapiers, daggers,
            and dirks, boasting about them one after another.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s spending spree continued, selecting only the
            top-quality items. Even the cheapest dirk was a dwarf-made blend of
            magical metal mithril.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few hundred years ago, such items could only be owned by nobility
            or royalty. However, in the current era, most dwarves were enslaved
            and worked under humans in mass production systems, so items made of
            mithril were somewhat available in the market.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, they were still considered precious. It was only possible
            to find such items in a major commercial city like Zeppelin.
          </p>
          <p>“How about it, Siris? Do you see anything you like?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt cautiously glanced at Siris’s eyes as he asked. She was
            busy assessing the balance of a rapier forged from a mithril and
            steel alloy. Noticing this, Repenhardt suddenly suggested,
          </p>

          <p>“Hmm, wouldn’t this one be better than that?”</p>
          <p>
            He pointed to a silver-gray scimitar located to the left of the
            displayed weapons. Like the rapier, it was an item forged from an
            alloy of mithril and steel. Siris was momentarily surprised.
          </p>
          <p>‘No?’</p>
          <p>
            Normally, the majority of Slayers would use rapiers. This was due to
            most female swordsmen in adventure stories using them. Consequently,
            she unconsciously chose it as well. It wasn’t that she was trying to
            role-play, but she had unwittingly assumed that Repenhardt would
            prefer such tastes.
          </p>
          <p>“Why do you recommend this one?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris asked with a doubtful look. Repenhardt replied without much
            thought.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? Didn’t you originally use a scimitar?”</p>
          <p>
            In fact, the weapon that Siris was most proficient with was indeed a
            scimitar, a type of curved sword. The rapier, being primarily for
            thrusting, was useful against humans or humanoid species but not as
            effective against giant monsters. Although she had learned to use
            it, she did not particularly like it.
          </p>
          <p>‘But how does he know that?’</p>
          <p>
            It sounded as if he was well aware of Siris’s skills. He had already
            seemed to know her preferences surprisingly well, whether it was
            choosing clothes or ordering from a restaurant menu. And they had
            only met today!
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, realizing his mistake from Siris’s suspicious
            expression, stiffened his face.
          </p>
          <p>‘Uh, I’ve made a mistake. What excuse should I make?’</p>
          <p>
            Unless he was a stalker, how could he possibly know the tastes and
            abilities of a woman he had met for the first time today? Repenhardt
            felt awkward and blamed himself. As if his image wasn’t bad enough,
            would he now be accused of being a stalker too?
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Siris hadn’t thought that far. To infiltrate the heavily
            guarded Elvenheim to the extent of stalking, one would have to be a
            legendary master thief. Surely such a master of stealth wouldn’t be
            stalking an elf slave?
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, she remained puzzled. While Siris was feeling perplexed,
            Repenhardt was struggling until Sillan threw him a lifeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, it’s said that a master martial artist can recognize a
            familiar weapon just by looking at the hands, Mr. Repenhardt, isn’t
            it amazing?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris looked convinced. Of course, there was no such skill, but
            Repenhardt did his best to maintain such an impression. And
            internally, he was grateful to Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>‘Thank you, Sillan.’</p>
          <p>
            Having finished arming themselves, Repenhardt and his party left the
            weapon shop. As a token of gratitude for the help, Repenhardt showed
            a generous gesture by buying Sillan a mithril dagger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan didn’t know the first thing about dagger techniques, but
            still, having a dagger was useful in many ways, especially since it
            was a dwarf-made mithril weapon. Sillan was delighted with this
            unexpected find, grinning from ear to ear.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, I’ve seen a lot, but this is the first time I’ve ever gotten
            my hands on a mithril weapon.”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt gave a wry smile.</p>
          <p>“Well… You’re a priest. When would you need to wield a weapon?”</p>
          <p>
            Unless he was a martial artist monk, a holy warrior cleric, or a
            holy knight paladin, the situation must be dire for Sillan, a pure
            cleric, to need to wield a weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Sillan kept fidgeting with the dagger, smiling broadly. It
            seemed that, still being a boy, he was happy to have acquired a
            precious weapon.
          </p>

          <p>
            As they were leaving the weapons shop and heading towards an inn, a
            group of burly men blocked their way just as they were crossing an
            intersection.
          </p>
          <p>“Excuse me, I have something to say to you.”</p>
          <p>
            Their fierce looks made it clear they weren’t the kind to lead a
            quiet life. Moreover, all of them were armed. Repenhardt stepped
            forward, on guard.
          </p>
          <p>“What is it?”</p>
          <p>
            The middle-aged man who appeared to be the leader glanced behind
            Repenhardt and then spoke.
          </p>
          <p>“Is that slave the one you bought today from Elvenheim?”</p>
          <p>“And if she is?”</p>
          <p>
            The man stroked his chin, scanning Repenhardt from head to toe
            before arrogantly continuing.
          </p>
          <p>“A person of importance wants that elf female.”</p>
          <p>
            The mention of Siris in such a manner made Repenhardt’s blood
            pressure rise. However, it wasn’t wise to lash out at these men
            here, given the many onlookers. Repenhardt retorted sullenly.
          </p>
          <p>“So, what about it?”</p>
          <p>
            “We’ll pay you well for the slave. If you wish, we can exchange her
            for another, proper slayer. Here, take a look at this certified bill
            of exchange.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The man then unfolded a bill of exchange from Elvenheim. The seal
            was clearly stamped, proving it wasn’t a forgery but a legitimate
            bill. In Zeppelin city, within the Chatan Duchy, using a forged bill
            could result in being torn limb from limb. Murder might be settled
            with money, but forgery of a bill was considered a heinous crime in
            this country that worshiped gold.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he finished speaking, the man gestured for his companions to
            bring the elf. His demeanor suggested he hadn’t even considered the
            possibility of refusal. Repenhardt stepped in front of Siris,
            blocking her path, with a visibly displeased expression.
          </p>
          <p>“You have no business here.”</p>
          <p>
            The man’s face shifted to one of incredulous disbelief. Such a
            response was unexpected, and he even wondered if he had misheard.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? Are you saying you’re refusing?”</p>
          <p>“That’s right.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s firm stance left the middle-aged man looking
            bewildered. It was something he couldn’t comprehend. He had never
            imagined someone would refuse to exchange a thrice-returned
            defective Slayer for a fine finished product.
          </p>
          <p>Frustrated, the man clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>
            “Can’t understand plain speech, can you? Didn’t I say I’d exchange
            it for something better?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Can’t understand plain speech, huh? Didn’t I say we have no
            business with you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt mocked him, deliberately parroting his words. The man’s
            face twisted in anger.
          </p>
          <p>“This bastard…”</p>
          <p>
            The men accompanying the middle-aged man also turned visibly red
            with anger. It seemed a fight was inevitable, prompting Repenhardt
            to discreetly protect Siris and Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>However, unexpectedly, the man quickly backed down.</p>
          <p>
            “Hmm, quite the unique fellow. Well, I can’t force you. You must be
            quite fond of that elf slave?”
          </p>
          <p>
            And with that, he peacefully retreated, leading his group away
            towards the other end of the street. His departure was a stark
            contrast to his previous arrogant tone.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s with that guy?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt let out a laugh, feeling somewhat baffled. Sillan, too,
            couldn’t help but snicker at the man’s abrupt change of attitude.
          </p>
          <p>“What a strange fellow we’ve encountered.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 32 ]</p>
          <p>
            In the outskirts of Zeppelin, at the Rolpein family manor, Teriq was
            scolding a middle-aged man with a furrowed brow.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s this? Why have you come back empty-handed, Romad!”</p>
          <p>
            Romad bowed his head and calmly narrated the situation. He had
            encountered that large, brute of an adventurer, and after finishing
            his explanation of the man’s attitude, Romad shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “He’s truly a novice. It doesn’t matter how much money you offer
            him; he’s not the type to sell out. He doesn’t understand how the
            world works.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Then you should have just roughed him up a bit and thrown some
            counterfeit money at him, shouldn’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>“That, that’s a bit…”</p>
          <p>
            Romad stammered, scratching his head. For the wealthy Teriq, beating
            someone up in broad daylight and settling the matter with gold was
            feasible, but he was just an employee. He didn’t have such money.
          </p>
          <p>
            And it wasn’t like Teriq was the kind to generously cover his
            subordinates’ misdemeanors with money. It was far more likely that
            he would dismiss him for unnecessary expenditures.
          </p>
          <p>Romad tried to calm Teriq with his words.</p>
          <p>
            “Causing a scene in public will only cost you money, right? Let’s
            just handle it according to the market’s way.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Teriq calmed down a bit at the mention of spending money. Upon
            reflection, Romad’s suggestion was sensible. Unnecessary expenses
            were to be avoided. They could simply resolve it according to the
            market.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ll just capture that Slayer and then claim she died, offering
            twice the compensation. It’ll only cost 600 gold, which is much
            cheaper than actually trading for a proper Slayer, isn’t it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            While any respectable merchant would be outraged by such logic,
            Teriq was satisfied. Indeed, according to the laws of the Lastil
            Duchy, this was the cheapest and most hassle-free solution. Sure,
            the adventurer who lost his Slayer might cause a ruckus, but they
            could easily beat him up without any guilt since it would be
            considered self-defense, hence no fine was necessary.
          </p>
          <p>It was a thoroughly satisfying idea. Teriq smiled contentedly.</p>
          <p>“That’s fine. Handle it accordingly. I’ll trust you.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, young master.”</p>
          <p>
            As Romad was about to leave the room, Teriq suddenly remembered
            something and added,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, and take Sir Lantas with you. That gentleman has been loafing
            around lately; let’s at least get some work out of his salary.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Romad’s expression brightened slightly. He, too, was discontented
            with Sir Lantas, who received an enormous salary yet did nothing but
            indulge in leisure every day.
          </p>
          <p>“An excellent decision.”</p>
          <p>Romad bowed and let out a small laugh.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Upon returning to the inn, Repenhardt found himself deep in thought.
          </p>
          <p>‘I’ve ended up with too much money left over?’</p>

          <p>
            Even after purchasing expensive clothes, meals, and choosing only
            the most costly weapons, he still had money left over. Initially, he
            had prepared 2,000 gold coins for the purchase of Siris, expecting
            to spend them all at Elvenheim. However, he managed to settle the
            deal with just 300 coins. Thus, even after deducting the cost of his
            purchases, he had close to 1,600 gold coins remaining.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Just carrying it around and using it as travel expenses could work,
            but…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Truthfully, even indulging in luxury wouldn’t consume more than 100
            gold coins. The price of a Slayer was beyond imagination. In fact,
            1,600 gold coins were a vast fortune that could change the fate of
            an ambitious merchant.
          </p>
          <p>“Wait, there’s no need to carry this around, right?”</p>
          <p>
            For an individual like Repenhardt, that amount of money was enough
            to enjoy a lifetime of wealth and honor. However, he had a
            significant task ahead – the reconstruction of the Antares Empire.
            No amount of funds could be considered too much for the
            establishment of an empire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, he decided to reinvest the majority of his funds,
            excluding a reasonable amount for travel expenses. Conveniently, he
            was in Zeppelin, where formidable trading companies from across the
            continent were gathered, making it the perfect place to find an
            investment opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>“Now, what should I invest in?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt recalled. Imagining using knowledge of the future to make
            a fortune was a common fantasy. And he was someone who actually knew
            that future.
          </p>
          <p>“It must be around that time now?”</p>
          <p>
            There had been a severe famine in the Kingdom of Crovence in the
            past. The Kingdom of Crovence, blessed by the Goddess of the Earth,
            Redanti, was a fertile land that hardly knew failure. Boasting
            bountiful harvests in both spring and autumn, it was an agricultural
            nation that exported the surplus grains.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, no one prepared for a famine. Then, a catastrophic
            famine struck. The expected barley harvest was completely ruined,
            and the kingdom’s fate was sealed after consuming all stored grains
            during the winter. Tens of thousands died of starvation, and a
            dystopia unfolded where parents resorted to cannibalism.
          </p>
          <p>
            Realizing the timing aligned with the upcoming spring after this
            winter, he thought,
          </p>
          <p>“Investing in grains would be wise.”</p>
          <p>
            He smiled. He remembered hearing drunk adult mages talk about how
            knowing the story of that famine in advance could have led to making
            a fortune. It was a chance to save people and make money, killing
            two birds with one stone.
          </p>
          <p>
            He quickly went through the list of trading companies in the
            Principality of Chatan that specialized in grains in his mind. The
            first that came to mind was naturally the Rolpein Trading Company,
            but, honestly, he harbored a lot of resentment towards them. After
            all, Siris’s abusive owner in her previous life had been the head of
            the Rolpein Trading Company. Hence, he was loath to set foot there.
          </p>
          <p>
            The next one that came to mind was another grain-specializing
            trading company that competed with the Rolpein Trading Company.
            Despite the financial pressure from the Rolpein Trading Company,
            this company had managed to excellently run its business and
            eventually climbed up to be the third-largest trading company on the
            continent.
          </p>
          <p>“The name was… Taoban Trading Company, probably?”</p>
          <p>Having made his decision, Repenhardt got up.</p>
          <p>
            Looking around, he saw that Siris was handling the newly purchased
            weapons to familiarize herself with them inside the room, and Sillan
            was clumsily trying to imitate her with the short sword he had been
            given.
          </p>
          <p>‘There’s no need to take them along.’</p>
          <p>
            Siris, he thought, deserved to rest at a comfortable inn for today
            at least. After all, they would have to embark on a grueling journey
            again tomorrow.
          </p>
          <p>“Sillan, stay and rest with Siris. I’ll be back soon.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan, who had been energetically flailing with the dagger,
            frowned.
          </p>
          <p>“Where are you going now?”</p>
          <p>“I need to visit a trading company.”</p>

          <p>
            As Repenhardt put on his coat, Sillan briefly considered following
            him. However, having just taken a lap around Zeppelin, he felt
            tired, and the fun of playing with the dagger was too good to pass
            up. Siris, not having been directly ordered, didn’t think of
            following either.
          </p>
          <p>“Take care.”</p>
          <p>Sillan waved his hand towards Repenhardt, who added,</p>
          <p>
            “Order anything you want to eat, and don’t forget to include
            something for Siris!”
          </p>
          <p>
            He had entrusted this to Sillan because Siris would never order room
            service on her own. Sillan clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s really thoughtful. Really, go and don’t worry.”</p>
          <p>
            Leaving the two at the inn, Repenhardt set out again towards the
            trading district.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a small room painted with whitewash and furnished with nothing
            more than wooden bookshelves and a table, a man in his early
            thirties was grimacing as he went through documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            In front of him, numerous documents had piled up into a mountain. He
            was in the midst of signing documents and pondering deeply,
            engrossed in calculations, when another man of a similar age entered
            the room with a troubled face.
          </p>
          <p>
            “President Siebolt, the Rolpein Trading Company has started selling
            wheat and barley at half price!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siebolt Taoban, the president of the Taoban Trading Company in his
            thirties, furrowed his brow and sighed deeply.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn them.”</p>
          <p>
            The Taoban Trading Company was currently embroiled in a fierce
            competition with the Rolpein Trading Company over grain. It was an
            era devoid of any concept of fair trade laws. Naturally, the larger
            entity could afford to push out the smaller one by taking financial
            hits and using money to overpower them. One might expect them to not
            stoop to such underhanded tactics if they had any sense of commerce
            integrity. However, Rolpein Trading Company’s infamous reputation
            was not unearned. If things continued as they were, Taoban would
            lose all its trading partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Damn it, to think that such a company is the second largest on the
            continent…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siebolt clutched at his hair, feeling a headache coming on, a
            tangible sense of how rotten the world had become. Yet, retreating
            was not an option.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If we can just stop the return bills coming due, we might find a
            way to survive…’
          </p>
          <p>
            While he was deep in thought, another subordinate cautiously opened
            the door and called out to him.
          </p>
          <p>“Excuse me, Mr. Siebolt.”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            His mood was foul, which made his tone brusque. The subordinate,
            noticing this, cautiously continued.
          </p>
          <p>“A investor has arrived.”</p>
          <p>“And?”</p>
          <p>
            At this juncture, getting a small amount of investment would hardly
            solve the immediate problems. It would only add to his troubles.
            Moreover, this was usually handled by his subordinates, and he was
            only to be informed. Why bother him directly at such a time?<br />
            There was indeed a reason.
          </p>
          <p>“The thing is, the amount is a staggering 1,500 gold coins.”</p>

          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            By the standards of a major trading company, 1,500 gold coins was
            not a significant amount. However, for the struggling Taoban Trading
            Company, it was a lifeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            If they could just get through this winter and have the grain
            shipments come in, they could cover their losses and still turn a
            significant profit. Rolpein Trading Company was employing such a
            bleeding strategy to ensure they wouldn’t survive the winter.
          </p>
          <p>Siebolt’s eyes lit up, and he rose from his seat.</p>
          <p>“Who, who is it? I must meet them in person!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt sat in the small reception room he was led to, looking
            around.
          </p>
          <p>‘Hmm, quite a modest room. Is their situation really that bad?’</p>
          <p>
            It had been quite a challenge to get here. He remembered Taoban
            Trading Company as the third-largest trading entity on the
            continent, so he had expected an imposing building. Yet, the Taoban
            branch in Zeppelin City was merely a small two-story brick building.
            Considering the land prices in this area, the funds could have
            easily built a mansion on the outskirts, but it paled in comparison
            to other trading companies’ buildings.
          </p>
          <p>
            And indeed, it wasn’t so shabby. With decent wallpaper and elegant
            furniture, the interior was sufficient to entertain guests. However,
            having grown too accustomed to the opulence of Elvenheim and the inn
            “Golden Rest,” it couldn’t help but seem somewhat poor in
            comparison.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Sigh. Have I been indulging in luxury too much lately? I need to
            exercise some restraint.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Internally reflecting, Repenhardt waited for Siebolt Taoban, the
            head of Taoban Trading Company. Shortly after, a man in his thirties
            rushed into the reception room. He was not the old man Repenhardt
            remembered, but his stubborn mouth and clear eyes immediately
            identified him as Siebolt.
          </p>
          <p>“Welcome, guest.”</p>
          <p>“My name is Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            After exchanging greetings, Repenhardt got straight to the point. He
            put down three sacks full of gold coins on the table and said,
          </p>
          <p>
            “1,500 gold coins, I wish to invest all of it in grain. The location
            is the Kingdom of Crovence, and the time is next year’s spring
            barley harvest.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siebolt, momentarily lost in the weight of the gold, asked in
            surprise,
          </p>
          <p>“Excuse me? The Kingdom of Crovence?”</p>
          <p>
            The Kingdom of Crovence was the continent’s largest granary, blessed
            by Redanti, ensuring it never suffered a poor harvest. Selling grain
            there was akin to selling a stove in the tropics—utterly senseless.
            Siebolt’s jaw dropped in disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Uh, guest. I hesitate to say this, but selling grain to the Kingdom
            of Crovence is like selling soap to orcs. It just won’t sell.”
          </p>
          <p>“Orcs get used to soap just fine if they try.”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>“Ah, never mind. It’s nothing.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had inadvertently mentioned a story from a past life.
          </p>
          <p>
            He chuckled bitterly. Honestly, he understood Siebolt’s attitude. If
            he didn’t know the future, he would have considered such an
            investment folly as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If it fails, I’m the one who loses, right? But if it profits,
            you’ll gain a substantial benefit too.”
          </p>
          <p>“That may be true, but…”</p>
          <p>
            Siebolt fiddled with his lips, troubled. That money could certainly
            solve his current difficulties. However, his merchant spirit
            couldn’t simply agree to a clearly doomed investment.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Still, I can’t recommend an investment that’s bound to fail.
            Perhaps you should reconsider…”
          </p>
          <p>“If you’re not interested, I’ll look elsewhere.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt didn’t have much attachment to the Taoban Trading
            Company. His choice was initially driven solely by his dislike for
            the Rolpein Trading Company, so opting for another company posed no
            issue for him.

          <p>[ Chapter 33 ]</p>
          <p>Siebolt was taken aback and blurted out nonsense in surprise.</p>
          <p>“No, that can’t be done!”</p>
          <p>
            Realizing his slip, he clicked his tongue in regret. The urgency of
            the situation had made him behave in a manner unbecoming of a
            merchant. Repenhardt observed Siebolt with a slightly surprised
            look.
          </p>
          <p>‘It must be a dire situation, huh?’</p>
          <p>
            He wondered if he had come to the right place at all. Was this about
            fleeing before even risking an investment?
          </p>
          <p>
            Siebolt sighed deeply at his own mistake and then began to speak
            honestly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “To be frank, our company is not in a good situation right now.
            However, with this money, we can certainly survive this period and
            grow. Therefore, I would prefer to recommend a different
            investment.”
          </p>
          <p>“It’s my downfall if it fails, so you say.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue. This man, as meticulous in his
            previous life, had it in his nature. Yet, seeing this side of him
            only increased Repenhardt’s trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s my money, and I decide how to use it. Now, bring the
            contract.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Pushing forward the gold coins, he pressed on aggressively. At this
            point, Siebolt could no longer refuse. Having explained all the
            risks and yet being accepted, there was no breach of merchant honor,
            and above all, the gold in front of him was too tempting.
            Considering the many people dependent on him within the Taoban
            Trading Company, refusing was also a sin.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Understood, Lord Repenhardt. I will prepare the contract
            immediately.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siebolt called his subordinate to begin drafting the documents.
            Repenhardt smiled gently.
          </p>
          <p>
            “All I want is one thing, not to preemptively invest my money
            elsewhere.”
          </p>
          <p>“Of course.”</p>
          <p>
            Once accepted, it was a merchant’s duty to follow through
            thoroughly. Repenhardt was satisfied, trusting in the memories of
            his previous life. Then, a sudden thought crossed his mind.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, and this is a bit of a separate issue…”</p>
          <p>“Is there something you need?”</p>
          <p>
            “Does the Taoban Trading Company have a branch in the Graim Kingdom?
            Possibly?”
          </p>

          <p>
            Siebolt nodded. They had indeed opened a new route to the northern
            part of the Graim Kingdom not too long ago.
          </p>
          <p>“Then, do you have a branch near the Tower of Delphia?”</p>
          <p>
            “We don’t have one in Delphia, but the branch in the Lonta region
            does pass through Delphia. What is it for?”
          </p>
          <p>“I need someone there to be looked into.”</p>
          <p>
            This was an opportunity to gather information about Repenhardt in
            the current era. How he was doing, if there was anything unusual,
            especially how he had been over the last few years, he requested
            specific details.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ll pay you separately for this effort………….”</p>
          <p>“There’s no need. I will contact them immediately.”</p>
          <p>Siebolt firmly waved his hand.</p>
          <p>
            If it was a deal with this investor, it wasn’t a problem at all to
            hire someone to gather that level of information. It wasn’t
            confidential information of royalty or nobility, so it was fine to
            just ask the nearby merchants for news.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Good, I can also obtain the information I couldn’t get from Todd
            with this.’
          </p>
          <p>Chortling, Repenhardt dipped his feather pen in ink.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The silver dagger danced in the air, casting delicate sword lights
            as it slashed, chopped, and stabbed through the air. Feeling the
            texture of the sword handle wrap around her hand, Siris faintly
            smiled.
          </p>
          <p>
            She loved the sword. Only in the moments of wielding it could she
            forget the fact that she was a slave.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris, unlike the other elves at the auction, was not born a slave.
            She was born in the wastelands of the western continent, in the
            Dahnheim Forest, a place her tribe called the Land of Wailing.
          </p>
          <p>
            After losing the great homeland of the elves’ forest and being
            chased for hundreds of years, they barely arrived in a land of
            refuge. In the barren wilderness, where merely surviving was an
            ordeal, she was born and raised.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her childhood, now faint in her memory, the adults would always
            say,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Originally, we high elves were the guardians of the forest. Under
            the blessing of the World Tree Elvenheim, all elves lived in eternal
            happiness. All animals were friends of the elves, and every tree
            bore fruits that endlessly provided food.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Given their daily struggle to feed themselves in the barren land, it
            was a story they could hardly believe. The tales of the past elves,
            who lived a noble life in harmony with nature as forest fairies,
            seemed like a dream or fantasy.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Though we have been driven to this plight by the despicable humans,
            someday Eldia will look after us and lead us back to paradise.”
          </p>
          <p>Eldia, the goddess of the elves.</p>

          <p>
            The belief that someday, a great emissary of the goddess would
            descend to save all elves was widespread among the Dahnheim tribe.
            Young Siris also firmly believed in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We are the descendants of the great fairies. Our beloved daughter,
            you must never forget that dignity.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Every adult elf was her father and her mother. She grew up in the
            love of numerous parents. It was a poor and hungry life, but it was
            still a happy one.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was shattered when she turned twenty years old, which would be
            considered five in human years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slave hunters, having acquired information about a region where
            ‘wild’ elves were said to be found, mobilized a massive force to
            invade her homeland. Suddenly faced with the army of humans, the
            elves fiercely resisted. Everyone fought without sparing their lives
            for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the disparity in forces was too great. Eventually, after a
            desperate struggle, the adults all perished, and the children were
            sold into slavery by the slave hunters.
          </p>
          <p>
            In her younger days, knowing nothing and only able to cry, the shock
            she felt when she was dragged to the auction house and met other
            elves remained vaguely in her memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            They mocked the Dahnheim clan. It was said that it was impossible
            for the elf race, known for being slaves, to have such a past. What
            the Dahnheim clan believed in was nothing but a legend born out of
            desperate hope. They dismissed the ‘savior legend’ that was common
            everywhere, rattling off similar tales one after the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            An elderly elf woman she met in Elvenheim had consoled her, saying,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Isn’t it fortunate that you’ve come to know the world now? You’re
            beautiful, so you’ll be sold to a good place. You’re young, so if
            you learn loyalty and politeness here from now on, you’ll become a
            good elf.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And time passed. Siris too began to forget her past. The world was
            different from what she had heard. Elves were slaves. Everyone took
            it for granted. She, who had been rebellious, gradually became
            accustomed to Elvenheim.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Siris never fully surrendered in her heart. Even as she obeyed
            orders, her eyes always shone with defiance. Despite being starved
            and whipped countless times, that light in her eyes never changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other elves mocked her. Even the fact that she was a pure-blooded
            High Elf was a subject of ridicule there. Among the elves, they were
            the most noble clan that shone brightly in pure white. However, her
            sun-tanned, dusky skin became a symbol of the fall of the High
            Elves.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only salvation for her, an outsider even among slaves, was the
            sword. Recognizing Siris’s talent, a swordsmanship instructor in
            Elvenheim placed her in the Slayer curriculum. Thus, unlike other
            slaves, she was able to learn swordsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elves in Elvenheim who were not Slayers did not learn the sword.
            What they learned were solely various tricks to please humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in her memories, all the elders wielded swords. They were free
            elves who knew how to defend themselves with their swords. Everyone
            was brave and died fighting with pride. She still faintly remembered
            seeing one of the slave hunters, having suffered a severe loss,
            making a grieving face as they were captured.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the sword was cherished. Wielding it, she could recall the
            proud figures of her fathers and mothers. In a world of isolation,
            the sword was her only joy. Even knowing that it was an effort to
            become a more expensive slave, she was enchanted by swordsmanship
            and devoted herself to it.
          </p>
          <p>
            50 years passed like this. The young child had grown into a mature
            girl. 50 years was a long time, even for an elf. Much of the past
            had already been forgotten. She had grown accustomed to living as a
            slave. The concept of living freely was now barely a memory.
          </p>
          <p>However……</p>
          <p>
            Though it was a story from a time so long ago that the memories were
            blurry…..
          </p>

          <p>A small phrase, treasured in a corner of those hazy memories.</p>
          <p>‘My beloved daughter, you must never forget your pride.’</p>
          <p>
            When she swung her sword, it seemed as if she could faintly hear
            that voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Hoo…….”</p>
          <p>
            After finishing her sword dance, Siris breathed lightly. Sillan, who
            had been watching Siris’s dagger technique demonstration in awe,
            couldn’t help but exclaim.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow! That’s amazing!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris and Sillan were out in the inn’s garden. It was Sillan who had
            begged Siris to teach him some dagger techniques after getting his
            hands on a mithril dagger. Since performing the sword dance in the
            room seemed a bit risky – considering they had booked the most
            expensive room and were worried about damaging the furniture – they
            had moved to the garden.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite it being the middle of winter, both were only wearing light
            coats. However, they didn’t seem to be cold. The coats were of high
            quality, boasting excellent insulation, and the “Golden Rest,” where
            they were staying, had the garden set in the center of the U-shaped
            building. Being surrounded by the building on all sides blocked the
            wind, significantly increasing the perceived temperature.
          </p>
          <p>Receiving the dagger from Siris, Sillan asked.</p>
          <p>“How can you make such moves?”</p>
          <p>“If you work hard, you can do it.”</p>
          <p>
            Although the voice was brusque, Sillan seemed not to care at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, that’s exactly what Repenhardt said. Is that how all martial
            artists respond?”
          </p>
          <p>“It’s not so much that…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris grimaced with a bitter smile. Unless one is taught the basics
            properly, what else could be said in response to how those movements
            are performed?
          </p>
          <p>“Uh, is this how it’s done?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan began to mimic Siris’s sword dance after taking a dagger. The
            sharp trajectory disappeared as the dagger flailed through the air.
            Then, scratching his head, his fine red hair fluttered about.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, this is harder than it looks.”</p>
          <p>“It doesn’t happen overnight.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite her cool tone, Siris was responding diligently to Sillan’s
            words. Was her attitude somewhat different from when dealing with
            Repenhardt?
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, Siris had taken a liking to this small, beautiful boy
            priest. Being a woman, she naturally took a liking to beautiful
            things. Moreover, his personality was pleasant, treating her, a
            slave, quite kindly. It seemed he was a bit wary around her, which
            was a completely different reaction from the humans Siris had
            encountered before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Sillan’s attitude was more akin to a poor commoner
            marveling and cautiously admiring a rare breed of cat, rather than
            treating Siris as a sentient being. But for Siris, it was pleasing
            nonetheless.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm, should I start with the basics? How should I do it?”</p>
          <p>“First, you need to get comfortable with how to hold a sword.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris took Sillan’s hand and corrected his posture. It was
            uncharacteristic for her to be holding a human man’s hand first, but
            she felt no wariness towards this young boy.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of racial age, Siris was now over seventeen, and Sillan was
            nineteen, so it wasn’t quite right to say he was younger. However,
            Repenhardt had taught Siris that Sillan was a man but hadn’t
            informed her of his age. Thus, Siris was under the impression that
            Sillan was at most three or four years old, treating him like a cute
            younger brother.

          <p>[ Chapter 34 ]</p>
          <p>
            In the central garden of the inn, Sillan and Siris were leisurely
            spending their time when their peace was abruptly disturbed.
          </p>
          <p>“There you are.”</p>
          <p>
            Loud footsteps announced the arrival of a group of men through the
            main pillar, making their way into the garden. Leading them was a
            middle-aged man wielding a sword, at whom Sillan frowned.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a familiar face. He was the very man from the street earlier,
            who had tried to buy Siris.
          </p>
          <p>“What do you want?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan stepped in front of Siris, on high alert. Romad, observing
            this, wore a pleased smile, thinking things were going as planned.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Such a greenhorn. To think he hadn’t considered the possibility of
            this happening.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, he had planned to lure Repenhardt away by sending
            someone for him, and in his absence, snatch the elf maid. After all,
            one cannot simply kidnap a slave in front of their owner. Yet, upon
            arriving at the inn, he found his target conveniently alone.
          </p>
          <p>“I have no business with you. Move aside!”</p>
          <p>Romad barked an order, then gestured with his hand.</p>
          <p>“Come, elf wench. I’ll take you to your rightful master.”</p>
          <p>
            His voice was shamelessly bold. Three robust men, armed with ropes
            and clubs, approached Siris, effectively surrounding her. In a
            panic, Sillan shouted again.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey! What do you think you’re doing?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan glanced at the inn’s windows, puzzled. Despite the commotion,
            not a single person looked out. Romad let out a guffaw.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I see what you were hoping for, but the guests are all in the hall
            right now.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He had already bribed the innkeeper to gather all the guests in the
            hall under the pretense of a free dinner banquet. Given their
            lodging in such a place, it was presumed they were well-off, yet
            none could resist the lure of a complimentary meal.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, we already said we wouldn’t sell her! What kind of outrage is
            this!”
          </p>
          <p>
            In a fluster, Sillan faced aggression as one of the men swung his
            club at him.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, such a noisy brat!”</p>
          <p>
            In a flash, Siris stepped forward, quickly positioning herself in
            front of Sillan and skillfully disarming him of his dagger. The
            swift action left even Sillan, who was disarmed, clueless about what
            had just happened.
          </p>
          <p>Then, she lunged forward with a low stance.</p>
          <p>“Ugh?”</p>
          <p>
            The man, taken aback, swung his club down in a well-trained and
            deliberate attack, not merely flailing but executing a skilled move.
            However, Siris deflected the attack with the dagger and struck the
            man’s throat with the other hand, using a technique known as the
            “night fist,” where the middle knuckle is slightly protruded.
          </p>

          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            It was a movement swift as lightning. The man choked and collapsed
            immediately.
          </p>
          <p>The two fellows to his left and right rushed over in panic.</p>
          <p>“This… this wench!”</p>
          <p>
            The two men charged at Siris, attacking her from both sides. They
            cleverly used the snap of their wrist to swing their staffs,
            striking both vertically and horizontally at the same time,
            effectively blocking any escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Siris was not at all flustered. Maintaining her usual
            expressionless face, she stood her ground, twisting her body. She
            narrowly dodged the left attack over her shoulder and caught the
            opposite stick with the side of her blade. Riding the momentum, she
            slashed at the man’s wrist.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            Blood spurted as the man clutched his wrist in agony. Seizing the
            moment, Siris spun around and swung her dagger widely at the
            opposite side. The motion was so large that the other man easily
            dodged and counterattacked.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that instant, she used her rotational force to plant a back kick
            into the man’s solar plexus. The swing of her dagger had been a
            feint all along.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            The man groaned in pain as his stomach turned. Siris’s dagger then
            danced, targeting his vitals. In a flash, the mithril blade deeply
            pierced the man’s shoulder.
          </p>
          <p>“Agh!”</p>
          <p>
            As the blade was withdrawn, red blood soaked his garments. Overcome
            with pain, the men staggered back. Romad’s expression hardened in
            surprise at the ease with which Siris dispatched the three
            formidable men.
          </p>
          <p>‘Huh, what?’</p>
          <p>
            Although they seemed easily defeated and unimpressive, in reality,
            the three subordinates he had sent were far from weak. Romad knew
            well that Siris was a Slayer, an elf slave trained in combat skills.
            He had chosen men capable of facing a Slayer to come here. With
            Teriq, who also had three Slayers under his command, Romad had a
            good grasp of a Slayer’s combat capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>But Siris’s skill was unexpectedly beyond anticipation.</p>
          <p>‘She’s too strong, isn’t she?’</p>
          <p>
            Her ability to exploit the weaknesses in an attack and the speed
            with which she switched between offense and defense were practically
            invisible. Romad felt even he might not stand a chance against her.
            Moreover, her indifference to shedding blood? That was a level of
            prowess expected of a skilled knight or an experienced Slayer, not
            something a newly made (?) Slayer would possess.
          </p>
          <p>“What, what’s this?”</p>
          <p>“Did brother Smith get defeated?”</p>
          <p>
            The murmurs of the men who had come with Romad were audible.
            Although six of his underlings remained, all of them were
            significantly less skilled than the three who had just fallen. Their
            usual roles were to act as lookouts or to intimidate with numbers,
            so they stood no chance against that elf girl.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it…”</p>
          <p>
            Romad clicked his tongue, finally snapping Sillan out of his daze,
            his face flushing with anger. It was clear he was highly agitated.
            Sillan raised his divine power and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“You scoundrels! I’ll wash your faces with sulfuric acid!”</p>
          <p>
            Despite his pretty appearance, Sillan had quite the temper.
            Moreover, he was a high-ranking priest in the Philanence Order. To
            swing a club at him?
          </p>

          <p>Sillan immediately began to pray.</p>
          <p>
            “Oh Philanence, bestow your divine mace upon these irreverent
            souls………..”
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Siris grabbed Sillan and yanked him to the side. The
            sound of the wind whistling past Sillan’s ear followed as he failed
            his prayer in surprise. A dagger was deeply embedded in the tree
            trunk that was behind him moments ago. Romad had thrown the dagger
            at Sillan as he attempted to cast a divine spell.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan’s face turned pale.</p>
          <p>‘Is he trying to kill me?’</p>
          <p>Romad stared at Sillan with a stern face and warned.</p>
          <p>
            “Shut your mouth. Even a murmur, and the next one goes through you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a chilling voice. Sillan, overwhelmed by the intense
            murderous intent, cried out in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“I am a servant of Philanence!”</p>
          <p>
            It was uncommon for even the most corrupt individuals to harm those
            who served the goddess. Romad scoffed at Sillan’s outcry.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph. Just a pilgrim brat. No one’s going to fuss over one or two
            dead bodies.”
          </p>
          <p>Romad, in fact, had no interest in Sillan’s life or death.</p>
          <p>
            He had already identified Sillan as a clergyman by his attire when
            they met on the street. However, the robes Sillan wore belonged to
            the Philanence Order. The Philanence Order’s influence was growing
            mainly in the southern part of the continent, and there was yet to
            be a temple in the Chatan Principality. This meant the kid was
            undoubtedly a pilgrim, a soul no one would miss if killed.
          </p>
          <p>“What kind of people are these?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan ground his teeth in anger, but his complexion was pale. He
            had often heard tales of pilgrims dying on the streets, but he never
            imagined he would end up in such a situation.
          </p>
          <p>Then, Siris whispered to Sillan, comforting him.</p>
          <p>“It’s okay.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan turned in surprise. The voice was not the cold one he had
            grown accustomed to. It was soft, even tender to the ears.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris?”</p>
          <p>
            She took a stance. Slightly bending her knees and aiming her dagger
            at Romad, she brought her other hand under her chin. With a
            determined attitude, she muttered,
          </p>
          <p>“There’s no problem.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan was a bit startled. The appearance Siris presented now was
            unlike any Slayer he knew. Slayers who swung their swords solely for
            their master’s praise never had such a look in their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a determined gaze, filled with resolve and pride, the gaze of
            a warrior.
          </p>
          <p>
            Romad was certainly taken aback by Siris’s skill. However, he wasn’t
            embarrassed.
          </p>

          <p>
            He was cautious by nature and fully aware that he might have to face
            Repenhardt if things went south. Even if deemed a novice adventurer,
            being able to earn 300 gold coins as a Slayer’s fee clearly
            indicated significant skill. Thus, he had prepared another strong
            contender just in case.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Just didn’t think I’d have to use him against a rookie Slayer,
            though.’
          </p>
          <p>Clicking his tongue, Romad called out,</p>
          <p>“It’s time to work. Talkata!”</p>
          <p>“Yes, master.”</p>
          <p>
            With a deep voice, a figure emerged from the shadows behind a
            column. An Orc man with gray skin, a flat nose, and thick tusks. He
            was about the same height as Romad, but his build was entirely
            different. His shoulders were incredibly broad, and his body was
            covered in bulging muscles.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan immediately recognized the identity of the Orc.</p>
          <p>“An Orc gladiator….”</p>
          <p>
            He was protected by leather armor at vital points, but the exposed
            areas were covered in scars. The fact that an Orc, a slave race, had
            so many scars, and was still alive, proved that he was a
            professionally trained gladiator.
          </p>
          <p>“Talkata works. I catch that elf.”</p>
          <p>“That’s right. Work. Catch her now!”</p>
          <p>“Yes, master.”</p>
          <p>
            As Talkata sluggishly walked away, Romad sent a confident gaze
            towards his back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Slayers and Orc gladiators, although both specialized in combat
            techniques, differed fundamentally in their innate combat abilities.
            Unlike ordinary Orc slaves, who were brainwashed from a young age to
            suppress their ferocity, gladiators retained their barbaric
            strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Moreover, it’s unthinkable for a female to defeat a male, isn’t
            it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a triumphant smile, Romad shouted, “Finish it quickly! We can’t
            afford to waste time!”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was nearing the end of dinner time. It would be troublesome if
            the inn’s guests started returning to their rooms.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Orc gladiator, Talkata, walked towards Siris, his expression
            hardening. Although his life had been that of a slave, he had fought
            only warriors as a gladiator, never oppressing women or children. He
            had no desire to follow such a despicable order.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he couldn’t defy the command of humans. He murmured through his
            tusks in a gloomy voice, “I’m sorry. It’s your fate.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He wanted to say, “I’m truly sorry, young Elf girl. But this is also
            your destiny, and there’s nothing you can do but accept it.”
            However, the complex nuances of human language were beyond the Orc’s
            vocal capabilities. Begrudgingly clicking his tongue, Talkata drew
            his sword.
          </p>
          <p>Swoosh!</p>
          <p>Romad exclaimed in horror, “Hey, you! Don’t damage it!”</p>
          <p>“No harm will come. Talkata will just capture her.”</p>
          <p>
            The sharp longsword reflected the winter sunlight, shining brightly.
            Siris’s expression turned stern. She was confident she could defeat
            these humans, but this Orc was different. She instinctively felt
            wary of him.
          </p>
          <p>‘But I can’t back down.’</p>
          <p>
            Siris glanced at Sillan. The small boy was trembling with fear, much
            like she had been when slave hunters attacked her village when she
            was young.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, she stood in front of him, sword in hand, just like her
            parents had done for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, a smile appeared on her face. For some reason, she felt
            good.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>With a loud yell, Siris charged first.</p>

        <div

          <p>[ Chapter 35 ]</p>
          <p>
            Talkata found himself slightly taken aback. Siris’s movements were
            faster than he had anticipated.
          </p>
          <p>“Interesting!”</p>
          <p>
            However, as a veteran gladiator with more than 80 victories in the
            Zeppelin arena, Talkata’s surprise was separate from his actions.
            His longsword was already faithfully following through on its
            trajectory.
          </p>
          <p>“Slash!”</p>
          <p>
            A sharp flash left a trail in the air, striking down like lightning.
            It was a powerful blow that seemed capable of splitting the very
            essence of the spirit, making Siris twist her body in surprise. The
            moment she did, as if Talkata had anticipated this, he swung his
            sword to the side.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris groaned as she was struck on the shoulder by the blade,
            sending her flying to the side. Talkata’s attack followed
            immediately. He lifted his longsword as if to cleave through the
            earth itself. The movement was large, giving Siris room to dodge,
            but that was precisely what he had intended. With his left fist, not
            holding the sword, Talkata aimed a punch at her abdomen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris barely managed to dodge, but her legs got tangled. Only after
            stumbling backward could she regain her posture.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m sorry!”</p>
          <p>
            Apologizing, Talkata launched a relentless assault. The light of
            daggers and longswords filled the desolate winter garden. They
            exchanged dozens of blows, with Siris sweating profusely. To an
            onlooker, it might have seemed like she was defending well, but from
            the receiving end, it didn’t feel that way.
          </p>
          <p>‘So strong!’</p>
          <p>
            Talkata was only attacking with an intensity he knew she could
            defend against. She could barely defend, but finding an opportunity
            for a counterattack was impossible. Moreover, the disparity in their
            weapons was profound. It was absurd to face a longsword with only a
            dagger, and dagger technique wasn’t even her specialty.
          </p>
          <p>‘I shouldn’t have left my scimitar in the room!’</p>
          <p>
            The longsword danced around, occupying all directions. The
            trajectory of the numerous blades flying towards her was elaborate,
            yet none of them bore lethal intent. Talkata was tasked with
            capturing her without inflicting any injuries. In other words, he
            was deliberately fighting to exhaust her physically.
          </p>
          <p>
            Romad, of course, did not appreciate Talkata’s intricate strategy.
            He just kept getting annoyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What are you doing, Talkata? You incompetent fool! Can’t you
            capture a single elf female?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though he lacked skill, his voice was loud and clear. But
            Talkata paid him no mind. It seemed that failing to understand one’s
            place was a characteristic of humans. Having seen such behavior in
            humans often, he wasn’t angry, just perplexed.
          </p>
          <p>‘Looks like I’m going to miss dinner tonight.’</p>
          <p>
            Preferring to go hungry for a day rather than leaving a scar on the
            elf woman, Talkata continued his offensive carefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, Sillan was on the verge of losing his mind with
            anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>“Be careful! Siris!”</p>
          <p>“Didn’t I tell you to keep quiet!”</p>
          <p>
            Although it was not a prayer, Romad reacted sensitively to the mere
            shout. Veins bulged on Sillan’s forehead.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, I really want to give those guys a good hit…’</p>

          <p>
            Siris thought Sillan was scared. And indeed, he was shaking, but not
            out of fear. He was simply infuriated.
          </p>
          <p>‘Damn, there’s no opportunity.’</p>
          <p>
            There was no chance to use a holy spell. Since all holy spells
            required calling on the name of a deity, even the mention of
            Philanence would have Romad hurling his dagger immediately. Sillan
            had considered whispering, but since holy spells, like magic, were
            subject to the control of words, a certain volume was necessary.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            While diligently dodging, Siris finally stumbled after taking a hit
            to her abdomen. Again, Talkata managed to twist his sword at the
            last moment to hit with the flat, avoiding drawing blood. Talkata
            was indeed an experienced swordsman. Siris gritted her teeth.
          </p>
          <p>‘In that case…’</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Siris charged foolishly straight at Talkata. Surprised,
            Talkata slashed horizontally at her neck. It was a slow enough
            strike that she could have easily avoided it. However, instead of
            dodging, Siris brought her neck closer to the blade while increasing
            her spin.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>“Krugh?”</p>
          <p>
            With a bizarre scream, Talkata forcefully stopped his sword.
            Suddenly changing the offensive caused strain on his muscles. At
            that moment, Siris made a long cut across Talkata’s chest. Indeed,
            the mithril dagger easily sliced through the thick armor and wounded
            the muscle.
          </p>
          <p>“Kugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Bleeding, Talkata staggered back. He looked at the elf girl in front
            of him in confusion.
          </p>
          <p>‘What if I hadn’t twisted the trajectory?’</p>
          <p>His slender neck would have been cleanly severed.</p>
          <p>He hadn’t expected such a move.</p>
          <p>
            It would have been understandable if a novice had pulled such a
            stunt. But with that level of skill, she should have known how
            difficult it was to stop a downward strike.
          </p>
          <p>Siris smiled faintly.</p>
          <p>‘I relied on your skill for that move.’</p>
          <p>
            She was well aware that what she was doing was madness. Even now,
            her heart seemed as though it would burst from the tumult within.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, thanks to her actions, they had gained some distance. A
            momentary lull ensued. Sillan, who had been anxiously watching the
            situation, suddenly began to furiously scratch his head.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, damn it…….”</p>
          <p>With a look of determination, Sillan yelled at Siris.</p>
          <p>“Siris! Can you block a flying dagger?”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>“Yes? Maybe once…….”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, puzzled by the question, casually responded. Sillan nodded at
            her reply.
          </p>

          <p>“I’ll trust you!”</p>
          <p>And then he abruptly began to pray!</p>
          <p>“O Philanence!”</p>
          <p>
            Naturally, Romad was shocked and threw a dagger. No, the dagger was
            already flying towards Sillan by the time he shouted. The hefty
            dagger was aimed straight at Sillan’s head. If it struck, Sillan’s
            fragile head would surely be split in two.
          </p>
          <p>“Sillan!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, horrified, leapt forward and swung the dagger in an arc
            shape. She had said she could block it, but that was when she had a
            scimitar or a longsword in hand. Normally executing a sword parry
            with a longsword, she now had to do it with a dagger, and she wasn’t
            confident she could properly block it.
          </p>
          <p>Clang!</p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, the dagger collided with another dagger and flew off in
            a different direction. It was sheer luck. She was certain she
            couldn’t do it a second time.
          </p>
          <p>‘What are you doing!’</p>
          <p>
            Turning pale, Siris looked back at Sillan. He was steadfastly
            reciting his prayer, unaffected by the dagger flying towards him. He
            truly had a strong heart. After all, this was the Sillan who had
            remained unshaken even with a ghoul’s claw in front of his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>“… May you joyfully punish that damned one!”</p>
          <p>
            A prayer filled with personal feelings was completed. It was
            vocabulary that lacked the dignity expected of a clergyman. And yet,
            the holy spell was activated? Philanence, known as the goddess of
            love and beauty, must indeed have a special fondness for beautiful
            boys.
          </p>
          <p>Whoom!</p>
          <p>
            Pink maces began to float abundantly around Sillan. At the same
            time, the maces flew fiercely towards Romad and his group. Talkata,
            taken aback, swung his sword, but the formidable divine power imbued
            in those holy light maces was truly impressive. In an instant, the
            sword was knocked from Talkata’s grip, and the maces pummeled his
            entire body.
          </p>
          <p>Thud, thud, thud!</p>
          <p>“Ughhhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Even Talkata couldn’t help but scream in agony from the force
            unleashed upon him. The others had no words left to say, as they
            were all being battered and continuously screaming here and there.
            Fortunately, the place where they stood was filled with corridors
            and columns lined up in a row. Everyone desperately hid behind the
            columns, barely managing to dodge the attacks.
          </p>
          <p>In the midst of this, Sillan looked around.</p>
          <p>
            It was well known that divine power, while strong against demons and
            the undead, had its effects halved against living beings. Moreover,
            even though he was of a high rank, Sillan was a pure priest, making
            him vulnerable to attack. Since most had hidden behind the columns
            to avoid fatal blows, the enemy still outnumbered them
            significantly. This was the moment to escape.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it, where can we run?”</p>
          <p>
            Since they were surrounded by buildings on all sides, it was as if
            they were besieged. The only entrance was now occupied by the Romad
            group. At that moment, Siris suddenly kicked a longsword that
            Talkata had dropped.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            Then she executed a roundhouse kick toward the hilt of the longsword
            floating in the air. Whish! The longsword flew and embedded deeply
            into the wall of a building. Siris shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Sillan!”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            As Sillan turned his head unwittingly, he suddenly felt his body
            lift off the ground and let out a scream.
          </p>

          <p>“Uwack!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris had wrapped her arms around Sillan’s waist and was running
            towards the wall. Given that Sillan was quite light, even the
            still-young girl’s strength was enough to lift him. With that, Siris
            launched herself into the air.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah!”</p>
          <p>
            Putting all her strength into a push, she grabbed the hilt of the
            sword embedded in the wall, using the momentum to flip and turn.
            Performing a somersault in the air and reversing her body, Siris
            kicked off the sword hilt again and soared higher. Sillan groaned
            continuously as they spun in the air.
          </p>
          <p>“Eeeeh~.”</p>
          <p>
            In a single breath, they reached the second-floor balustrade, and
            Siris immediately broke through a window to enter. Talkata’s mouth
            gaped open as he watched the two flee.
          </p>
          <p>‘Fa, fast.’</p>
          <p>
            It all happened in the blink of an eye. No matter how light the
            elves were known to be, performing such acrobatic feats in this
            critical moment was astonishing. The skills of this girl named Siris
            were higher than expected. Probably, if she had been wielding a
            proper weapon instead of just a dagger, even Talkata might have been
            unable to predict the outcome of their duel.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow…”</p>
          <p>
            Romad and his party, hidden behind a pillar, were equally agape.
            They were dumbfounded by Siris’s movements, which were as swift as a
            water-struck swallow, until Romad suddenly snapped out of it and
            shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Chase, chase her!”</p>
          <p>Talkata looked back at Romad with indifferent eyes.</p>
          <p>“Romad, I ask you. How?”</p>
          <p>
            Even though he was a veteran gladiator, he couldn’t mimic that feat.
            Romad realized this too and his face showed a moment of realization,
            but he couldn’t show his mistake to a mere slave.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ugh! Ah, there are stairs behind! I meant chase her down the
            stairs!”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Romad was throwing a fit, a middle-aged man in his fifties
            quietly appeared through the entrance they had come in from. He
            looked around the garden and chuckled.
          </p>
          <p>“What, you guys failed?”</p>
          <p>“… Sir Lantas.”</p>
          <p>
            Romad looked at the middle-aged man with a face full of humiliation.
            The middle-aged man continued to sneer arrogantly.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh, idiots. You can’t even catch one elf female?”</p>
          <p>“It, it was stronger than expected…”</p>
          <p>
            Given the hierarchy, Romad couldn’t help but be frustrated
            internally while having to grovel externally. He stuttered out an
            excuse. The middle-aged man looked surprised when he noticed the
            silent orc gladiator standing behind Romad.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You couldn’t even catch her with Talkata? A rookie Slayer is that
            strong?”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was hard for him to believe that an elf Slayer could match a
            veteran orc gladiator unless she was exceptionally experienced and
            skilled, but she was supposedly just a newly sold slave.
          </p>
          <p>Curiosity sparked in the middle-aged man’s eyes as he asked.</p>
          <p>“We must make our food worth it, right? Where did she go?”</p>
          <p>“Over there.”</p>
          <p>“Is that so?”</p>
          <p>
            The middle-aged man glanced in that direction before leaping up in a
            way that couldn’t simply be described as a jump. With a light step,
            he soared like a bird, crossing the garden in a motion that seemed
            to defy the laws of gravity itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaching the second floor in a superhuman movement, the middle-aged
            man disappeared through a broken window. Despite the foul mood, the
            sight drew involuntary admiration. Romad murmured with envy.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s the power of an aura user…”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 36 ]</p>
          <p>
            Ascending to the second floor of the inn, Siris promptly led Sillan
            out into the hallway. Carried around like luggage, Sillan staggered,
            looking around dizzily. Though Siris put some distance between them
            with her elf-like agility, she knew their pursuers, no fools
            themselves, would soon follow them up the stairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan started running, suggesting, “Let’s return to our room and
            arm ourselves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris shook her head in disagreement as she ran alongside him,
            “There will be people there too.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Elvenheim trained its Slayers not only in combat skills but also in
            various situational tactics, to ensure they could adequately support
            their masters. She coldly assessed the situation and advised against
            it, “Moreover, our pursuers will likely head straight for our room.
            It’s too dangerous.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking him naive, she was surprised when Sillan shook his head,
            “I’m aware of that. But right now, it’s more important to get armed.
            With your skills, Siris, you can handle one or two guards at our
            room, right? They wouldn’t have stationed an orc gladiator there.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As they ran through the hallway, Sillan quickly added, “They’re
            going to chase us anyway. Better to delay slightly and arm ourselves
            properly than to run with just a dagger.”
          </p>
          <p>“Is that so?”</p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing his reasoning, Siris looked at Sillan anew, impressed
            by his judgment in a crisis. Though young, Sillan had far more
            experience with the world than his age suggested (in fact, he wasn’t
            that young). He understood reality better than Siris, who had lived
            her life within Elvenheim, learning theories.
          </p>
          <p>
            They immediately headed for their room, where, as expected, a man
            was guarding the entrance. As the guard started to react, Siris
            leapt up, kicked off the wall, and delivered a flying kick.
          </p>
          <p>“What? What’s this? Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            After swiftly taking down the opponent, Siris and Sillan quickly
            entered their room and locked the door. Sillan hastily grabbed his
            robe and sacred artifacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Siris opened the wardrobe, took out the clothes
            Repenhardt had bought for her, gathered some weapons, and started to
            change. She momentarily pondered whether it was appropriate to
            change in front of Sillan, considering he was also a boy, but
            brushed off the thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being pursued, they were remarkably calm. Sillan,
            astonished, exclaimed.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris! When did you have the leisure to change clothes?”</p>
          <p>“Eh? What should I do then….”</p>
          <p>
            In Elvenheim, they taught how to prepare for an ambush, but not how
            to arm oneself while fleeing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, without thinking, Siris was about to arm herself as usual.
          </p>
          <p>“Obviously, you have to grab it and run…….”</p>
          <p>
            This elf named Siris had a cold and mature look, but was
            surprisingly clumsy. Sighing, Sillan motioned for her to grab her
            things with his hand. Only then did Siris realize and hurriedly
            grabbed her weapons and jacket. During this time, Sillan offered a
            prayer.
          </p>
          <p>“O Philanence, erase our traces to protect us from danger.”</p>
          <p>He cast a holy spell to erase their tracks and prayed again.</p>
          <p>“O Philanence, let your breath dwell within us.”</p>
          <p>
            Pink particles gently rose and wrapped around their feet. With that,
            Sillan flung open the guest room window and leaped out. Siris
            exclaimed in surprise.
          </p>
          <p>“Sillan!?”</p>

          <p>
            Why did he suddenly jump, as if committing s*****e? Panicked, she
            looked out the window to see Sillan gently landing on the ground
            like a feather. The prayer Sillan had recited was for safely
            descending from high places, similar to the magic spell Feather Fall
            in effect. After landing, Sillan gestured for her to jump quickly.
          </p>
          <p>“Uff…….”</p>
          <p>
            Understanding, Siris also threw herself outside. It was late evening
            in the middle of winter, and the streets were nearly empty. Thus,
            jumping from the second floor didn’t attract much attention.
          </p>
          <p>“What do we do now?”</p>
          <p>
            With a look that said, “What kind of obvious question is that?”,
            Sillan replied.
          </p>
          <p>“We have to run.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Lantas, a man in his fifties, was leisurely walking down the
            hallway. He seemed too relaxed to be a pursuer, but he had a reason
            for his demeanor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas was a swordsman who had awakened the Aura, the great realm of
            the sword. The sensory range of an Aura user was astonishing. He
            could vividly sense the movement of all living beings within a
            radius of about 30 meters as if he were seeing them with his eyes.
            Knowing exactly where his targets were, he felt no need to hurry.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmm, what’s this? Are they planning to hide by entering a room?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Feeling the elf and boy’s presence heading towards a second-floor
            guest room, Lantas smirked. They were practically crawling into
            their room when they should be escaping the inn, truly a novice
            move. He followed the noise leisurely until his expression suddenly
            hardened.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s this?”</p>
          <p>
            The presence had vanished! The very presence that was so vividly
            felt in the second-floor room had disappeared in an instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas was flustered. He had never experienced something like this
            before. High-ranking mages or clerics could conceal their presence
            with unique spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What? Was that youngster capable of using magic to erase his
            presence like a high-ranking cleric?”
          </p>
          <p>
            He had never heard of such a thing. A look of confusion spread
            across the middle-aged man’s face. Leisurely, Lantas vanished with a
            swoosh, leaving only the sound of air in his wake. In an instant, he
            had crossed the corridor, opened the door to the room, and surveyed
            the interior. The room was empty, and the window was wide open,
            letting in the chilly winter wind.
          </p>
          <p>“This, this is…”</p>
          <p>
            His confident expression twisted. He hadn’t expected the youngsters
            to have such tricks up their sleeves.
          </p>
          <p>
            On a whim, he cut off his mana perception and focused his aura on
            his hearing, in case the person had erased their presence and was
            hiding in the room. There were those who believed in the proverb,
            “The darkest place is under the candlestick,” and used such methods
            to evade their pursuers.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how well one hides and holds their breath, the sound of a
            beating heart cannot be concealed. No magic or divine spell could
            allow someone to live without the beat of their heart. That’s why he
            listened carefully…
          </p>
          <p>“Damn, they must have escaped outside.”</p>
          <p>
            The room was definitely empty. At that moment, Romad and his
            subordinates belatedly entered the room. They had just caught up
            with Lantas after hastily climbing the stairs and rushing through
            the corridors.
          </p>
          <p>“Where are they, Sir Lantas?”</p>
          <p>
            Romad looked around and asked. His tone was casual, but to Lantas,
            it sounded almost like a rebuke, causing him to furrow his brows
            even more.
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t tell me… you’ve lost them?”</p>

          <p>“Quiet! They must be around here somewhere. Spread out!”</p>
          <p>
            Lantas shouted and walked towards the window. He had only followed
            to stretch his legs and show off, but now he was genuinely heated.
            He leapt out of the window like a bird.
          </p>
          <p>
            The city of Zeppelin was enveloped in darkness, with the sun already
            set and the moon hidden, making the city corners especially dark.
          </p>
          <p>
            As befitting a commercial city, the main streets were bright with
            streetlights and the glow from shops, but just a few steps into the
            alleys plunged one into pitch darkness.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that darkness, two people were carefully making their way. Sillan
            and Siris had escaped from the “Golden Rest” and were using the
            shadows to navigate through the alleys, moving away from the inn.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh, I can’t see.”</p>
          <p>“This way.”</p>
          <p>“Mm-hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, with her night vision, could somewhat make out the
            surroundings, but Sillan was practically blind in the darkness.
            Stumbling over obstacles, he relied solely on Siris’s hand to guide
            him.
          </p>
          <p>“It seems like there’s no one around.”</p>
          <p>
            Even if Romad’s party wasn’t there, the dark alleyway was a den of
            crime in its own right. The woman, gripping a scimitar, kept a
            vigilant watch around her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If there were many eyes watching, they wouldn’t dare to attack
            rashly. Maybe it’s better to go out to the streets?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris made a sensible suggestion, as she had learned in Elvenheim.
            It seemed even those who acted recklessly were wary of the public
            eye. Hadn’t the inn also refrained from moving guests around without
            cause?
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Sillan, who knew the reality, rejected that suggestion.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s useless. We need to avoid drawing any attention as much as
            possible.”
          </p>
          <p>“Why?”</p>
          <p>
            “Those guys, they’ll surely claim they’re here to capture escaped
            slaves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            From the perspective of a passerby, there would be no way to tell if
            Siris was an escaped slave or if someone was trying to unlawfully
            take someone else’s slave. It was obvious everyone would just mind
            their own business.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Instead, we would only end up revealing our location. Right now,
            avoiding attention is crucial.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Clicking his tongue, Sillan groped through the darkness again.
            Suddenly, a sigh escaped him.
          </p>
          <p>“Phew…”</p>
          <p>
            Although he had wandered the world, he had mainly traveled around
            the Vasily Kingdom. The Vasily Kingdom, strong in the teachings of
            the Philanence Order, had Philanence temples everywhere. Back then,
            Sillan was also part of the power class, and thus could deal with
            injustices as much as he needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, once he became a pilgrim and left the Vasily Kingdom, he
            painfully realized how harsh the world could be. He understood why
            so many pilgrims ended up dying. He even thought of returning to his
            comfortable and peaceful order.
          </p>
          <p>‘But if I give up here…’</p>
          <p>
            Sillan clenched his teeth, thinking of ‘her’ who was waiting in the
            order. ‘She’ was the main reason he had chosen the path of a
            pilgrim. If he returned now, he would be caught by ‘her’ again.
          </p>

          <p>He didn’t want that.</p>
          <p>
            ‘I’d rather wander the world in danger! I won’t return until I’ve
            become a manly man!’
          </p>
          <p>
            With that resolution, Sillan clenched his fists tightly. Siris
            tilted her head, puzzled.
          </p>
          <p>‘……?’</p>
          <p>
            After wandering the alleyways for quite some time, they finally came
            upon a somewhat brighter place. Though still dark, the area had
            relatively affluent houses, and light leaked from second-story
            windows even at night.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the outlines of objects became visible, Sillan leaned against a
            wall, relieved. Walking with his eyes closed was more mentally
            draining than he had imagined. Catching his breath, Sillan grumbled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah! If only Repenhardt were here, we wouldn’t have any problems!
            Where on earth is that guy wandering off to?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Having an Aura wielder by one’s side meant there was nothing to
            fear. No matter how many of those riffraff swarmed in, or even if an
            orc gladiator invaded with an army, it posed no problem at all.
          </p>
          <p>“Anyway, we must meet up with Mr. Repenhardt, ah…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris tilted her head, puzzled. The Repenhardt she had seen was
            nothing more than a bizarre young man lost in his role-play, large
            in stature. Yet, the high priest Sillan showed such deep trust in
            him.
          </p>
          <p>“Is Repenhardt that strong?”</p>
          <p>‘Ah, Siris doesn’t know, of course.’</p>
          <p>
            Sillan was just about to reveal that Repenhardt was an Aura user
            when Siris changed the subject first.
          </p>
          <p>“We still need to meet up, right?”</p>
          <p>
            “Indeed. No matter how you look at it, those guys are underlings of
            the ruling powers; clashing with them would just be a headache.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With Repenhardt’s strength, the current problem seemed like it could
            easily be solved with his fists. However, even so, if those in power
            push with their might, an individual can hardly cope. Being part of
            the ruling class himself, Sillan knew this all too well.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best option seemed to be meeting Repenhardt and getting out of
            Zeppelin in any way possible. It might feel dirty to flee without
            committing a crime, but realistically, what other choice was there?
          </p>
          <p>
            “Then, let’s send someone with a letter and decide on a place to
            meet.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a sensible suggestion, but Sillan shook his head again this
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Given the nature of this place, they’re likely to run straight to
            those guys with that letter.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan already harbored deep mistrust for this nonsensical country
            called the Chatan Principality. It wasn’t exactly prejudice. The
            city of Zeppelin was indeed full of such scoundrels.
          </p>
          <p>“Is there another way then?”</p>
          <p>
            Having every suggestion rejected, Siris’s tone turned cold, slightly
            annoyed. Of course, the oblivious Sillan still didn’t catch on.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a moment of contemplation, Sillan seemed to have thought of
            something, albeit reluctantly.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah! There is a way…”</p>
          <p>
            The look on his face showed he wasn’t too pleased with the idea he
            had in mind.
          </p>
          <p>Sighing, Sillan stood up and began to pray quietly.</p>
          <p>
            “Oh Philanence, in your merciful protection, allow the threads of
            fate so that a sorrowful parting may turn into a joyful meeting…”
          </p>
          <p>
            The prayer was unusually long and remarkably normal. Fascinated,
            Siris watched Sillan. After praying to the goddess, Sillan closed
            his eyes and stood silently for a moment. Suddenly, he shuddered.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, it’s done…”</p>
          <p>His expression was less than thrilled for a successful prayer.</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 37 ]</p>
          <p>
            Sillan had cast a divine spell known as the ‘Intersection of Fate.’
          </p>
          <p>Love turns chance into destiny.</p>
          <p>
            A chance encounter becomes a destined one through love. A man meets
            a woman and says that among the countless men and women on the
            continent, their meeting is like a miraculous coincidence, a destiny
            in itself. Though it may seem like a mere coincidence, when blessed
            by Philanence, it becomes destiny.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan murmured with his eyes closed, “Yes, I think I know which way
            to go.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The ‘Intersection of Fate’ was a spell with the power to guide one
            through coincidence to a destined encounter they must meet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally used to match compatible couples, the spell could also
            reunite separated comrades when interpreted more broadly.
          </p>
          <p>
            The issue was that both Repenhardt and Sillan were men, which made
            them feel quite uncomfortable about it.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, I didn’t want to use it in this way…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan scratched his head. Philanence’s love was indeed broad, not
            discriminating against age, gender, or any other factor. Her divine
            generosity even accepted gay and lesbian couples. Of course, being a
            goddess of beauty, the spell wouldn’t activate for a couple that
            looked odd to her, but this time, it seemed she was satisfied and
            let it pass.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a way, it was like cheating the goddess, so Sillan did not want
            to use this spell unless absolutely necessary.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go, Siris.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan started walking with a drained expression. Once the spell was
            activated, they just needed to walk as they pleased, and chance
            would help them encounter Repenhardt fatefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, knowing their destination made them feel better. The two
            relaxed and started talking softly.
          </p>
          <p>“But Siris, you’re incredibly strong, aren’t you?”</p>
          <p>“Because I’m a Slayer.”</p>
          <p>
            “No, it’s not just that. I’ve seen another Slayer named Relsia, but
            Siris seems beyond that.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I just worked a bit harder than others. But you, Sillan, are an
            exceptionally high-ranking priest for your age, aren’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, that’s a bit funny………….”</p>
          <p>
            As they conversed, Sillan felt a strange sentiment. She expressed
            his thoughts clearly, listened seriously to the other’s opinions,
            and sometimes harbored doubts. Despite being an elf, a slave race,
            it was as if he was talking to a human.
          </p>
          <p>‘Is Siris an exception?’</p>
          <p>
            However, Sillan had never had such a serious conversation with other
            elves before. While elf slaves were considered valuable, he did have
            a few encounters with them. But each time, it was merely to issue
            commands and listen to their responses. Without a point of
            comparison, he couldn’t tell if this was unusual or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Sillan felt an absence of desire to proceed further. As he
            stopped walking, Siris looked around and asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Is this the place?”</p>
          <p>
            It was a small square with a communal well, enclosed on all sides by
            the rear walls of buildings and only a few small back doors in sight
            – a dimly lit place.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes. This is where we were pointed to.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan confidently replied. Blessed with the love of the goddess and
            possessing a strong faith in her, Sillan could summon divine spells
            with even the strangest of prayers. As such, he was certain this
            place was ‘the point where fate intersects.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, it wasn’t long before they sensed someone approaching from
            across the square. Sillan smiled broadly at the sound of footsteps.
          </p>

          <p>“Ah? Is that Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>
            However, Siris did not return the smile. Instead, she drew her
            scimitar. Sillan turned around in surprise.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris?”</p>
          <p>“It’s not Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            Taking a stance, Siris hardened her expression. She already
            remembered the sound of Repenhardt’s footsteps. It wasn’t because he
            was her master; elf hearing was so acute that they couldn’t help but
            memorize the distinct sounds of people’s steps, even if they didn’t
            want to.
          </p>
          <p>
            A moment later, a man emerged from the dim darkness. Sillan’s
            expression also hardened. The man who appeared was a middle-aged man
            in his fifties with a sword at his waist.
          </p>
          <p>
            The middle-aged man, Lantas, coldly smiled as he glared at Siris and
            Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>“Found you, you kids.”</p>
          <p>
            “You’ve been running around quite a bit. Made me run for the first
            time in a while.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas taunted them as he looked from one to the other. Then, he
            took out a small pouch from his waist.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, I should call the others too.”</p>
          <p>
            With a flick of his thumb, the pouch launched into the air as if
            shot from a sling. A sinister spark of fire burst in the sky before
            dying down – it contained an alchemical firework concoction.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris grimaced as she glared at Lantas. Their location had been
            revealed by the spark. They needed to leave this place immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Glancing around at the alleyway connected to the square, Siris’s
            action made Lantas smirk.
          </p>
          <p>“Thinking of running away? I’d advise against it.”</p>
          <p>
            Indeed, turning one’s back on an enemy was not recommended. With
            your back turned, you couldn’t see what might be coming at you.
            Escape was only a viable option after having disrupted the enemy.
          </p>
          <p>Siris drew her scimitar.</p>
          <p>
            There was no time to waste. She had to cut down the enemy before her
            and escape from this place immediately!
          </p>
          <p>“Haah!”</p>
          <p>
            She sprinted, repeatedly kicking off the ground with her scimitar
            trailing behind her. In a blink, Siris closed a distance of over ten
            meters and raised her sword to strike. The sudden ambush caught her
            opponent off guard, leaving them staring blankly at the incoming
            blade.
          </p>
          <p>
            A silver flash marked a long cut from Lantas’s side to his shoulder.
            At that moment, Siris was certain.
          </p>
          <p>‘I cut him!’</p>
          <p>
            But then, just when she thought she had succeeded, the enemy
            vanished before her eyes. What she had struck was merely an
            afterimage. A voice tinged with amusement came from behind her.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re faster than I thought.”</p>
          <p>‘What?!’</p>
          <p>
            Startled, Siris spun around, swinging her scimitar back. But Lantas
            was already gone. As she widened her eyes in shock, checking the
            empty space behind her, the voice reached her ears again.
          </p>
          <p>“Not bad for a new Slayer, huh?”</p>

          <p>“Yikes!”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Lantas was behind her, resting his chin on her shoulder
            and murmuring smugly. Goosebumps rose on her skin as Siris tried to
            stab him with the blade under her arm, but it was futile. The moment
            she lashed out with her sword, Lantas had already moved out of her
            sight to somewhere else entirely.
          </p>
          <p>“Seems like you’ve got some talent.”</p>
          <p>“Haah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a shout, she attempted a more complex swordplay, stabbing and
            then immediately turning to unleash a series of rapid strikes. She
            aimed where she predicted her opponent would dodge, but still
            couldn’t so much as graze Lantas’s clothes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You seem to have put in a lot of effort. Quite unusual for a
            slave.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas was like a mirage, circling around Siris with an utterly
            relaxed expression, completely devoid of any tension.
          </p>
          <p>“Grrr!”</p>
          <p>Siris clenched her teeth in humiliation.</p>
          <p>
            She was a Slayer of a different caliber from the others in
            Elvenheim. Why else would Elvenheim persistently try to train Siris,
            who notoriously never listened? Even when faced with absurdly
            disadvantageous situations, fighting off a dozen Slayer candidates
            with nothing but a stick, she never backed down. If only she had
            been more compliant, she might have become the strongest Slayer in
            history, which is why Elvenheim couldn’t give up on her. Though, in
            the end, they failed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris was confident she could defeat not only the other Slayers, but
            also the sword instructors and the orc gladiator guards as soon as
            she wielded a sword. Her only setback against Talkata was due to
            being unaccustomed to wielding just a dagger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though she was now fully armed and wielding a familiar weapon,
            she found herself being toyed with by her opponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even more astonishing was that her opponent had not even drawn his
            sword yet!
          </p>
          <p>‘Who on Earth is this man!?’</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Sillan watched the duel with a surprised expression.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Good heavens! How could such a skilled person be involved in this?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris’s rapid attacks were being effortlessly dodged by the
            middle-aged man. It was not just simple evasion; he was skillfully
            avoiding the blade’s edge while maintaining distance. Such a feat
            could not be possible without a significant difference in skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If he’s reached such a level, he must certainly be a well-known
            knight or swordsman, yet he’s involved in this sordid affair?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan could not just stand by and watch. He began to recite a
            prayer, drawing upon his divine power.
          </p>
          <p>“O Philanence…”</p>
          <p>
            As he quietly recited the prayer, Sillan kept an eye on Lantas,
            ready to abandon the prayer and hide behind the well if any daggers
            were thrown his way. Surprisingly, there was no need. Reassured,
            Sillan continued his prayer.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Grant your servant the courage of a lion. Let her arms, wielding
            the sword, be endowed with the strength of giants, let her eyes be
            fierce like an eagle’s, and her legs as sturdy as a bull’s, to
            strike down her enemies!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Divine power surged into Siris, enveloping her entire body. Her
            scimitar glowed with a pink light. It was the Holy Strike, blessed
            by Philanence.
          </p>
          <p>“What is this?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris trembled in awe at the incredible power and authority wrapping
            around her. Sillan had boosted her strength, defense, speed,
            agility, and even her reflexes to overflowing levels. Even Lantas
            appeared genuinely surprised this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            “How? Casting so many holy spells at once? Was he a bishop-level
            cleric at his age?”
          </p>
          <p>Sillan exclaimed proudly.</p>
          <p>
            “I was quite renowned in the southern parts of Vasily! Siris! Finish
            him off!”
          </p>

          <p>“Yes, Sillan!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris lunged forward, launching a slashing attack. With a speed
            unlike before, Lantas quickly retreated. The situation was no longer
            one where he could afford to casually circle around.
          </p>
          <p>“Ha!”</p>
          <p>
            The scimitar, imbued with Philanence’s sacred light, left a
            sparkling pink trail in the air. While Repenhardt had been a sorry
            sight, the situation seemed quite fitting for a beautiful elf like
            Siris. Of course, Siris paid it no mind.
          </p>
          <p>“Ha!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris continued to press Lantas. The movements of her once-illusory
            opponent were now clearly visible. The fatigue from moments ago
            vanished as if it were a lie, with her limbs moving freely in an
            unbelievable manner.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ugh!’</p>
          <p>
            Lantas was taken aback. Pink blades relentlessly targeted his vital
            spots, flying towards him with such precision that there was no time
            to evade. Eventually, he too drew his sword. The clash of blades
            rang out, a loud metallic noise echoing as they exchanged blows
            without pause. The color of steel was overlaid with a hue of pink,
            as the fierce light of the swords mercilessly ravaged the clearing.
          </p>
          <p>‘This is ridiculous…’</p>
          <p>
            Lantas clicked his tongue at Siris’s movements, which seemed
            possessed. The opponent who he had been merely toying with until a
            moment ago had transformed so drastically, likely due to receiving a
            divine spell. It proved how significant the protection of a powerful
            cleric could be in battle. It left a bitter taste in his mouth.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan was elated.</p>
          <p>“Well done, Siris!”</p>
          <p>Suddenly, Lantas scowled.</p>
          <p>“Ah, getting all lively just from playing around a bit!”</p>
          <p>
            Irritably, he lowered his sword. As Siris was about to continue her
            attack, her pupils filled with a red flash. Her mithril scimitar
            broke in two, and she was sent flying backward as if hit by a
            carriage.
          </p>
          <p>“Aargh!”</p>
          <p>Sillan froze in his tracks.</p>
          <p>“What…?”</p>
          <p>
            It had been a single strike. Though he thought they were evenly
            matched, the duel had been decided by that one blow. Sillan looked
            at Lantas with a shocked expression.
          </p>
          <p>Lantas’s sword was shining with a crimson glow.</p>
          <p>“An Aura user?”</p>
          <p>“Tch, to use Aura against mere Slayers…”</p>
          <p>
            Lantas twisted his lips, glaring at them with displeasure. Sillan
            hurriedly rushed to Siris, who had fallen.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you okay, Siris?”</p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris groaned as she got up. Though she staggered, it seemed she was
            not seriously hurt. Thanks to Sillan’s divine protection, most of
            the impact was absorbed, but as a consequence, all the powerful
            protections he had painstakingly accumulated were now gone.
          </p>
          <p>“Why would an Aura user be in such a place…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan murmured in disbelief while supporting Siris. An awakened
            Aura user could live a respected life anywhere in the world. It was
            absurd for someone of such power to be deployed on a mere mission to
            capture elf slaves. It was like using a dragon’s breath to boil
            soup.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, one after another, figures began to emerge through the alleys
            around the clearing. Romad and his party had arrived late to the
            location upon receiving a signal. After Romad had instructed Talkata
            to take the fallen comrades back home, he had continued to search
            the streets with the remaining members. Since Lantas had intervened,
            there was no longer a need for the power of an orc gladiator.
          </p>
          <p>Seeing Sillan and Siris, Romad shouted joyfully.</p>
          <p>“You’ve caught them, Sir Lantas!”</p>
          <p>
            Hearing that name, Sillan realized the identity of the middle-aged
            man.
          </p>
          <p>‘That’s Lantas? The filthy perverted knight?’</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 38 ]</p>
          <p>Lantas von Kalpanard.</p>
          <p>
            Originally, he was a renowned knight of the Teikan Kingdom, which is
            adjacent to the Vasily Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up as a descendant of a noble family and walking the path of
            a knight, he demonstrated an astonishing feat of awakening his Aura
            in his late thirties, thanks to his natural talent, excellent
            teaching, and personal efforts. The entire Teikan Kingdom celebrated
            the birth of a new Aura wielder.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Lantas had a vile hobby he could not disclose to others. He
            was a pedophile who felt sexual desire only towards children who had
            not yet matured.
          </p>
          <p>
            When he was young, he dedicated himself to martial arts and, wary of
            others’ eyes, kept his true nature hidden. But after becoming an
            Aura wielder and being in a position incomparable to others, his
            true nature gradually began to reveal itself. Initially, Lantas
            vented his sexual desires by purchasing young elves. Over time, his
            depravity escalated, starting with the kidnapping and murder of
            children from the capital, and later, even reaching out to the young
            daughters of nobles.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the saying goes, a long tail gets stepped on, and a righteous
            knight, suspecting something was amiss, eventually exposed his vile
            crimes to the world. The capital’s knight order stormed Lantas’s
            mansion and ground their teeth at the horrors they found in the
            basement. There lay a mountain of children’s bodies, violated at a
            young age.
          </p>
          <p>
            The pride of the Teikan Kingdom became its most hideous shame.
            Naturally, the entire kingdom rose to capture him. However, as an
            Aura wielder, he was not easily caught. After slaughtering hundreds,
            he eventually fled the Teikan Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            His notoriety spread beyond the Teikan Kingdom to the Vasily
            Kingdom. Sillan, too, was warned as a child not to wander at night
            carelessly, lest Lantas take him away.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan shouted in anger.</p>
          <p>
            “This filthy monster! Was he hiding in the Principality of Chatan!”
          </p>
          <p>Lantas glanced at Sillan and smiled slyly.</p>
          <p>“Oh? You know of me?”</p>
          <p>
            “To think an Aura wielder would involve himself in such filthy acts,
            you really are as dirty as the rumors say!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the contempt-filled outcry, Lantas was unbothered. If he
            were someone so sensitive, he would not have committed the sin of
            murdering children.
          </p>
          <p>Lantas shrugged.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, I’m in a position where I have to earn a salary, after all.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Having fled the Teikan Kingdom, he was chased and ended up in the
            Principality of Chatan. No country on the continent wanted to harbor
            such a vile rapist. However, the Rolpein Trading Company was
            different. Seeing the value of an Aura wielder purely in monetary
            terms, the Rolpein Trading Company generously overlooked a minor(?)
            infamy like his.
          </p>
          <p>
            And here, Lantas was able to enjoy a blissful sexual life by
            brutally exploiting young slaves. As a wielder of Aura, his salary
            was substantial, and given that Zeppelin was the heartland of the
            slave industry, he could purchase slaves at cost, which afforded him
            considerable economic leeway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever he desired a change, it was easy to kill transient peddlers
            and kidnap their children. Unlike in the Teikan Kingdom, the
            disappearance of a person or two went unnoticed in this place
            teeming with transient populations. It was paradise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Lantas’ existence was a significant boon for the Rolpein
            Trading Company as well. Engaged in all manners of unsavory
            activities behind the scenes, the company often found itself in
            situations requiring the use of force. And an Aura wielder
            represented the pinnacle of that force. Lantas’ contributions were
            significant in the company becoming the second-largest trading
            company in the Chatan Principality within ten years. The top trading
            company, the Chatan Trading Company, was directly managed by the
            royal family of the country, making it virtually unrivaled.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mutual benefits ensured that Lantas was well-treated. Although
            the Teikan Kingdom sent pursuers after him, the Rolpein Trading
            Company’s protection meant he had no worries about being attacked in
            his sleep. Thus, Lantas had become bold enough to discard his alias
            and use his real name.
          </p>
          <p>“The Goddess will not forgive you!”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan cried out in anger, clasping his hands together. He aimed to
            pour all his holy power into Siris, enhancing her strength. As a
            priest, he had almost no direct combat capabilities. However, he was
            confident in his healing and amplifying powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If I pour all the holy power I have, I can give Siris the strength
            to fight against an Aura wielder for a short time!’
          </p>
          <p>
            The downside was that both would be in agony for days afterward, but
            it was still better than being captured. Just as Sillan was about to
            invoke the name of the Goddess.
          </p>

          <p>“Philanence…”</p>
          <p>“Oops! Can’t let you do that!”</p>
          <p>
            Lantas reacted swiftly, slicing through the air with his sword.
            Already on edge due to Sillan’s holy power, he was prepared. A spray
            of red Aura scattered, sending darts of crimson light that embedded
            themselves in Siris and Sillan’s limbs.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>“Ahh!”</p>
          <p>
            Both fell, bleeding from their limbs. Lantas had severed the tendons
            in their arms and legs with blades of Aura. As someone who preyed on
            children, his precision was terrifyingly sharp.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s see what happens when you let a high priest speak out of
            turn.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas spun his sword, smirking mockingly. Romad fretted beside him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, Lord Lantas! What if you cause injuries! Lord Teriq will be
            furious!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Quiet, just bring a cleric to heal them. Why are you so
            inflexible?”
          </p>
          <p>Lantas clicked his tongue and gestured.</p>
          <p>“Go tie them up.”</p>
          <p>
            The group led by Romad started approaching with a rope in hand.
            Siris tried to overcome her pain and stand up, but she could only
            twitch. Her willpower was indeed astonishing, but fundamentally,
            since the tendons were cut, this wasn’t a problem that could be
            solved with grit alone.
          </p>
          <p>Seeing this, Sillan felt sorry for her.</p>
          <p>“S-Siris! What should we do, uh…”</p>
          <p>
            His mouth was fine, so he could pray, but that would immediately
            bring another swing of the blade. However, he couldn’t let Siris be
            taken away like this.
          </p>
          <p>‘What to do, what to do, what to do?’</p>
          <p>
            Although they were both down, Sillan was only worried about Siris’s
            well-being. Well, since those guys were after Siris and Sillan was
            just to be abandoned, it was natural he wasn’t worried about
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            But then, the situation started to take a weird turn. Lantas, who
            had been looking indifferently at the fallen Sillan, suddenly licked
            his lips.
          </p>
          <p>“Come to think of it, you’re quite a pretty one.”</p>
          <p>
            It was dark, so he hadn’t noticed before, but now that he saw her,
            she was extremely beautiful. She was a bit older than his taste, but
            still looked young and was very beautiful. Lantas shouted to Romad.
          </p>
          <p>“Romad, let’s take this one too.”</p>
          <p>And then, he rubbed his chin, muttering with a sinister face.</p>
          <p>
            “If only you were a bit younger, it would be perfect, but well, this
            one has its own flavor…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing the ominous muttering of Lantas, Sillan’s complexion turned
            pale.
          </p>
          <p>‘Flavor? What flavor?’</p>

          <p>
            He knew very well what kind of man Lantas was. This was no time to
            worry about Siris!
          </p>
          <p>“W-Wait a minute! I’m a man!”</p>
          <p>Sillan’s desperate appeal briefly disappointed Lantas.</p>
          <p>“Is that so?”</p>
          <p>But he quickly regained his composure.</p>
          <p>“Hmm, but that has its own unique appeal…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan was horrified by Lantas’s unexpected reaction. Now that he
            thought about it, he had heard Lantas didn’t care about age, but he
            hadn’t heard anything about him caring about gender.
          </p>
          <p>A man over fifty was looking at him, sending a wrinkled smile.</p>
          <p>“Huhuhu, I’ll cherish you.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan turned pale at the sight of Lantas, a knight, even
            considering raping a man, which was utterly abhorrent.
          </p>
          <p>“Eek!”</p>
          <p>
            Romad’s group made a disdainful expression that said, ‘Here he goes
            again.’ Anxiety caused Sillan’s golden eyes to shake wildly. No,
            Goddess. I prayed to meet Mr. Repenhardt, so why did you let me meet
            such a pervert? Did I pray incorrectly? But you usually respond
            promptly even when I roughly chant my prayers.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Gasp! Could it be that Philanence has chosen this perverted old man
            as my destined partner? Is that it, possibly?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan was so engulfed in panic that for a moment, even absurd
            thoughts crossed his mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Two men approached, each holding a rope in their hand. With her
            tendons cut, no matter how fearsome a Slayer she might be, there was
            no way she could resist. Confident of this, they were about to reach
            out to her.
          </p>
          <p>Then, a flash of sword light sliced through one man’s arm.</p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            The men retreated in shock, startled, thinking that Siris had risen.
            But it wasn’t Siris who had gotten up.
          </p>
          <p>It was Sillan.</p>
          <p>“Don’t make me laugh…”</p>
          <p>
            The frail boy was glaring at the men with terrifying eyes, holding a
            silver dagger in one hand. Blood dripped down the mithril blade.
            Lantas’s eyes widened in disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            Even he, who had experienced all manner of battles, had never
            encountered such a situation. How could Sillan have risen in just a
            few minutes? Without a prayer, it was impossible to use healing
            magic.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s that? Some kind of zombie?”</p>
          <p>
            It was so astonishing that it even brought ludicrous thoughts to
            mind. If so, this would be the most vibrant, beautiful, and fragile
            zombie in the world.
          </p>
          <p>“… You’ll never lay a hand on my body!”</p>

          <p>
            Holding the dagger, Sillan’s eyes blazed. His golden eyes, filled
            with bloodshot rage, had turned red. The fierce look made the men
            involuntarily step back.
          </p>
          <p>That’s when it happened.</p>
          <p>Vrooom!</p>
          <p>
            A whirlwind blew. At the same time, something sliced through the
            wind, flying in. The figures of the two men standing in front of
            Sillan vanished in an instant. Then, an explosion sounded to the
            side.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            It was a rare sight, as if the people blocking his view had
            teleported away. Sillan blankly turned his head to the side.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            On the building surrounding the clearing, a large wooden plank was
            embedded in the outer wall. It seemed to have been a house door,
            given the doorknob and metal-trimmed edges. And between the door and
            the wall, something crimson was squished.
          </p>
          <p>For a moment, Sillan felt nauseated.</p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            It was a mass of blood and flesh! The current state of the men who
            had been alive just moments ago!
          </p>
          <p>
            Romad and his group were all frozen stiff. It was a horrifying
            method of killing they had never seen before. Romad turned towards
            the direction from which the door had flown.
          </p>
          <p>
            A young man with dark brown hair and a robust physique was standing
            with his right hand stretched forward, staring at the clearing with
            a chilling murderous intent, as if it emanated from hell itself. The
            young man spoke.
          </p>
          <p>“Found you, you bastards…”</p>
          <p>
            Interrupting his retching, Sillan shouted with a look of relief.
          </p>
          <p>“Repenhardt!”</p>
          <p>‘What is it with that guy…’</p>
          <p>
            Lantas looked utterly bewildered as he gazed at Repenhardt. On the
            surface, Repenhardt seemed just a big young man, but as an aura
            wielder, Lantas could distinctly feel the mountainous momentum
            swirling around his entire body.
          </p>
          <p>‘What’s with this tremendous energy?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt approached with a murderous look, striding forward
            confidently. No one dared block his path. Reaching Siris and Sillan,
            his eyes sparked with flames as he looked down at the fallen Siris.
            Trying to suppress his excitement, he expressed his gratitude to
            Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you for protecting Siris.”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Sillan’s face turned red. In reality, it was Siris who had
            protected Sillan, but Repenhardt, having seen only the end, could
            easily be mistaken. Moreover, his last-minute intervention was due
            to sensing a serious crisis, not specifically out of concern for
            Siris.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, yes. Well…”</p>
          <p>
            Stammering, Sillan then approached the fallen Siris and performed a
            healing spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            “O Philanence, raise your lamb once more and take away her wounds.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this time, Repenhardt glared sternly at the Romad party.
          </p>
          <p>
            Returning to the inn, Repenhardt had no clue about the situation.
            The empty room, the missing belongings of Sillan and Siris, and the
            open window made him naively think, ‘Perhaps the kids just got bored
            and went out to play.’
          </p>
          <p>
            He only realized something was wrong due to the innkeeper’s
            behavior. Sensing something off with the innkeeper’s reluctant
            demeanor, he pressed the man for answers. Faced with Repenhardt’s
            fist that could crush the inn’s pillars, the innkeeper confessed
            everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            A group had come, bribed him, emptied the inn, and then targeted
            Siris and Sillan during the opportunity. Repenhardt immediately
            rushed out of the inn.
          </p>
          <p>
            With anger, he scoured the streets for Siris. He was dismayed by his
            own foolishness. He wasn’t some inexperienced youth in his twenties.
            Yet, knowing there were threats, he had left her side? He couldn’t
            believe it. How had he failed to grasp the situation?
          </p>
          <p>
            Filled with regret, he combed through the streets of Zeppelin.
            Suddenly, in an alley deep within the streets, he felt a powerful
            aura. Hoping it might be Siris, he ran towards it and found her
            collapsed, with two men approaching Sillan. In his haste, he grabbed
            anything he could and threw it. Only after throwing did he realize
            it was someone’s house door.
          </p>
          <p>“How dare you target Siris…”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 39 ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s words, filled with murderous intent, left Romad and his
            companions frozen in place. It was no longer the voice of a human,
            but rather the growling of a beast that had lost its offspring. Like
            a frog paralyzed before a snake, they found themselves unable to
            move, overwhelmed by his presence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, even in his heightened state of excitement, Repenhardt did not
            act rashly. The presence of the sword-wielding middle-aged man
            beside Romad’s group was the reason.
          </p>
          <p>‘He is strong,’ Repenhardt thought.</p>
          <p>
            It was evident at a glance. Was this a unique sense possessed by
            martial artists? For some unknown reason, he was certain of the
            man’s strength, which prevented him from acting recklessly despite
            his anger reaching its peak.
          </p>
          <p>Upon seeing Repenhardt, Romad exclaimed in an overexcited tone.</p>
          <p>
            “Lantas, sir, that’s the guy! He’s the one who’s the master of the
            Slayer.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Without even turning his head, Lantas replied with a disgusted
            expression.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re such a fool…”</p>
          <p>
            How could he inform him that the owner was a novice! Just by looking
            at him, all his senses were sounding alarms! If Lantas, an aura
            user, could not gauge his opponent’s strength, it implied that the
            opponent was at least an aura user as well.
          </p>
          <p>‘But how could he be so young?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt did not seem to be older than in his twenties. Given his
            size, one might guess late twenties, but his face looked remarkably
            young, possibly early twenties. Either way, it was definitely not
            the age to possess such tremendous energy.
          </p>
          <p>‘Could he be an incredible case of looking young?’</p>
          <p>
            The thought that his face was youthful but he might actually be
            middle-aged crossed his mind. Of course, it was a preposterous idea.
            Not even daily skincare at the renowned Philanence Aesthetic Salon
            could achieve that look. However, for Lantas, the miracle working
            capabilities of Philanence’s beauty skills were more believable than
            the existence of a twenty-something aura awakener.
          </p>
          <p>‘He must be at least in his late thirties.’</p>
          <p>
            That was around the time he had awakened his aura. Lantas drew his
            sword with a serious expression.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s been a while since I’ve met a truly strong opponent.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt sneered coldly.</p>
          <p>
            “A perverted old man who preys on children is pretending to be a
            knight.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment he heard the name Lantas, Repenhardt knew. He knew why
            such a notorious aura user was acting this way here. Lantas’s infamy
            was well-known, even to Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas’s face twisted with humiliation at his opponent’s mockery.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>
            While he could ignore Sillan’s taunts, being ridiculed by a fellow
            martial artist, especially a strong one, felt completely different.
            Grinding his teeth in frustration, Lantas raised his sword.
          </p>

          <p>“This bastard…”</p>
          <p>A crimson aura sinisterly flowed down the blade of Lantas.</p>
          <p>
            “Why? Are you heated because you got cursed at? Or maybe it’s your
            ‘preference’, so ‘please respect it’~?” he taunted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, too, clenched his fists, adopting a stance. A golden
            aura began to emanate, filling his hands and burning like flames.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was no more conversation. Both silently sized up each other.
          </p>
          <p>“Whoosh!”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Repenhardt kicked off the ground, propelling himself
            forward. Lantas charged as well, his sword ready. A dazzling golden
            light clashed with the red, emitting a loud explosion.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The collision of red and gold illuminated the night sky over
            Zeppelin, spreading waves of light in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            A red sword dance swirled around, cutting through the air and
            leaving behind a curtain of crimson, like silk.
          </p>
          <p>
            This curtain was torn apart by a golden light. Each punch that flew
            was filled with terrifying force, easily piercing through the aura’s
            veil and firing off like cannon shots.
          </p>
          <p>“Eiit!”</p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt and Lantas exchanged dozens of blows, their movements
            beyond human understanding. The red blade continuously danced
            through the air, while punches and kicks violently shook the void,
            yet neither could land a hit on the other’s body. Instead, the
            clashing auras caused destruction around them.
          </p>
          <p>
            With every attack and dodge, the colliding auras spread waves of
            light in all directions. Wherever the waves reached, stone pavements
            overturned, walls crumbled, and water barrels shattered, sending
            droplets scattering everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>“Shouldn’t we be running away?”</p>
          <p>
            “If we get caught up in the fight while running, we’re dead meat!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Amidst the horrifying spectacle of destruction, Romad and his group
            could only tremble in fear. The waves of light from the clashes and
            the residual destructive power of the neutralized auras had already
            turned the clearing into a battlefield ruin. The power of aura users
            was indeed terrifying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Romad and his group hid behind a half-destroyed well, too
            terrified to even raise their heads, fearing instant death if caught
            in the aura waves. They didn’t dare think about escaping.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Sillan and Siris were relatively at ease watching the
            battle.
          </p>
          <p>“…Was Repenhardt an aura user?”</p>

          <p>“Huh? Didn’t I mention it?”</p>
          <p>
            Even amidst the fight with Lantas, Repenhardt was careful to ensure
            that the aftermath didn’t affect them. If a wave seemed to head
            their way, he’d block it with his body or neutralize it with an
            energy shot. To perform such feats while evenly matched in battle?
            Lantas muttered in disbelief,
          </p>
          <p>
            “What’s with this guy? His skill doesn’t look like someone who just
            awakened their aura!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas had awakened his aura more than ten years ago. Although he
            had become somewhat lazy, indulging in pleasures, he had experiences
            and years behind him. The basic stage of reinforcing his body with
            aura and overlaying it on his weapon was something Lantas had
            already surpassed, stepping into the level of manipulating the aura
            itself. That’s why he could now extend his aura long like a whip and
            wield it.
          </p>
          <p>Sssk!</p>
          <p>
            His red aura extended nearly three meters, wriggling like a snake,
            aiming for his opponent’s back. However, Repenhardt immediately
            turned around and shot a force bullet, destroying the whip. It was
            astounding. It had taken Lantas seven years to reach the level of
            manipulating the aura itself. Yet, this young brat was using a
            technique of a similar level. Even considering Lantas’s laxity,
            reaching such a level would normally require at least two to three
            years of relentless training.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, this guy had awakened his aura in his teens, or it
            meant he was over forty!
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it! Either way, it doesn’t make sense!”</p>
          <p>
            Grinding his teeth, Lantas unleashed a flurry of attacks. Repenhardt
            dodged them calmly, cursing under his breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Damn! How is this pervert so strong when he only targets kids?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his notorious reputation, Lantas’s swordsmanship was
            surprisingly fast and powerful. Moreover, this was Repenhardt’s
            first time facing a proper swordsman in combat. Although he had
            sparred with Gerard extensively, swordsmanship and martial arts were
            considerably different, and he hadn’t found a breakthrough yet.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh, so frustrating.”</p>
          <p>
            This was the man who tried to kidnap Siris. Repenhardt wished he
            could just beat him to death, but it was infuriating how sharp
            Lantas’s sword was, considering he was a pedophile. Repenhardt
            ducked and dodged a horizontal sword strike, gritting his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Anyone who says martial arts aid in cultivation of character, I’ll
            definitely beat them up.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, a true person of character resolves conflicts with words,
            not fists. It seemed clear that such sayings were probably invented
            by martial artists to boast. Amid these biased thoughts, Repenhardt
            kept firing force bullets.
          </p>
          <p>“Go!”</p>
          <p>
            But Lantas executed sword parrying, bursting all the force bullets.
            Repenhardt’s expression soured.
          </p>
          <p>“Tch!”</p>
          <p>
            Indeed, he was still shallow in manipulating the aura itself and
            couldn’t shoot force bullets as powerfully as Gerard. Although his
            current power was enough to warp steel and shatter rocks, it was
            still insufficient against aura wielders.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas immediately counterattacked. The red blade, meticulously
            aiming for vulnerabilities, pierced through the defenses. A sharp
            aura, filled with intense energy, targeted Repenhardt’s body. For a
            moment, Repenhardt considered bracing himself against the attack,
            but the idea was quickly dismissed. A miscalculation could lead to a
            dire situation.
          </p>
          <p>‘There’s no chance to dodge it…’</p>
          <p>
            Ultimately, Repenhardt unfolded the Spiral Guard, deflecting the
            blade. His forearms, wrapped in a golden aura and spinning, hardened
            his defense, and Lantas’s expression stiffened.
          </p>
          <p>‘Deflecting a sword with bare forearms, not even armored?’</p>

          <p>
            Indeed, both forearms were imbued with aura, yet the sheer toughness
            of those arms was astounding. Not a scratch or mark remained after
            blocking the blade. Lantas had heard of such a martial art that
            could enhance one’s body to such an unbelievable extent. It was so
            renowned that it was impossible not to know of it.
          </p>
          <p>He momentarily paused in shock.</p>
          <p>“… Could it be!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Repenhardt launched himself into the air. Twisting
            his massive body in a reverse somersault, he unleashed a kick
            charged with aura. The Reverse Somersault Kick aimed directly at
            Lantas, leaving him no chance to evade. Lantas raised his sword in
            defense, gathering all his aura into it.
          </p>
          <p>Aura clashed against aura, creating a thunderous boom.</p>
          <p>
            The wind blew. The clash of destructive forces boiled the
            atmosphere, generating small whirlwinds throughout the clearing. In
            this storm, the two aura wielders gauged each other’s reactions,
            catching their breaths. Sillan clicked his tongue upon witnessing
            this.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, if it were an ordinary duel, there’d be a role for me.’</p>
          <p>
            Sillan’s formidable divine power could amplify a warrior’s abilities
            beyond their limits. If these were regular warriors, he would have
            already bestowed his blessing to decide the victor.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, divine power does not apply to aura wielders. More
            precisely, it does apply, but to no effect. Aura wielders have
            already amplified their abilities to the extreme with their aura,
            far surpassing the amplification a priest’s divine blessing could
            provide. Thus, to aura wielders, receiving a blessing makes no
            difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite potentially sustaining injuries, he had been on the lookout
            for an opportunity to use healing magic from the start. However,
            since Repenhardt’s body was exceptionally sturdy, he hadn’t even
            gotten a scratch on him yet.
          </p>
          <p>It was during this standoff that Lantas suddenly spoke up.</p>
          <p>“Were you a disciple of Fist King Gerard?”</p>
          <p>
            His tone had shifted. Given Repenhardt was a mage and thus in a
            different industry, he simply hadn’t realized the enormity of
            Gerard’s reputation among martial artists. There was hardly any
            fighter of note who didn’t know of Fist King Gerard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt didn’t respond to the question. He was still troubled by
            his aversion to Gerard. However, Lantas seemed to have already
            concluded that he was indeed Gerard’s disciple, given the
            unmistakable style.
          </p>
          <p>Shaking his head as if in disbelief, Lantas asked again.</p>
          <p>
            “Why would someone as powerful as you be so preoccupied with mere
            slaves?”
          </p>
          <p>
            He seemed to completely ignore the fact that he himself was
            concerned about slave abduction. Repenhardt didn’t feel inclined to
            point this out. There were more infuriating matters at hand.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt clenched his teeth.</p>
          <p>“Who are you calling slaves…”</p>
          <p>
            A deep-seated anger flowed from his entire being. Lantas flinched.
            There had been a constant flow of murderous intent and hostility,
            but this was something different.
          </p>
          <p>This was a more pure and direct anger!</p>
          <p>
            “The ones you drag around as ‘slaves’ have minds and emotions too!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt launched himself forward, furiously dashing straight at
            Lantas with repeated bounds. Lantas grimaced and responded with a
            triple thrust attack. Three spears of aura left a red trail as they
            aimed for vital spots.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Have you ever truly spoken with them? Have you never once
            questioned the fact that they are considered ‘slaves’?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bursting with intense rage, Repenhardt swung his hand widely. He
            shattered the incoming spears of golden aura and surged towards
            Lantas like a comet, who stepped back in panic and exclaimed.
          </p>
          <p>“What nonsense are you spouting?”</p>
          <p>
            Lantas’ face was full of incomprehension, and seeing this,
            Repenhardt ground his teeth even harder.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone was like that. Even in his previous life, everyone had
            reacted the same way.

          <p>[ Chapter 40 ]</p>
          <p>
            The deep-rooted injustice in humanity! The firm belief that
            everything non-human is inferior!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when they see beings who walk on two legs, think, speak, laugh,
            cry, rejoice, and grieve just like humans, they do not even consider
            that these beings might have emotions and rationality!
          </p>
          <p>“What makes humans superior to elves, that they enslave them!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Lantas was flabbergasted. Although he himself had
            not lived a life considering morality or duty, such absurd thinking
            was new to him. Humans were deemed the most intelligent of
            creatures, thus justifying the enslavement of other races. This was
            a righteous principle set by the god Seiya.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Then, are you saying those born as slaves are meant to be something
            else?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s momentum intensified at Lantas’s foolish retort.</p>
          <p>
            “How could the descendants of the noble fairies be born to be
            slaves!”
          </p>
          <p>
            A relentless assault ensued. Despite being taken aback, Lantas
            coolly counterattacked, leaving marks of red on Repenhardt’s skin
            with the dance of his blade, yet none were fatal. Even in his
            excitement, Repenhardt’s body, honed through rigorous training,
            instinctively adopted the best form of attack and defense.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt, bursting with indignation, continued.</p>
          <p>
            “Have you never considered that if elves ruled the world, humans
            could be the slaves?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans cheered when the orcs were enslaved by the rulers. Because
            they were not orcs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans cheered when the dwarves were enslaved by the rulers. Because
            they were not dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans cheered when the elves were enslaved by the rulers. Because
            they were not elves.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, with the slave system deeply entrenched in the continent,
            even humans who are weak and powerless have begun to live difficult
            lives as serfs. This was the serfdom system.
          </p>
          <p>
            A misguided paradigm, once implemented, inevitably comes back to
            haunt its originators, yet foolish humans fail to recognize this.
          </p>
          <p>
            “By allowing others to be enslaved, you’re ultimately allowing
            yourself to be enslaved!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s anger was no longer directed at Lantas. It was a fury
            towards his powerless self and the irrational world filled with
            injustice. Yet, Lantas still failed to understand. Glancing at
            Siris, he retorted with a baffled expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Are you saying that elves are equal to humans? Are you out of your
            mind?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt finally erupted.</p>
          <p>“Siris is not a slave!”</p>
          <p>
            Spinning in midair, he stomped the ground again, channeling his
            outraged will into his fist, transforming it into a force of
            destruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas’s expression became desperate. The opponent’s movements were
            improving by the moment. He couldn’t understand it. It was commonly
            believed that losing one’s senses in rage only made one stronger in
            tales of adventure, while in reality, it usually just exposed more
            weaknesses. Yet, Repenhardt seemed sharper in his movements when
            slightly crazed!
          </p>
          <p>“What, what is this!”</p>
          <p>
            However, there was something Lantas didn’t know: Repenhardt was
            actually more composed now than ever. Until now, he had been merely
            using the martial arts he had learned, driven by the emotions of
            Teslon’s brute physical body. But at this moment, he was Repenhardt,
            the demon king of a previous life, a sorcerer enraged.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how enraged, a sorcerer does not lose his senses. Having
            regained his true self as a sorcerer, he was able to calmly analyze
            his opponent’s movements, separate from his anger.
          </p>
          <p>
            He continuously pressed the opponent with jabs and straights, aiming
            for the lower body to control the steps and then restricting
            movement with a punch filled with aura overhead. He was gradually
            becoming familiar with Lantas’s swordsmanship. Although the opponent
            was an aura wielder, he had neglected proper training for years in
            favor of indulgence. In every aspect, he was inferior to this body,
            honed to its peak!
          </p>
          <p>
            Like a spider draining the prey caught in its web, Repenhardt kept
            pressuring Lantas. His eyes blazed with rage.
          </p>
          <p>
            The one he loved and cherished more than his own life was being
            called a slave. Unacceptable. He could never accept such a world.
          </p>

          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>
            Cursing, Lantas swung his sword in a difficult flurry, delivering
            three consecutive slashes. Repenhardt dodged by spinning and
            counterattacked with an elbow strike, sharp enough to slice through
            rock. Lantas stumbled backward, tripping over his feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Repenhardt delivered a middle kick. It was a strike
            meant to break the opponent’s guard and inflict damage. The moment
            Lantas raised his arm to block, he felt his body go numb.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, no!’</p>
          <p>A look of despair flashed in his eyes.</p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a powerful yell, Repenhardt’s fist plunged into Lantas’s solar
            plexus. The single blow shattered his spine and pain spread
            throughout his body.
          </p>
          <p>“Grah!”</p>
          <p>
            Spitting blood, Lantas was hurled against the wall of a building,
            causing bricks to shatter and scatter across the floor. A long sword
            fell with a clang among the debris.
          </p>
          <p>Walking towards the fallen Lantas, Repenhardt murmured.</p>
          <p>“I will change it…”</p>
          <p>He would change it, no matter what.</p>
          <p>So that no one could ever call Siris a slave…</p>
          <p>So that no one could even conceive of the existence of slavery…</p>
          <p>For her, he would change this world!</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Siris watched the battle unfolding before her with a dazed
            expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            The power of an Aura user, something she had only heard about in
            stories, truly exceeded all imagination. Until now, she could hardly
            believe that a body made of flesh and blood could unleash such
            formidable force. Although she had heard unbelievable tales of Aura
            users in Elvenheim, she had always thought humans were prone to
            exaggeration.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the scene before her eyes made her wonder if those stories had
            been too modest in their descriptions.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is the realm of someone who has reached the pinnacle of
            martial arts!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris trembled with emotion. Despite her hatred for humans, as a
            martial artist herself, she couldn’t help but feel a sense of awe.
            Then, the shout of her hulking owner reached her ears.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris is not a slave!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Siris thought to herself, “He must be truly mad.”
          </p>
          <p>
            An elf, not a slave? The absurdity of his role-play was exceptional.
            It seemed that even an awakened Aura could not change a pervert.
            After all, wasn’t Lantas, who had also awakened his Aura, a vile
            pedophile?
          </p>
          <p>
            At that instant, Siris discarded all her admiration. The magnificent
            battle before her eyes was nothing more than a lesser pervert and a
            greater pervert fighting each other fiercely.
          </p>
          <p>“Yet…”</p>
          <p>
            Despite herself, she couldn’t stop a certain warmth in her heart,
            and her eyes began to well up with tears. There was sincerity in the
            booming voice of her large owner. Even if it was just a pervert’s
            role-play, that human genuinely believed Siris was not a slave.
          </p>
          <p>-We were the descendants of the great fairies.</p>
          <p>
            “Why would the descendants of the great fairies be born to be
            slaves!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The mad, hulking owner was now echoing the words of the elders of
            her tribe.
          </p>

          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            Buried under a pile of bricks, Lantas groaned. The attack would have
            killed anyone else instantly, but a faint Aura was still keeping him
            alive. However, it was clear that without immediate healing from a
            priest, he wouldn’t last much longer.
          </p>
          <p>He looked up at Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>“Please, spare me.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was incredulous. Did this man actually believe he would
            be spared after all the crimes he had committed?
          </p>
          <p>“Why would I spare a pervert who preys on children?”</p>
          <p>Then, with a serious expression, Lantas declared.</p>
          <p>
            “I swear on my sword, I will dedicate the rest of my life to good
            deeds. I will spend my life reflecting on my sins!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lantas was bleeding, yet he wore an expression brimming with
            sincerity. Repenhardt looked down at him with an indifferent face.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Judging by your expression alone, you really seem to be repenting…”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, that’s right!”</p>
          <p>
            His wrinkled face was full of remorse. Based solely on his current
            expression, he indeed appeared to be reflecting on his actions.
            However, Repenhardt scoffed at this display. Suddenly, he changed
            the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I really hate the Seiya Order. Especially that thing they call
            confession; I truly dislike it.”
          </p>
          <p>Even as he was dying, Lantas wore a puzzled expression.</p>
          <p>
            “So, you do all sorts of things, then go to the temple, secretly
            speak up, and that’s it, you’re absolved? If you’re truly repentant,
            you should go to the police and turn yourself in, why head to a
            Seiya temple?”
          </p>
          <p>“Of course, I’ll turn myself in as well!”</p>
          <p>“Well, I’m not particularly fond of murder anyway…”</p>
          <p>
            His tone somewhat suggested he might spare Lantas’s life. Anxiously,
            Lantas exclaimed,
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s no need to dirty your hands by killing someone like me!”
          </p>
          <p>At that, Repenhardt threw a cold sneer.</p>
          <p>“But I’m already covered in quite a bit of blood, aren’t I?”</p>
          <p>
            While it was true Repenhardt didn’t take pleasure in murder, in his
            past life, the number of people he killed had surpassed four digits,
            nearing five. It wasn’t for nothing he was called a Demon King.
            Unlike swordsmen, a truly powerful magician could wipe out thousands
            of lives in an instant with widespread spells.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, I’ll believe you truly repented.”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Repenhardt nodded generously. Lantas’s face brightened.
            That’s when it happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Since you’ve truly repented, you must feel it’s only right to die,
            right? Hm? Don’t you want to beg to be killed to pay for your sins?
            Hm? You said you reflected, didn’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>“That, that’s not!”</p>
          <p>
            It was too chilling to be mere sarcasm; Lantas was panic-stricken
            and stuttered just when—
          </p>
          <p>Thud!</p>

          <p>
            A golden aura struck his head. Without even a scream, the part that
            was Lantas’s head turned into a bloody mess and disappeared.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt withdrew his hand and coldly admonished,</p>
          <p>
            “Don’t overuse the word ‘repentance’. It’s not a word for someone
            like you to use.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Lantas died like a street dog. Despite being an aura user and
            once a knight famous in the Teikan Kingdom, his end was too
            miserable.
          </p>
          <p>“People should live humanely.”</p>
          <p>
            Muttering to himself, Repenhardt suddenly sported a bitter smile. It
            wasn’t quite a comment a former Demon King should make.
          </p>
          <p>
            After shattering Lantas, Repenhardt immediately approached Sillan
            and Siris.
          </p>
          <p>He inspected Siris’s entire body, asking with concern,</p>
          <p>“Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?”</p>
          <p>
            By then, Siris had already been fully healed by Sillan’s healing
            magic. Turning to look at Sillan, Repenhardt marveled at his own
            foresight.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah! Bringing this top-notch healer was indeed a wise decision!’ he
            thought, patting Sillan on the head in approval. Annoyed by being
            treated like a child, Sillan irritably pulled away. It was then that
            Siris hesitated before softly speaking up.
          </p>
          <p>“Are… are you alright, Lord Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>
            His earlier shout had unmistakably stirred something within her,
            prompting her to speak out. Repenhardt’s eyes welled up with
            emotion.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris!”</p>
          <p>He trembled with deep feeling.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah! Siris spoke to me! Her voice is still cold, but that she spoke
            at all is something, isn’t it? Is this what it feels like when a
            skittish cat finally eats from your hand?’
          </p>
          <p>
            His expression became oddly poignant. Siris, taken aback, quickly
            put some distance between them.
          </p>
          <p>‘This man is definitely strange…’</p>
          <p>
            Her expression hardened once again. Yet, Repenhardt was not
            disheartened, having expected her to not open up so soon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris turned to look at a corner of the clearing, where the remnants
            of her shattered scimitar lay. She felt a twinge of regret.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It might have been a gift from a pervert, but it was a piece I
            quite liked…’
          </p>
          <p>Sensing her mood, Repenhardt quickly reassured her.</p>
          <p>“Don’t worry, I’ll get you something much better.”</p>
          <p>
            It was surprising how he could read her so well, causing Siris to
            stiffen her expression even more. Nonetheless, there was no reason
            to object if he was offering to replace it.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>Just then, Sillan spoke up with a sharp tone.</p>
          <p>“Lord Repenhardt, those guys are getting away.”</p>
          <p>
            The Romad group, sneaking away behind the well, froze in their
            tracks. With a relaxed voice, Repenhardt responded,
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, I know.”</p>
          <p>He turned to look at Romad with a grin.</p>
          <p>“Come here.”</p>
          <p>
            The petrified group of Romad demonstrated remarkable flexibility,
            turning their upper bodies while keeping their lower halves facing
            backward. Repenhardt chuckled lightly.
          </p>
          <p>“Running away?”</p>
          <p>
            The menacing men trembled as if struck by a blast of wind. He
            continued,
          </p>
          <p>“Go ahead. I’ll show you something good.”</p>
