          <p>[ Chapter 61]</p>
          <p>Gelpheid stood up, dusting off his seat.</p>
          <p>
            “I share this story in hopes that you will understand us better. We
            dwarves can hear the sound of truth. Therefore, hiding anything from
            us is not an easy task. Knowing this, most humans tend to avoid
            conversing with dwarves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am well aware of that,” Repenhardt scratched his head, as
            Gelpheid offered a broad smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            “However, we also listen to the sincerity in voices, not just the
            truth. So, if you bear goodwill towards us, there’s no need to
            hesitate in dealing with us. We know no deception, thus no
            misunderstandings arise.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yes, I am quite aware of that as well,” Repenhardt returned the
            smile, to which Gelpheid looked intrigued again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You truly know this. It’s fascinating, how someone as young as you
            understands us so well. Of course, you couldn’t possibly share how
            you came to know this, could you?”
          </p>
          <p>“I’m afraid now is not the time, sorry.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt then stood up, and Gelpheid called out to Tilla outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Take some time to get yourself together. Meanwhile, we’ll have our
            guide prepare.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as they were about to leave the room, a loud voice echoed from
            afar.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey there! Savior, sir!”</p>
          <p>
            An old dwarf burst into the room, causing Gelpheid to frown and ask,
            “What is it, Hetos?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Ignoring Gelpheid’s question, Hetos frantically asked Repenhardt,
            “Did you happen to come here with companions? An elf and a young
            human boy?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s expression hardened. “Indeed, they are part of my
            group. Is something the matter?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hetos sighed deeply and stroked his beard. “It seems they have been
            captured and are being held at Viscount Kelberen’s castle.”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            After capturing the thieves’ accomplices and returning to Kelberen
            Castle, Eusus von Tenes called two of his knights and issued a grave
            command.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Make them confess everything! Forget chivalry for now. Any form of
            torture is permitted! We must find out the location where last
            night’s thief is hiding. Understand?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The order was so strict that it bordered on brutal. The two knights,
            Lento and Baras, looked at each other in shock. Torture? They
            blinked, wondering if they had heard wrong. Their leader, Eusus, was
            the epitome of knighthood. It was unthinkable for him to utter
            something as dishonorable as torture.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Eusus did not give them a chance to protest. He simply waved
            them off with a stern face.
          </p>
          <p>“Retire for now.”</p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the two knights paid their respects and left the room,
            heading down to the dungeon, pondering deeply. The abstract
            expression of their commander made it clear that this matter was of
            great importance. They understood that it was necessary to extract
            all the information, even if it meant resorting to torture.
          </p>

          <p>
            The problem was that both were honorable members of the Tenes
            Knights, and torture was far removed from their practices. Of
            course, as knights, they had faced many battles, but torture was a
            different matter entirely.
          </p>
          <p>“How do we even go about torturing? Just hit them carelessly?”</p>
          <p>
            “What if they die? We can’t kill them, but torture means to inflict
            enough pain without killing, right?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, this is difficult.”</p>
          <p>
            Lento and Baras looked at each other, troubled. After descending
            into the castle’s dungeon, they stood in front of a cell door.
            Inside were a captured elf girl and a pilgrim boy, both bound.
          </p>
          <p>“Anyway, it’s an order, so we must follow through.”</p>
          <p>“Right. I’ll start the interrogation, Baras.”</p>
          <p>“Understood, Lento.”</p>
          <p>
            Sighing, the two entered. Upon opening the door, they saw a
            beautiful boy with red long hair, bound in chains. Drawn on the
            floor was a sealing circle, a special barrier installed by the
            priests of the sky goddess, Aerius, to suppress the pilgrim boy’s
            holy power.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am Lento of the Tenes Knights,” Lento said in a cold voice,
            looking at the boy, Sillan, who weakly lifted his head to meet his
            gaze. Lento swallowed hard.
          </p>
          <p>“Uhmm…”</p>
          <p>
            The boy’s delicate limbs and refined facial features made him appear
            pitifully frail. How were they supposed to torture someone who
            looked like they could die from a mere touch?
          </p>
          <p>Lento began the interrogation with a sense of doom.</p>
          <p>And half an hour later.</p>
          <p>“…Uhmm.”</p>
          <p>The two knights were groaning, looking at the bound Sillan.</p>
          <p>
            “So, Mr. Repen’s martial arts training is a bit too harsh. You’ve
            heard, right? The martial arts of Fist King Gerard of Gym
            Unbreakable. The training they do there is like this…”
          </p>
          <p>“Um, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            “…They train like that. Doesn’t it seem a bit inhumane? Honestly,
            you knights haven’t trained to that extent, have you?”
          </p>
          <p>“Um, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            “Given how tough the training is, the final test is no joke either.
            It involves retrieving that relic. But the Tenes Count family got to
            the relic first, they say. If you can’t pass the test, you can
            imagine the consequences. If the training is that harsh, imagine the
            punishment?”
          </p>
          <p>“Um, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            “So, we’re saying we had to take that artifact, even if it meant
            resorting to theft, because it originally belonged to Gym
            Unbreakable, and we suspect that even the King of Fists didn’t
            anticipate the discovery of that ruin. Given how little information
            was available about the ruin, isn’t it proof that no other artifacts
            were tampered with?”
          </p>

          <p>“Um, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Before the questioning could even begin, the person on the other
            side had already spilled everything voluntarily. Thanks to this,
            Lento’s only contributions for half an hour were ‘Um, yes.’ What
            else could he say? There was no need for torture or even
            interrogation when the other party was freely divulging information,
            including details not even asked for.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Anyway, I wasn’t exactly in favor of this plan myself. But after
            hearing about the situation, I understood and ended up just staying
            in the village. Ah, talking too much made my mouth dry. Could I get
            a glass of water, please?”
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? Oh, sure.”</p>
          <p>
            Baras, who had been standing there dazed, got swept up in the moment
            and fetched a glass of water.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, refreshing. Anyway…”</p>
          <p>
            Really, he was quite talkative. Moreover, his calm demeanor, despite
            being tied up, made it almost seem unfair to think of him as
            pitiful. Listening to him, one might even start worrying for Lento
            instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hey, look. Even if it’s about your companions, is it really okay to
            tell us everything? What about loyalty?”
          </p>
          <p>“There’s nothing to hide, really.”</p>
          <p>
            “But if it becomes known that the heir of the Fist King resorted to
            theft, it could tarnish your honor…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “If we were concerned about honor, we shouldn’t have stolen in the
            first place, right?”
          </p>
          <p>“Well, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Thus, Sillan went on to detail everything from his background and
            how he became a priest of Philanence to how he met Repenhardt and
            Siris, and how he ended up here. Even in the process, he cleverly
            skipped over any potentially damaging information—such as incidents
            caused in the Chatan Principality—so smoothly that Lento and Baras
            didn’t find it awkward at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite feeling something was off, they got so caught up in the
            story that they just nodded along. Eventually, Lento had no choice
            but to interrupt Sillan’s monologue to ask a crucial question.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Anyway, I understand the situation. But what’s important is the
            whereabouts of the stolen artifact. Are you saying you don’t know
            where it is?”
          </p>
          <p>The answer came promptly.</p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know. We just decided to return to that inn, after all.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lento finally caught a loophole. With the stern attitude of an
            interrogator, he thundered.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What are you talking about! You must have arranged a way to contact
            in case of an emergency, hadn’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Why would we? You know by now, don’t you? That man is an Aura User.
            Who would imagine an Aura User failing at mere theft?”
          </p>
          <p>“That, that’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            Intending to scold, Lento found himself speechless in the face of
            Sillan’s logical response. Thus, the interrogation ended with Lento
            and Varas leaving the cell with awkward expressions.
          </p>
          <p>“Is this how interrogation is supposed to be done?”</p>

          <p>“Something feels off about this…”</p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, having gathered the necessary information, they had to
            report to Eusus. Shaking their heads in confusion, the two knights
            ascended the stairs heading upstairs.
          </p>
          <p>
            In one of the reception rooms of Viscount Kelberen’s residence,
            Eusus was silently looking out the window.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, he recalled the voice of Sir Lot.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Why are you so concerned? Of course, the honor of the Tenes Knights
            has been slightly tarnished by this incident, but it wasn’t an
            ordinary opponent, so it doesn’t seem to be a big problem.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot’s words were not wrong. It would indeed be a disgrace if the
            Tenes County’s estate was robbed by a mere thief. However, the Tenes
            Knights had not simply been overrun; they had indeed repelled the
            enemy. Moreover, it was already known that the opponent was not an
            ordinary thief but an Aura User. Even without manifesting Aura,
            having matched Eusus, who manipulates Eldrad, proved he was an Aura
            User.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were countless relics from the ruins of Elucion, and only one
            unidentified relic was lost. Besides, they managed to splendidly
            repel the intruder, even though they let him escape. In this regard,
            there shouldn’t be any damage to the honor of the Tenes Count
            family.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, it wasn’t unreasonable for Sir Lot and the other knights to
            think Eusus was overreacting a bit strangely.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, it can’t just be a coincidence. Otherwise, why out of so many
            relics, that one had to be taken…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking out the window, Eusus murmured to himself, recalling an
            event from a month ago.
          </p>
          <p>‘Yes, that young man with black hair…’</p>
          <p>
            Eusus was, as usual, deeply engrossed in his training at the
            mansion’s private training ground. It was then that a young man
            suddenly appeared from a corner of the training ground.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you Sir Eusus, the Golden Knight of Graim?”</p>
          <p>
            It was inevitably surprising. His training ground was among the most
            secluded places within the Viscount’s estate. And to think that
            someone had breached the strict defenses of the Viscount’s estate?
            The word ‘assassin’ would normally come to mind first in such
            situations.
          </p>
          <p>“Who are you!”</p>
          <p>Eusus shouted, glaring at the intruder.</p>
          <p>
            The young man was remarkably handsome, with jet-black hair and
            obsidian-like eyes, and despite his appearance, his body was
            well-developed in a balanced manner, indicating he was a formidable
            martial artist.
          </p>
          <p>
            He seemed like a challenging opponent, especially since Eusus was
            not wearing his magical armor Eldrad during his training. As Eusus
            was on high alert, the young man pulled out a small emblem from his
            bosom.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you are the heir of the Count Tenes family, you should recognize
            this emblem.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A silver emblem, intricately crafted with various mythical creatures
            among giant trees, suddenly made Eusus ask in surprise,
          </p>
          <p>“The Silver Sage?”</p>
          <p>
            It was on the day he officially became the heir. That day, Eusus had
            been entrusted by his father, Viscount Tenes, with a secret passed
            down only to the heirs of the family.
          </p>
          <p>
            A secret shared only with the most loyal and trustworthy families of
            the Graim Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>About the existence of the ‘Silver Sages’.</p>
          <p>Beings with the power to even destroy a nation.</p>
          <p>Sages who far surpass the current age’s wisdom and knowledge.</p>
          <p>
            Despite possessing the power to influence the entire continent, they
            never reveal themselves, existing only in the shadows, invisibly
            protecting humanity and only appearing when humanity is in crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea that such beings, capable of influencing the continent
            while remaining hidden, existed was shocking to Eusus. It was also
            unbelievable. The world is not so simple as to be manipulated by
            just a few individuals.

          <p>Chapter 62</p>
          <p>
            But Eusus had to acknowledge the existence of a Silver Sage, and
            moreover, one with considerable power, upon hearing the subsequent
            words of Count Tenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It might be hard to believe. I felt the same when my father passed
            this secret to me. However, Eusus, one of the Silver Sages is
            someone you know very well.”
          </p>
          <p>“Excuse me?”</p>
          <p>
            “It’s King Hyde El Graim II of the Graim Kingdom, our sovereign.
            I’ve heard that His Majesty holds a mid-level position within the
            Silver Sages. This is directly from His Majesty, so there’s no room
            for doubt.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The notion that a few mysterious sages could wield significant
            influence across the continent was unbelievable. After all, if they
            possessed such power, there would be no need for them to live in
            hiding. However, the narrative changes entirely if a country’s king
            is involved. It implies that other Silver Sages also exist in the
            world in other high-ranking positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Why a king would need to be part of a secretive organization, and
            the truth of him being a mid-level member was dubious. However, one
            thing was certain:
          </p>
          <p>
            The Silver Sages indeed existed, and they possessed enough power to
            easily trample over a household like the Tenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, Eusus had no choice but to kneel hastily in front of this
            unidentified young man. The emblem was a testament to being a Silver
            Sage, and Eusus had to show the same loyalty as he would before the
            king, as it was part of the secret passed down to him.
          </p>
          <p>“I greet the Silver Sage.”</p>
          <p>
            Observing Eusus bowing respectfully, the young man with black hair
            silently handed over a piece of parchment.
          </p>
          <p>“What is this?”</p>
          <p>
            Inspecting the parchment, Eusus was perplexed. It contained
            information about an ancient ruin that had remained undiscovered
            until now. The details were so precise that it was puzzling why the
            site hadn’t been explored yet.
          </p>
          <p>The young man said in a calm voice,</p>
          <p>
            “I would like the Tenes household to undertake the exploration of
            this ruin, Elucion. All artifacts are yours to keep, except for one
            thing that I desire. What say you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus was thrilled. If the information was accurate, there was no
            reason not to go on the expedition. The terms were too favorable.
            All artifacts could be taken except for one – a mysterious magical
            device named ‘Voice of Elucion’, as per the parchment.
          </p>
          <p>
            He immediately accepted. There was no refusing a request from a
            Silver Sage, and besides, the offer was too good.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Eusus didn’t pay much attention to the young man’s
            warning.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Should you fail, the fate of the Tenes household won’t be smooth
            either.”
          </p>
          <p>“Sigh…”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus sighed again. If he couldn’t recover the the stolen relic, the
            Voice of Elucion, he couldn’t begin to imagine the disgrace it would
            bring upon the von Tenes family. The current king, Graim II, was
            also a member of the Silver Sages. Should he fail in this task, the
            repercussions might extend far beyond merely incurring the wrath of
            that mysterious young man.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It must be a conspiracy by other families aiming to check the power
            of the von Tenes,” he concluded. There seemed to be no other reason
            why an Aura wielder, of all people, would steal that particular
            artifact.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Such families would indeed have the power to employ an Aura
            wielder.”
          </p>
          <p>Suppressing his frustration, Eusus continued to gaze outside.</p>
          <p>At that moment, someone knocked on the door.</p>
          <p>“Enter.”</p>
          <p>
            It was Lento and Baras. The two knights entered with uneasy
            expressions. Lento spoke first after a hesitant pause.
          </p>
          <p>“We have completed the interrogation, but…”</p>
          <p>
            Baras continued with a troubled tone, “It’s just, the stories add up
            perfectly, but something feels off, it doesn’t seem quite right.”
          </p>
          <p>“What do you mean?” Eusus asked, looking puzzledly at the two.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            In a lush forest, with Viscount Kelberen’s castle visible in the
            distance, a tall, well-built young man and a petite girl barely
            reaching the young man’s chest walked under the afternoon sun
            shining through the leaves. They were Repenhardt, who had dashed out
            of the dwarf village upon hearing the news about Sillan and Siris,
            and Tilla, the dwarf girl assigned by Gelpheid to guide him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leading the way, Tilla suddenly looked back and asked, “But
            Repenhardt, if you’re in such a hurry, is it alright for us to be
            walking like this?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had rushed until they passed through the tunnel leading
            out of the village to the surface. Tilla had struggled to keep up
            with his pace. Yet, once they had neared the forest close to the
            castle, he no longer hurried and walked at a leisurely pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Tilla’s question, Repenhardt smiled warmly and replied, “No
            matter how urgent, it’s foolish to rush into a fight with the Golden
            Knight without having fully recovered. One act of folly is enough.”
          </p>
          <p>“Folly?”</p>
          <p>
            Tilla tilted her head, not understanding, but then shrugged it off.
            Dwarves, capable of hearing the truth, were not prone to prying into
            others’ affairs too deeply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt resumed walking, spreading his sense of aura broadly
            around him. Using his entire aura to maximize his sensory range, he
            felt the breath of the forest. Suddenly, he gestured to Tilla to
            stop.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Could you wait here for a moment? Oh, and I’d be even more grateful
            if you could light a fire.”
          </p>
          <p>“Will do.”</p>
          <p>
            No sooner had Tilla answered than Repenhardt took off, dashing
            towards the other side of the forest. Watching his retreating
            figure, Tilla reached for her waist.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright, then. Let’s get ready to start a fire in a proper way.”
          </p>
          <p>
            She gathered the scattered pieces of wood and ignited a fire,
            breaking off branches from an old tree to keep the flames alive.
            There was no race on the continent as skilled in handling fire as
            the dwarves. In no time, Tilla had managed to light a splendid
            bonfire in a clearing of the forest.
          </p>
          <p>
            After squatting down and waiting for about five more minutes,
            Repenhardt reappeared from the bushes. He had not just returned, but
            had something significantly large in his hand.
          </p>

          <p>“Uh? Repenhardt, what’s that?”</p>
          <p>“A deer.”</p>
          <p>
            He was holding a large wild deer, its head completely severed,
            indicating he had been hunting. Of course, Tilla didn’t ask because
            she didn’t know what a deer was. She murmured in admiration.
          </p>
          <p>“You, you managed to find a deer in such a short time?”</p>
          <p>
            Although she had never hunted before, she knew well enough that
            hunting wasn’t something that could be done so easily. An
            experienced hunter would need to understand the prey’s habits and
            track it for days to aim for such a result. If wild animals could be
            caught in a matter of minutes, there would be no one starving in the
            world.
          </p>
          <p>“How on earth did you catch it? And in such a short time?”</p>
          <p>
            While hanging the dead deer from a tree to bleed it out, Repenhardt
            replied nonchalantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s nothing if you have aura. Just expand your sensory field to
            pinpoint its location.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The next issue after finding prey was approaching it without being
            noticed. This would be difficult for any hunter not skilled enough —
            considering the wind direction, terrain, and more — but Repenhardt
            easily solved this problem.
          </p>
          <p>‘If you don’t approach, that’s the end of it.’</p>
          <p>
            He shot an energy bullet from a distance far enough that the deer
            couldn’t even sense the danger, blowing its head off in one shot.
            Listening to the story, Tilla clicked her tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hunting seems really easy for you. Professional hunters would feel
            wronged and might even get sick from frustration.”
          </p>
          <p>“…It wasn’t that easy.”</p>
          <p>
            In truth, it wasn’t as if Repenhardt had found the deer’s location
            in just a few minutes. His sensory field, when fully exerted, could
            detect up to a radius of about 100 meters. He had continuously
            walked through the forest, focusing all his senses on detection, for
            about 30 minutes before finally spotting the deer. So, contrary to
            Tilla’s assumption, it wasn’t a simple matter of stumbling upon it
            and catching it on the fly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even so, if there weren’t so many game animals around, we wouldn’t
            have found them this quickly. There seem to be a lot of deer here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of course, it’s Viscount Kelberen’s hunting ground, so hunting is
            forbidden for others…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Tilla frowned. She hadn’t thought of it until now, but
            hunting in this forest was legally prohibited.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Speaking of which, since this is the lord’s hunting ground, if we
            carelessly hunt deer…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, I’ve decided not to worry about such trivial things anymore.”
          </p>
          <p>“…?”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing Tilla’s puzzled expression, Repenhardt let out a bitter
            smile. Yes, there’s no need to worry about the trivial things. How
            could they liberate the various races if they were to strictly
            adhere to every law?
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Slave liberation itself is clearly illegal according to the customs
            of the continent.’
          </p>

          <p>
            In any case, there was no time to dawdle. Repenhardt began to
            process the deer he had hung up, intending to drain its blood more
            quickly. Tilla might think he appeared relaxed, but in reality,
            Repenhardt was hurrying.
          </p>
          <p>‘I need to recover my strength soon.’</p>
          <p>
            After draining enough blood, Repenhardt sharpened his hand.
            Following his chi, a golden aura shone sharply. With the guidance of
            his aura, Repenhardt sliced through the deer. The wild deer’s hide
            split instantly, as if it had been cut by a legendary sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            After skinning the deer, Repenhardt quickly removed the entrails and
            emitted aura to scrape off the dirt stuck to the meat. Without brine
            to wash the innards, he did not hesitate to cut off the dirty parts,
            selecting only the clean meat, and skewering it by type to cook over
            a fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching Repenhardt swiftly disassemble a deer, Tilla clicked her
            tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You’re quite skilled, huh? Looks like you’ve caught and eaten a lot
            of deer before?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, I learned it a long time ago.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his cheek. It was in his previous life, when he
            roamed the continent as a wandering sorcerer. He had incidentally
            met a master hunter while searching for ruins and learned from him
            how to survive in the forest.
          </p>
          <p>
            “He was an amazing person. With just a knife and a flint, he
            magically managed to live well off the bare ground.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When there was nothing to eat, he would eat bugs, rats, and somehow
            manage to find a place to sleep in the barren wilderness… Anyway, he
            was a person with exceptional survival skills. He even earned the
            nickname “The Bear Roaster” because he could cook a bear if he
            encountered one.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Thanks to him, I learned a lot. Though, I have no desire to live
            like that man, eating spiders to survive.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Amidst this, the deer meat began to cook, releasing a savory aroma.
            Tilla inadvertently swallowed her saliva. Having lived as a slave,
            her meals had been limited to a few potatoes and gruel. She couldn’t
            even remember the last time she had seen meat.
          </p>
          <p>“……Gulp!”</p>
          <p>
            Any questions she had about why they were grilling meat in such a
            dire situation had already vanished from her mind. Repenhardt
            couldn’t help but smile fondly at the sight of Tilla drooling.
          </p>
          <p>“Do you want some too, Tilla?”</p>
          <p>“I would love to!”</p>
          <p>
            No sooner had she spoken than Tilla squeezed into the seat next to
            him and grabbed a piece of meat. Holding a large front leg
            carefully, she began to nibble on it. Repenhardt smiled warmly again
            before starting to tear into the meat himself.
          </p>
          <p>Chomp, chomp, smack, smack.</p>
          <p>
            The two of them ate the deer meat, their faces smudged with soot.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a while, Tilla, feeling moderately full, put down her hands
            with a satisfied expression. Eating too much meat after such a long
            time could cause stomach troubles, and despite looking like a young
            girl, she was a fully grown adult dwarf who wasn’t so immature as to
            ruin her health with gluttony.
          </p>
          <p>But then…</p>
          <p>“Re, Repenhardt? Aren’t you eating too much?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was tearing into the meat relentlessly. While Tilla had
            been nibbling on a bit of the deer’s shoulder, he had already
            finished both hind legs and was now working on the ribs, moving on
            to the front legs.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I mean, it’s not like he’s been deprived of meat before, why is he
            like this?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Astonished, Tilla looked at Repenhardt. It was surprising enough
            that someone could eat so quickly, but the fact that his stomach
            could hold so much food was even more astonishing. He seemed set on
            consuming an entire deer by himself. No, at this rate, he really
            would.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this, Tilla noticed something unusual and her eyes widened in
            surprise.
          </p>
          <p>‘His body?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s entire body was glowing with a faint golden light. As
            he continued to stuff meat into his belly, which swelled and then
            deflated, his rough skin regained its vitality, his muscles bulged
            anew, and a lively vigor returned to his entire body.

            [ Chapter 62 (part 2) ]<br />
            ‘My goodness, can that even happen?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Tilla marveled. She had heard that aura users could recover their
            bodies by consuming large amounts of food and then using their aura,
            but she had never seen eating and recovery happening simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Munching on meat ceaselessly, Repenhardt recalled the maxim of his
            master, Gerard.
          </p>
          <p>-You cannot become strong without eating meat!</p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah, it’s such an ignorant notion, but the problem is, it’s not
            incorrect.’
          </p>
          <p>
            At least, for Gym Unbreakable, this philosophy was indeed a truth.
            Despite inwardly rolling his eyes, Repenhardt devoured an entire
            deer he had caught.
          </p>
          <p>
            He chewed and swallowed the last piece. Then, closing his eyes, he
            sensed the vitality throughout his body. Even though he had
            recovered quite a bit, his body was not perfect when he had left the
            dwarf village. Perhaps around 60% of his usual condition?
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, his body was filled with vigor. His muscles throughout his
            body felt overflowing with strength, as if they were screaming to
            leap into action at any moment.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, shall we test it?”</p>
          <p>
            After steadying his breath, Repenhardt suddenly punched into the
            air.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The air tore apart with a loud noise, and a storm blew, instantly
            snuffing out the campfire at his feet. Tilla’s mouth gaped open.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow!”</p>
          <p>
            Normally, martial artists perform a show where they extinguish a
            candle with a punch, creating a gust of wind. Repenhardt did that
            with a campfire. It was truly an act beyond human capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>“Good, I’m at 100%.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt retracted his fist, showing a satisfied smile.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“Ugh….”</p>
          <p>
            Leaning his chin on a lavishly decorated table, Eusus was in a
            quandary.
          </p>
          <p>
            After hearing the reports from Lento and Baras, Eusus immediately
            scolded them. The report itself seemed quite plausible, but Eusus
            knew the inside story that the other knights did not.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No, why would the Silver Sage possibly want anything from Gym
            Unbreakable!’
          </p>
          <p>
            He couldn’t possibly discuss the existence of the Silver Sage, a
            secret among secrets, with them. Ultimately, Eusus decided to go
            down to the dungeon himself, ready to interrogate directly, even if
            it meant compromising his dignity. He was even prepared to resort to
            torture if necessary, to extract the whole truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Eusus found himself in the same predicament as Lento and
            Baras. He couldn’t find any fault, let alone torture them.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Oh, you want me to repeat what I’ve already said? Well, I can do
            that.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sillan repeated the same story in front of Eusus without any
            hesitation. Thus, Eusus was even more baffled. To him, it didn’t
            seem like Sillan was lying at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how skilled one is at lying, inconsistencies inevitably
            arise with enough questioning. Yet, Sillan did not avert his gaze,
            nor did he fumble his words. Certainly, a spy formally trained in
            intelligence could manage such deceptive testimony. But this boy,
            Sillan, was a pilgrim — a cleric, to be precise.
          </p>
          <p>
            This does not imply that clerics are incapable of lying. Indeed,
            there are spies who masquerade as pilgrims to extract information
            from foreign lands. However…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘A high-ranking cleric with bishop-level divine power undergoing
            espionage training? Unlikely. Especially at such a young age.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Mastering the art of lying to such a degree at a young age without
            substantial training is impossible. And to receive such training
            while also being a bishop-level cleric? That’s practically
            unfeasible.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the crux of Eusus’s headache. No matter how he looked at
            it, the boy Sillan wasn’t lying. Torture or interrogation only has
            meaning if there’s suspicion. But with Sillan’s demeanor, the truth
            seemed too evident to question.
          </p>
          <p>‘He believes what he’s saying to be the truth.’</p>
          <p>
            Since he believes it, there’s no hesitation in his speech. Had Eusus
            not known the truth, he might have been deceived by such a plausible
            story.
          </p>
          <p>‘In other words, these kids are completely unrelated…’</p>
          <p>
            Originally, Eusus had detained Sillan and Siris, hoping the thief
            from the previous night would come to rescue his companions.
            Otherwise, the opportunity to catch them again would be indefinitely
            delayed. But if what was said is true, the likelihood of the night’s
            thief returning for these children is exceedingly slim.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘He’ll likely abandon the kids without a second thought after
            getting their wounds treated.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus had momentarily entertained the thought that perhaps, out of
            affection, the thief would return for the Slayer elf girl. After
            all, Slayers are too valuable to simply forsake.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Eusus soon scoffed and shook his head in disbelief. Would
            anyone be that foolish? If the commission came from another family,
            especially one involving a confrontation with a Golden Knight, the
            sum involved would be no small matter. The reward for such a feat
            could easily cover the cost of two or three Slayers, eliminating any
            need to risk returning for them.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            How could he possibly recapture someone he had once let slip away?
            Well, eventually, with the power of the Tenes family at his
            disposal…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Even if by some luck we catch the thief, by then the Voice of
            Elucion would have already passed into the hands of another family.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Catching the thief was imperative. So was retrieving the relic, and
            all of this had to be accomplished before the thief could pass the
            artifact to another family.
          </p>
          <p>
            There seemed to be no way forward. No matter how much he pondered, a
            solution evaded him.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was during such a moment of frustration that Eusus was
            unexpectedly interrupted.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            An immense energy surged from the far end of the fortress, startling
            Eusus to his feet.
          </p>
          <p>“What is this?!”</p>
          <p>
            He was not wearing the magical armor Eldrad at the moment. Yet, the
            energy was so profound that he could feel it without the armor.
            Moreover, this energy was not unfamiliar to him.
          </p>
          <p>‘This energy is…’</p>

          <p>
            It was a feeling he recognized. The very same energy he had
            enthusiastically clashed with the night before.
          </p>
          <p>‘The aura-user thief?’</p>
          <p>
            What Eusus felt at that moment was not relief or welcome, but sheer
            incredulity.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Really, he came back? Why? Was he that attached to the Slayer?’
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Drain, looking far more tense than usual, was on guard duty atop the
            fortress wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            His job, guarding the outer walls of Viscount Kelberen’s fortress,
            was usually so uneventful it could be considered a sinecure. The
            Kelberen Viscounty, nestled beside the Setellad Mountains,
            remarkably saw few monster appearances and maintained good relations
            with neighboring territories. Moreover, the lord did not excessively
            tax his subjects, so there was little risk of rebellion. It was
            virtually unheard of for anyone to attack this fortress.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that was only true until the previous night. Recalling the
            mysterious thief who had infiltrated, Drain shivered. His fellow
            guard, Kaltan, noticed his unease and asked,
          </p>
          <p>“What’s wrong, Drain? Caught a cold?”</p>
          <p>“No, just thinking about yesterday.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, right. It was a terrifying scene indeed.”</p>
          <p>
            To be honest, neither had a clear recollection of the events. What
            they remembered was something akin to a dark cloud enveloping them,
            and then they blacked out (they were the unfortunate guards whom
            Repenhardt had knocked out first.)
          </p>
          <p>
            When they came to, the fortress was in chaos. The esteemed Tenes
            Knights had been toyed with by a single intruder, and it was only
            with the intervention of a Golden Knight that order was restored.
            All this upheaval caused by just one intruder.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viscount Kelberen was, understandably, furious. He declared that if
            the thief showed up again, they must capture him using the forces of
            the Kelberen domain alone, to restore the knights’ honor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consequently, the already agitated Captain Hotern was even more
            irate. As a result, all defense forces of the Kelberen fortress had
            foregone their days off and were on high alert. Even Viscount
            Kelberen himself was seen tending to his daily duties in full armor.
          </p>
          <p>“I’d never seen Mr. Hotern that angry before.”</p>
          <p>“Me neither, me neither.”</p>
          <p>
            Drain and Kaltan stood upright, only moving their eyes as they
            surveyed those around them. Despite it still being the afternoon,
            over fifty soldiers were stationed at various points along the wall,
            holding spears and swords with furrowed brows, a picture of strict
            discipline.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the true feelings of these sharp-bladed soldiers were less
            ‘We have let our guard down and allowed the enemy through, what a
            disgrace! We shall ensure that outsiders never invade Kelberen
            Castle again!’ and more ‘We are really staying alert here! Please,
            anything but a pay cut!’ In fact, Drain and Kaltan shared a similar
            sentiment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recalling the events of the previous night, Drain sighed. After all,
            Viscount Kelberen had boasted that the soldiers alone would be
            enough to capture the thief…
          </p>
          <p>
            “No way, how could ordinary soldiers like us possibly deal with
            someone who can crush armor and shields with their bare hands just
            by being a bit more alert?”
          </p>
          <p>Kaltan nodded subtly in agreement.</p>
          <p>
            “I really hope we never meet them again… What was that? A monster?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I heard that the thief already stole what they came for. So, maybe
            they won’t come back?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, but this morning, Sir Eusus brought in the thief’s accomplices.
            So, they might come back to rescue their comrades.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “Ugh, I wish they would just knock us out cleanly like last night
            again…”
          </p>
          <p>
            While the soldiers seemed to be in a state of high alert on the
            outside, their conversations painted a different picture. Drain and
            Kaltan, along with the other soldiers, were all sharing similar
            sentiments. If Viscount Kelberen heard them, he would be livid.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Drain and Kaltan were engaging in their lackluster dialogue,
            Kaltan suddenly turned his head in surprise.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            It was a strange sensation he had never felt before, as if something
            was pricking his skin. Drain felt it too and turned his head in the
            same direction.
          </p>
          <p>“What is this chilling feeling?”</p>
          <p>
            Both shivered involuntarily, and they were not alone. Every soldier
            on the wall had turned to look in one direction, just like them.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the edge of the forest near the castle gate, Kaltan let out a
            dazed groan upon setting his eyes on that spot.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah?”</p>
          <p>
            A man emerged from the forest. With brown hair and a robust build,
            golden radiance shimmered around his broad shoulders. The light was
            so intense that, had it not been golden, one might have mistaken the
            man for being on fire.
          </p>
          <p>Drain muttered hesitantly, “Could it be… is that an aura?”</p>
          <p>
            It was an aura user, a being of legends! At that moment, all the
            soldiers on the wall froze, realizing the source of their unsettling
            feeling.
          </p>
          <p>It was an overwhelming presence.</p>
          <p>
            The man, exuding a golden aura, walked towards the castle with
            unmatched confidence. Among the petrified soldiers, one particularly
            brave soul managed to overcome the intimidation and shouted at the
            man.
          </p>
          <p>“Who are you! Identify yourself!”</p>
          <p>The man lifted his head to look at the soldier and smirked.</p>
          <p>“Impressive. I did use a bit too much energy on purpose.”</p>
          <p>
            He slightly bent his knees. Still, the soldiers on the wall could do
            nothing. Despite their training, they could only stare, like frogs
            paralyzed by a snake, unable even to divert their gaze.
          </p>
          <p>In this state, the man murmured softly, “Calamity Horn…”</p>
          <p>
            Despite the quietness of his voice, it was heard clearly.
            Unintentionally, Drain dropped the spear in his hand.
          </p>
          <p>Clang…</p>
          <p>As the spear hit the ground, the man roared and leapt forward.</p>
          <p>“Haap!”</p>
          <p>
            Golden aura rippled through the air. His steel-like physique turned
            into a massive spear, charging forward. A solid fist extended,
            tearing through space and drawing countless waves of light.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man’s punch slammed into the thick gates of Kelberen Castle.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            With a thunderous noise, the stout gates shattered into pieces with
            a single blow. Fragments flew into the air. But that was not all.
            Four dazzling waves of golden light converged into one point,
            pulling in the surrounding air. A horrifying shockwave scraped the
            ground, shaking it as if an earthquake had erupted. The walls,
            constructed by dwarves to stand unyielded for a millennium, cracked.
          </p>
          <p>
            A moment of silence, then the walls crumbled with a deafening roar.
          </p>
          <p>Rumble!</p>
          <p>
            Experiencing the ground shaking under one’s feet is not something
            easily forgotten. Finally, the soldiers began to scream and
            collapse.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaah!”</p>

          <p>
            Billowing clouds of dust rose up, as if part of Viscount Kelberen’s
            castle had transformed into a cloud. The enormous amount of dust
            spread in all directions, a natural consequence of bringing down an
            entire section of the castle wall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking atop the rubble of the collapsed wall, Repenhardt couldn’t
            help but smirk wryly.
          </p>
          <p>“Did I go a bit too far?”</p>
          <p>
            Still, it seemed that no one was seriously injured. Although it
            might have appeared brutish, Repenhardt had specifically targeted a
            section where guards were not present to unleash his Calamity Horn.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had already extended his Sense Realm to check. There were
            definitively no soldiers crushed under the debris. Most of the
            soldiers were simply sitting atop the shaking walls, frozen in
            terror. A few had rolled down below, breaking legs or sustaining
            other injuries, but such wounds would heal with proper rest.
          </p>
          <p>“This should keep them dazed for a while.”</p>
          <p>
            With this, the soldiers within the territory of Viscount Kelberen
            could be considered dealt with. They were too shocked to dare make a
            move for some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Destroying walls entirely to break the morale of soldiers was a
            tactic Repenhardt had often used in his past life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Walls are unlike ordinary buildings. They are perceived almost like
            mountains or cliffs, believed to never fall. To any person of sound
            mind, maintaining their sanity in the face of such a wall
            disappearing before their eyes would be challenging. Even if they
            were unharmed, witnessing such large-scale destruction typically
            leaves one in shock.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaving the demoralized soldiers behind, Repenhardt walked towards
            the inner part of Kelberen. He saw dozens of armed knights pouring
            out from the inner keep’s corridors. They were from the Tenes Knight
            Order. Following them, a group of robed figures and men in clerical
            garb rushed out. These were the mages contracted with the Tenes
            family and the priests of Aerius, the Sky Goddess.
          </p>
          <p>
            The knights surrounded Repenhardt with practiced movements, while
            the mages and priests positioned themselves to form a semicircle. As
            the formation was set, one of the knights yelled at Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“You brazen villain! You dare show your face again!”</p>
          <p>
            Although he wore a mask the previous night, recognizing Repenhardt
            was not difficult. He might not be a giant of unprecedented size
            like Gerard, but Repenhardt’s stature was also rare to behold. All
            knights were convinced he was the thief from the night before. Of
            course, Repenhardt had no intention of denying it.
          </p>
          <p>Surrounding him, Repenhardt opened his mouth.</p>
          <p>“I’ve heard my companions are here?”</p>
          <p>It was a leisurely voice. The knight, Lento, shouted in anger.</p>
          <p>“How dare you disrespect the Tenes Knights!”</p>
          <p>
            The thief from the previous night, surrounded by the Tenes Knights,
            did not show a trace of tension on his face. Moreover, despite
            coming to rescue his companion, he showed no hurry at all. Casually
            blasting through the walls and sauntering over leisurely?
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘How lightly must he be taking the Tenes Knights to act so
            nonchalantly?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Waves of anger spread among the knights. Of course, they were aware
            that their opponent was an Aura user. Honestly, they were terrified
            by the tremendous might of bringing down the walls. However, the
            Tenes Knights were not so insignificant to be disrespected to this
            extent!
          </p>
          <p>The vice-captain, Sir Lot, drew his sword and shouted.</p>
          <p>“Knights of Tenes! Show this arrogant fool your strength!”</p>

          <p>
            The knights uniformly drew their swords. With precise posture, the
            entire knight order moved as if they were a single organism. The
            magicians and clerics also took their positions without a single
            gap, backing them up. Sir Lot continued with a confident voice,
          </p>
          <p>“It won’t be like last night!”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt nodded absently.</p>
          <p>“Indeed, it will be different from last night.”</p>
          <p>
            Since they had sneaked in yesterday, one couldn’t really say the
            Tenes Knights had properly responded. Everyone was relaxed after
            finishing a tough expedition, and having just fought a demon that
            suddenly appeared within the castle, nobody expected another
            incident so soon, hence they were not fully equipped to face
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, the Tenes Knights now were alert and fully
            concentrated, ready to unleash 100 percent of their power. It was
            understandable why Sir Lot was so confident.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the situation was different for him as well. Taking a
            stance, Repenhardt showed a bitter smile.
          </p>
          <p>“…I, too, will be a bit different from last night.”</p>
          <p>“Lento! Baras! Go!”</p>
          <p>“Yes! Vice-captain!”</p>
          <p>
            Following Sir Lot’s command, two knights charged at Repenhardt with
            their shields ahead. The unique shield charge of the heavily armored
            knights, hiding their swords behind the shields, would have been
            effective enough if the opponent were an ordinary warrior.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt remained unaffected. Standing in place, he
            lowered his stance and delivered a series of heavy punches towards
            the charging shields. As if they had anticipated this, both knights
            raised their shields to block in front.
          </p>
          <p>Boom! Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Two explosions sounded. The bodies of the two knights were launched
            into the air. Screams erupted.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            It was different from yesterday. They had expected that blocking
            with their shields would be useless. They were prepared to be sent
            flying with their shields. Thus, both were ready to roll on the
            ground and get back up immediately, as such occurrences were common
            during their demon battles in ruins exploration.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this time, something was different. The shields crumpled, and an
            intense shockwave traveled up their bodies. It was as if they had
            been hit directly, twisting their insides and causing severe pain.
          </p>
          <p>“Cough!”</p>
          <p>
            Flung away, Lento and Baras coughed up blood as they tumbled on the
            ground. A single strike, even though it was blocked by the shields,
            had rendered their bodies immobile from the shock.
          </p>
          <p>
            Caught off guard by the unexpected development, Sir Lot looked at
            Repenhardt in confusion.
          </p>
          <p>‘What kind of trick did he pull?’</p>
          <p>Repenhardt retracted his fist and smirked.</p>

          <p>
            “I’ve already shown you this trick yesterday. To fall for it again
            would be truly foolish.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, Gym Unbreakable’s strikes always carry Aura waves,
            ensuring that even if the attack is blocked, the shock passes
            through the opponent’s body, rendering any armor useless. He had
            refrained from using Aura last night to conceal his presence, but
            now he could use it without restraint.
          </p>
          <p>“Gah! Selpid! Lakan! Ernesto!”</p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot sent another trio of knights charging. Leaving the fallen
            two behind, three other knights launched a follow-up attack.
          </p>
          <p>“How dare you do that to Lento!”</p>
          <p>“You villain!”</p>
          <p>“Die!”</p>
          <p>
            With generic battle cries, the knights aimed their swords at
            Repenhardt from the left, right, and rear simultaneously. Once
            again, Repenhardt swung his arms to parry the attacks, inserting
            Aura-charged kicks simultaneously to strike the knights. A proper
            side kick sent the knights tumbling again.
          </p>
          <p>“Aagh!”</p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>“Owowow!”</p>
          <p>
            Once more, all three knights screamed as they fell. They hadn’t
            allowed the attacks through lack of skill. When it became impossible
            to dodge as usual, they cleverly twisted their bodies to take the
            hits on the thicker parts of their armor. However, the subsequent
            shockwaves from the Aura waves could not be blocked by armor.
          </p>
          <p>“This, this is…”</p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot was taken aback. The situation was unforeseen. The Tenes
            Knights’ distinctive tactic of pressuring opponents with their
            armored bodies was entirely ineffective.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the dismay did not last long. The Tenes Knights had battled
            numerous demons. They were not so weak as to be deterred by this!
          </p>
          <p>Quickly regaining his composure, Sir Lot raised his right hand.</p>
          <p>“Priests! Bless their flesh, not their armor!”</p>
          <p>
            The clerics strained their divine power, pouring blessings onto the
            knights. Instead of reinforcing the armor, they recited sacred
            spells that enhanced the physical resilience of the knights
            themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Aerius! Bestow your blessing upon your servants so their bodies may
            stand firm as rock!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The knights, significantly fortified, charged in unison. Following
            them, the mages in the rear ranks began to chant in unison.
          </p>
          <p>“Blades of frost, come forth before me! Ice Bolt!”</p>
          <p>
            “Conflagration, come to my hand to strike down the foe! Flame
            Arrow!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ra Filt Krel Asor, storm of thunder, blow forth! Lightning Storm!”
          </p>

          <p>
            Between the knights’ assaults, a storm of various magics flew
            towards their target. If it had been only the knights’ attacks,
            Repenhardt might have managed, but the addition of spells made
            timing difficult. Dodging swinging blades and occasionally
            deflecting them, Repenhardt eyed the mages standing at a distance.
          </p>
          <p>‘The mages must be dealt with first.’</p>
          <p>
            In an instant, Repenhardt rolled on the ground and propelled himself
            into the air. The towering figure of 190 centimeters quickly leaped
            over the heads of the knights, rushing towards the mages. The
            startled mages stumbled backward, hastily reciting spells.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah! Ra Tilt Del……”</p>
          <p>“Winds of frost……”</p>
          <p>
            Slipping through the mages attempting to form their incantations,
            Repenhardt thrust his fists in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>“Series of Aura Bullets!”</p>
          <p>
            Golden Aura bullets precisely struck the mages’ legs in succession.
            The spells were utterly disrupted, and the mages simultaneously
            clutched their legs, screaming in agony. The Aura bullets fired by
            Repenhardt had completely shattered their legs.
          </p>
          <p>“Agghhh!”</p>
          <p>“My leg!”</p>
          <p>“Such a vile fiend!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt flashed a smirk at the sight of the mages writhing in
            pain on the dirt ground.
          </p>
          <p>‘This is the level of mages here, huh.’</p>
          <p>
            Having been a mage in his previous life, he knew well how to
            neutralize them. Even he, a grand sorcerer, would see his
            concentration plummet and his ability to cast spells severely
            limited with even a single injury back in his prime. It was
            impossible for these average mages to recite spells properly with
            broken legs.
          </p>
          <p>‘I thought at least one or two would show some guts…’</p>
          <p>
            With a slightly disappointed face, Repenhardt looked at the fallen
            mages. All were merely groaning, none overcoming their pain to cast
            spells. To him, once a grand sorcerer, they all seemed pathetic.
          </p>
          <p>‘Tsk tsk, to walk the path of magic with such a spirit…’</p>
          <p>
            He wondered if this was how a senior felt looking at his unworthy
            juniors.
          </p>
          <p>‘Wait, these were my seniors, technically speaking.’</p>
          <p>
            With a wry smile, Repenhardt turned around. The knights were
            furiously charging at him.
          </p>
          <p>“Fallen mages!”</p>
          <p>“Geldt! Pjarn! Damn it, are they all down!”</p>
          <p>
            They were grinding their teeth. Their enemy had just leaped over a
            distance of more than 20 meters in a blink, laying all the mages low
            without giving them a chance to react. Losing their magical force so
            pathetically was an unprecedented disgrace in the history of the
            Tenes Knights. They were all filled with rage, charging like angry
            bulls.
          </p>
          <p>‘Now, what’s next…’</p>
          <p>
            But Repenhardt paid no attention to their anger. His next targets
            were the ones in blue clerical robes standing behind the knights.
          </p>
          <p>‘Maybe it’s time to deal with the clerics…’</p>
          <p>
            Once again, Repenhardt launched himself into the air. His form
            soared over the heads of the knights once more. All the knights felt
            the bitter sting of frustration, grinding their teeth in vain.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>
            The biggest difference between an Aura user and an ordinary knight
            was this: the gap in physical abilities was simply too vast. When
            one person is painstakingly running on two feet, another is rolling
            a single time to cover distances of 20 to 30 meters, making it
            utterly impossible to keep up.

          <p>Chapter 64</p>
          <p>
            “If you’re an Aura user, face me fair and square! What kind of
            cowardly act is this?”
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the knights exclaimed indignantly. Repenhardt just flicked
            his tongue out dismissively, ignoring the comment.
          </p>
          <p>‘Fair and square, when they’re all ganging up on one?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, having once again soared through the air to create
            distance, now landed in front of the priests of Aerius. The priests,
            having witnessed the mages being overpowered, each began their
            prayers, drawing forth protective barriers.
          </p>
          <p>“O Aerius…”</p>
          <p>“Grace us with the protection of the skies for your servants!”</p>
          <p>
            They wrapped themselves in a blue halo of defense, especially
            concentrated around their legs, in anticipation of Repenhardt’s
            energy blasts.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt had no intention of using the same tactic again.
          </p>
          <p>‘It seems I can’t deal with priests the same way as mages.’</p>
          <p>
            If he intended to kill, there wouldn’t be much difference, but to
            subdue them without endangering their lives, the approach to mages
            and priests had to be entirely different. Mages could be neutralized
            through pain from injuries, but priests were not so easily dealt
            with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Divine spells were not about concocting spell formulas in the mind
            to perform miracles, like a mage would. Priests call out to their
            deity from their hearts to manifest miracles into reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, sometimes, the more a priest is injured, the stronger their
            divine spells become.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a simple principle. Who would be more sincere in their pleas
            for salvation, someone unharmed or someone severely injured?
          </p>
          <p>‘That’s why priests need to be subdued without injuries.’</p>
          <p>
            As soon as Repenhardt landed, he charged forward. The priests,
            expecting a golden projectile, flinched at the surprise, but
            Repenhardt suddenly reached out. His thick fingers broke through the
            halo of light and grasped the throat of a middle-aged priest.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            The priest struggled for a moment before going limp. The other
            priests were horrified.
          </p>
          <p>“Priest Hator!”</p>
          <p>“Such a brutal man! Strangling someone to death!”</p>
          <p>
            In reality, Repenhardt had precisely pressed the carotid artery to
            cut off blood flow to the brain, causing unconsciousness. But there
            was no time to explain, and Repenhardt rushed towards another
            priest. This one seemed to have some hand-to-hand combat skills and
            threw punches that appeared somewhat decent.
          </p>
          <p>“Yah!”</p>
          <p>
            But to Repenhardt, trained by the best fist fighter on the
            continent, it was child’s play.
          </p>
          <p>“Ucha~!”</p>
          <p>
            Easily deflecting the punch, Repenhardt instead used the opponent’s
            forearm to choke him. The priest’s complexion turned pale, and he
            soon passed out.
          </p>
          <p>“Kekeke…”</p>
          <p>
            Thus, Repenhardt went from one priest to another, kindly applying
            chokeholds. Unlike with the mages, this was a time-consuming task,
            and soon enough, knights joined the fray, attacking Repenhardt
            earnestly…
          </p>

          <p>“Cough, cough! Please, spare me!”</p>
          <p>“This villain! Release Priest Lahan!”</p>
          <p>“Cough, cough! He’s choking me…”</p>
          <p>“Priest Smard!”</p>
          <p>
            Even as the knights’ attacks poured down on him, Repenhardt
            skillfully dodged and rendered each priest unconscious. With both
            the mages and the priests defeated, Knight Lot was furiously
            shouting orders.
          </p>
          <p>“Throw the net! Throw the net!”</p>
          <p>
            But a net made of iron chains was easily caught and torn apart by
            Repenhardt’s bare hands.
          </p>
          <p>“Crossbow! Shoot him with the crossbow!”</p>
          <p>
            Even crossbow bolts, capable of piercing steel, were effortlessly
            deflected by the swirling aura around Repenhardt’s body. From the
            moment the aura manifested, it was clear that Repenhardt found such
            attempts hardly bothersome. Knight Lot yelled with a voice that
            sounded like he was about to cry.
          </p>
          <p>“Everyone attack! You are the honorable knights of Tenes!”</p>
          <p>
            Only about a third of the knights remained standing, a number
            rapidly diminishing. With a look of despair, the knights charged for
            one last attempt.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaahhh!”</p>
          <p>But the outcome was disastrous.</p>
          <p>“Haap!”</p>
          <p>
            With a light shout, Repenhardt soared into the air, immediately
            striking the head of the lead knight and using the recoil to perform
            side kicks to the left and right, followed by a backhand strike to
            another knight, and then, upon landing, a sweeping kick that took
            down three more. Moving through the knights with the speed of an
            eagle preying and the strength of a bear, Repenhardt’s attacks left
            seven knights groaning on the ground. Now, without the protection of
            the priests, one hit meant the end. They would not rise again. A
            murmur spread among the remaining knights.
          </p>
          <p>“What, what is this?”</p>
          <p>“This is nothing like yesterday!”</p>
          <p>
            At this point, even the spirit of the world-renowned Tenes knights
            was broken. Knight Lot murmured in a dazed voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Is this… the power of a ‘real’ Aura user…”</p>
          <p>
            He gloomily counted the number of knights left standing. Now, fewer
            than five remained. As Knight Lot looked at the faces of the
            remaining knights, his expression suddenly hardened.
          </p>
          <p>“Russ, that bastard!”</p>
          <p>
            Among the remaining knights, he saw Russ, who was just standing
            there, dumbly observing the situation. Shocked, Knight Lot shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Russ! What are you doing?”</p>
          <p>
            But Russ showed no reaction, as if he couldn’t hear Knight Lot at
            all, just staring blankly with his mouth open at his falling
            comrades.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘What’s with that guy? Usually, he can’t wait to jump into action
            even when told to stay put, and now, when he should be moving, he’s
            frozen like a statue?’
          </p>
          <p>
            However, now was not the time to deal with insubordination. Drawing
            his sword, Knight Lot gritted his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I’ll have him expelled. Once we return to the clan, I’ll make sure
            he’s expelled!’
          </p>

          <p>With a battle cry, Knight Lot charged towards Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>‘Ah…’</p>
          <p>
            Russ watched as his comrades fell one by one. The honorable knights,
            who had undergone rigorous training, were being knocked down as if
            they were mere foot soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Russ felt no anger at this sight. Unlike his fellow knights, he
            could not bring himself to charge at the enemy. Instead, he stood
            there, his sword hanging limply by his side, rooted to the spot in a
            daze.
          </p>
          <p>‘So, this is it…’</p>
          <p>
            The movement he had always yearned for but had never been able to
            grasp was unfolding before his eyes. Every step, punch, and kick
            contained an astonishingly intricate movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            And within all these movements, there was a brilliant light. A light
            that guided the flow of power, sometimes amplifying it, sometimes
            flowing with it.
          </p>
          <p>‘Aura…’</p>
          <p>
            Although the realms of fist and sword were different, Russ was
            witnessing a true Aura user’s combat for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>He could see everything.</p>
          <p>
            Why each movement was made, why the power flowed in such a way –
            everything was crystal clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            The true essence of martial arts that no one had taught him, that no
            one could teach him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The true movement, breath, and flow that only those who have reached
            the pinnacle of martial arts could perform.
          </p>
          <p>Without realizing it, Russ let out a sigh of admiration.</p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>Now he understood what he had been lacking.</p>
          <p>Russ’s fingers twitched, and his arm muscles faintly vibrated.</p>
          <p>‘So, that’s how you’re supposed to move.’</p>
          <p>
            It was an epiphany. Like a dam bursting, the sensations that had
            been swirling in his mind for ten years of wielding his sword, yet
            remaining elusive, were now flooding through his body like a tidal
            wave.
          </p>
          <p>‘That is true movement…’</p>
          <p>
            Russ unconsciously raised his sword. As he slightly lifted his long
            sword, a faint blue light began to emanate from its tip.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a powerful shout, Knight Lot thrust his bastard sword deeply in
            front of Repenhardt. The strike was flawless in speed, angle, and
            timing. Compared to the other knights, his skill was exceptional,
            demonstrating not only his competence but also a strong sense of
            duty and patience as a commander. A more impulsive person would have
            abandoned their post and joined the fray long ago.
          </p>
          <p>‘He is truly worthy of being the deputy to the Golden Knight…’</p>
          <p>
            But to Repenhardt, an Aura user, such distinctions mattered little.
            He calmly sensed the incoming sword strike and smoothly twisted his
            body to avoid it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dodging the attack, Repenhardt extended his right leg for a counter
            uppercut! The punch, filled with Aura, crushed Knight Lot’s
            abdominal armor and surged powerfully upwards.
          </p>

          <p>
            With a single blow, Knight Lot was launched into the air. Despite
            his considerable height and muscled physique, not to mention the
            heavy armor he wore, he floated up as if he were a balloon.
          </p>
          <p>“Kugh…”</p>
          <p>
            Even amidst severe pain, Knight Lot managed only a short groan,
            attempting to regain his posture. The shockwave had penetrated even
            through the armor, feeling almost like a direct hit to his bare
            body, yet he remarkably didn’t lose consciousness. He even showed
            the spirit to swing his sword again in that state.
          </p>
          <p>‘Huh? He didn’t pass out?’</p>
          <p>
            Even while being flung through the air, not losing the spirit to
            attack was truly exemplary of a warrior. Was it his formidable
            spirit? Slightly admiring him, Repenhardt twisted his head to dodge
            the sword strike and then extended a long right straight.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            Just as the lightning-fast right straight was about to strike Knight
            Lot, who was suspended in mid-air, Repenhardt swiftly retracted his
            fist and shot back.
          </p>
          <p>Kwaang!</p>
          <p>
            Timed perfectly, a thick column of lightning struck the spot where
            he had just been standing. The air boiled as if struck by lightning,
            and countless electric serpents writhed on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was instantly recognizable: a 5th Circle Lightning Spell,
            Electric Spear.
          </p>
          <p>“So you’ve finally shown yourself?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt turned with a grin. As expected, atop the rampart above,
            a knight clad in golden armor was glaring at him with a stern face,
            sword aimed in his direction.
          </p>
          <p>The knight, Eusus, yelled with a voice filled with anger.</p>
          <p>
            “In the name of Tenes, I will not forgive any more of your barbaric
            acts!”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot groaned, lifting his head. His expression was a mix of
            relief and resentment.
          </p>
          <p>“What took you so long to arrive?”</p>
          <p>
            While he was grateful for being saved in the nick of time, the
            damage to the Tenes Knights was near catastrophic. Had he arrived
            just a bit earlier, this could have been avoided.
          </p>
          <p>
            The remaining knights looked as if they were about to cry, shouting
            the name of Eusus.
          </p>
          <p>“Sir Eusus!”</p>
          <p>“Lord Eusus!”</p>
          <p>“You’ve come!”</p>
          <p>
            Without a word, Eusus slowly walked towards Repenhardt. As he
            surveyed the surroundings, his expression grew increasingly grim.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though there were no fatalities, the sight of the Tenes Knights
            scattered around was truly horrific. The mages, groaning on the
            ground, seemed to be in better condition. Most of the knights and
            priests were completely unconscious, unable to even groan.
          </p>
          <p>In a low voice, Eusus spoke.</p>
          <p>“…You’ve made quite a mess of my knights.”</p>
          <p>
            His voice carried a clear anger, befitting of a leader who had seen
            his subordinates in such a dismal state. However, Repenhardt didn’t
            seem to sympathize much. Staring intently at Eusus, he suddenly
            snorted.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph! Acting like you’ve just arrived? You’ve been behind there all
            along, haven’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s expression briefly flashed with surprise. Repenhardt pointed
            out, rather helpfully,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Over there, behind that wall. You’ve been squatting and watching
            since a while ago, haven’t you? Did you think I wouldn’t notice?”
          </p>
          <p>‘How did he know?’</p>
          <p>
            Eusus was flustered. Indeed, he had arrived at the scene right after
            the battle had started and had been secretly observing the
            situation. But he was no fool. He knew aura users could sense beyond
            what was visible, including him. He had even cast a special magic to
            block his presence. He wondered how this man had noticed him.

          <p>Chapter 65</p>
          <p>
            Eusus was flustered. In reality, he had arrived at the scene just
            after the battle had begun. It was true that he had been hiding and
            observing the situation. However, he was no fool. He was aware that
            aura users could sense beyond what was visible with their sense of
            perception. Thus, he had taken ample precautions.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘So I even cast a spell specifically to block my presence, how did
            this person know about that?’
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, it wasn’t sensed through aura, that’s why.’</p>
          <p>
            Seeing Eusus flustered, Repenhardt chuckled to himself. Indeed, his
            sense of perception had not detected Eusus. Just as in the
            Principality of Chatan, where Sillan had deceived Lantas’s senses, a
            powerful magical protection or a divine spell could fool an aura
            user’s senses.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt possessed not only a keen sense of perception
            but also an exceptional ability to detect magical energy. It was
            clear that, although the physical presence was undetectable, the
            magic of invisibility was slowly leaking out. If he couldn’t sense
            that, he might as well return the title of Demon King from his
            previous life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, Repenhardt had a good guess as to why Eusus had resorted
            to such a tactic.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You wanted to test my skills, didn’t you? But to throw all your
            knights into the experiment just for that, isn’t that a bit too
            much, don’t you think?”
          </p>
          <p>Eusus’s face hardened.</p>
          <p>
            It was true. Initially, he had planned to jump out immediately.
            However, seeing the collapsed city wall changed his mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thief’s skills were entirely different from last night. He
            didn’t know why, but unlike yesterday, he was openly using the power
            of aura. Moreover, it was a golden aura, easily recognizable.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was only one martial art in the vast continent that used a
            golden aura. At least, that pilgrim boy had told one truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The successor of Gym Unbreakable, the esteemed Fist King Gerard’s
            disciple; he couldn’t guarantee victory even with Eldrad’s power,
            but it was a battle he could not afford to lose. He had to overpower
            the opponent to retrieve the relic.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, after much deliberation, Eusus abandoned his men. In a true
            battle between the strong, ordinary knights had no place. Facing a
            proper aura user, the knights would only be a hindrance. Thus,
            observing the opponent’s battle to gain more information was deemed
            a better strategy for winning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Judging by the odds alone, Eusus’s decision was correct. However, it
            was also true that such an act was considered despicable, something
            the renowned Golden Knight should never resort to.
          </p>
          <p>
            “People say you’re a knight of great light and justice, but you’ve
            got quite the cunning side, haven’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>“Uh, umm…”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus could only groan in response to Repenhardt’s mocking. He
            hadn’t thought he’d be discovered, and at that moment, he couldn’t
            think of a retort.
          </p>
          <p>
            As if to drive the point home, Repenhardt posed another question.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Or why on earth did you show up so late? You would have been here
            sooner even if you had been rolling around naked with a woman.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus von Tenes was left speechless, and the expressions of the
            Tenes Knights gradually turned stern.
          </p>
          <p>“Could it be…”</p>
          <p>“There’s no way Lord Eusus would…”</p>

          <p>
            The murmurings of his subordinates were clearly audible. As
            suspicion and distrust grew in their eyes, Eusus tried to maintain
            his composure and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I accidentally fell asleep due to exhaustion. That’s why I didn’t
            wake up on time!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You’re saying you didn’t wake up even with the walls being smashed?
            Are you some kind of Sleeping Beauty knight?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The noise from the collapsing walls was one thing, but it felt like
            an earthquake, shaking the ground. Even if he was soundly asleep in
            bed, he would have rolled off from the impact.
          </p>
          <p>“Quiet, you scoundrel!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus roared, the distrust among the knights growing stronger. He
            couldn’t let him continue talking, or dishonorable stories might
            start to spread. He needed to silence the other party.
          </p>
          <p>“I will question you for tarnishing the name of Tenes!”</p>
          <p>Wielding the magic sword Eldran, Eusus soared into the air.</p>
          <p>“Blade of the sky, tear through the void!”</p>
          <p>
            Swinging his sword, Eusus chanted. Blades of wind targeted
            Repenhardt as he lowered his stance and burst out.
          </p>
          <p>“Haap!”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, a golden storm exploded from his entire body, engulfing
            all the blades of wind in the air and dissipating them. He could
            dispel magic with merely the manifestation of his aura? Grinding his
            teeth, Eusus continued his outcry.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Eyes of Death, piercing through shadows, the roar of a leopard,
            dwelling in limbs! With the senses of a dragon, I shall oversee the
            world!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Facing the enhanced Eusus, Repenhardt quickly lunged forward,
            launching a magnificent spinning kick. Eusus easily avoided the
            attack by leaping back. Repenhardt’s eyes gleamed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s good to dodge, but you shouldn’t fly into the air like that!”
          </p>
          <p>
            How much blood had he seen spilled when he sparred with Gerard doing
            just that? With a triumphant smile, Repenhardt prepared for a
            follow-up, leveraging his momentum for a long swing.
          </p>
          <p>“I shall become a feather, riding the wind!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus kicked off the air, launching himself again. This caused the
            timing to miss, and the punch hit nothing but air.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, that’s right, the fellow can use magic, too.’</p>
          <p>
            Using the 4th circle spell, Wind Walk, one could leap off the air
            again. Of course, it required a high sense of balance, so magicians
            only used it to slow their fall, but it was a spell highly favored
            by skilled magic swordsmen.
          </p>
          <p>‘Damn, Siris used it well too, why didn’t I think of that?’</p>
          <p>
            Having landed back on the ground, Repenhardt took his stance. Eusus,
            keeping a distance, glared at him, grinding his teeth. Feeling the
            overt hostility, Repenhardt clicked his tongue. Had he been too
            sarcastic? The anger was evident.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, I didn’t really mean to criticize.’</p>
          <p>
            But looking at what he was doing, irritation swelled up unwittingly,
            scratching his temper.
          </p>

          <p>‘But still, why such an overreaction, this guy?’</p>
          <p>
            Truthfully, the technique of manipulating the Voice of Elucion was
            known only to Repenhardt. In his previous life, quite a few people
            were aware of it, but it was he who researched and presented the
            method at the magicians’ conference, so there was no one in this era
            who would know.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, for the von Tenes family, the Voice of Elucion was
            just one of the unidentified relics from the Silver Age. Even if it
            were lost, there would be no problem at all. Thus, Repenhardt
            planned to steal it without much guilt.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the expression on Eusus’s face was as if Repenhardt had run off
            with a treasure of the von Tenes family, showing an extreme
            reaction. Frankly, it was somewhat incomprehensible.
          </p>
          <p>‘Not that a thief has any right to say this…’</p>
          <p>
            With a bitter smile, Repenhardt looked at Eusus. Eusus also stared
            straight at Repenhardt. As they eyed each other, assessing the
            situation, Eusus stretched out Eldran and chanted a spell.
          </p>
          <p>“Flow of purity that constitutes the world, come to my sword!”</p>
          <p>
            A dazzling white energy enveloped the blade of the magic sword
            Eldran. Reading the magical pattern emanating from the sword,
            Repenhardt frowned.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘A pure magic sword, an Arcane Blade, huh? With that, it can
            certainly confront aura.’
          </p>
          <p>
            In his past life, that was the magic he most frequently used to
            counter the swords of aura users. Of course, Repenhardt had not
            wielded it directly but had mixed it with an automatic response
            spell, floating it in mid-air to make offense and defense possible
            on its own.
          </p>
          <p>“Ha!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus dashed, closing the distance between them. The Arcane Blade
            scattered dozens of sword lights into the air. From all directions,
            powerful destructive energies flew at speeds beyond human limits.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a body strengthened to the limit by the magical armor Eldrad,
            the Arcane Blade wielded could not be underestimated, even by
            Repenhardt. Retreating, he dodged the attacks continuously.
          </p>
          <p>Swoosh!</p>
          <p>
            In the midst of the relentless assault, the Arcane Blade merely
            grazed Repenhardt’s chest. He furrowed his brows momentarily. Though
            it was just the skin, he could definitely feel that he was cut. This
            was not his normal state; his entire body was enhanced with aura to
            be stronger than steel, yet he was wounded. Glancing down, he saw a
            trickle of blood seeping into his garment over his chest.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Indeed, it seems one cannot block an Arcane Blade with physical
            strength alone.’
          </p>
          <p>“Die!”</p>
          <p>
            With a voice full of murderous intent, Eusus slashed his sword down
            again. This time, Repenhardt lifted his forearm to block the attack,
            summoning his aura and adding a fierce spin to it.
          </p>
          <p>“Spiral Guard!”</p>
          <p>
            This was the strongest defense technique of Gym Unbreakable ― or
            rather, it was actually the only defensive technique. The philosophy
            of the martial art was such that most attacks could simply be
            endured with the body ― and Repenhardt carefully intercepted the
            attack. He was also ready to swiftly pull his arm back if it proved
            ineffective.
          </p>
          <p>Crackle!</p>
          <p>
            The blade and the spinning aura collided, emitting a chilling noise.
            Repenhardt smiled slightly.
          </p>
          <p>‘This works.’</p>

          <p>
            If his forearm, imbued with Spiral Guard, could withstand the Arcane
            Blade, it meant it could also block a blade’s aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            With newfound confidence, Repenhardt wrapped both forearms with
            Spiral Guard and successively blocked the onslaught. While
            defending, he gradually began to counterattack. Dozens of exchanges
            between the two ensued, with white sword light and golden aura
            clashing, rending the air with deafening roars.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt began to press his counterattack, Eusus appeared to be
            momentarily gaining the upper hand but was gradually pushed back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moving his limbs, Repenhardt momentarily glanced beyond the inner
            sanctum towards the heart of Viscount Kelberen’s castle. Observing
            the large fortress with fires blazing here and there, he murmured to
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>‘I wonder how Tilla is doing.’</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            In the dimly lit underground dungeon, illuminated only by a small
            bonfire, Sillan and Siris were having their belated lunch. Despite
            being shackled in chains, their treatment wasn’t as bad as one might
            expect. Thanks to Sillan’s constant blabbering, they were spared
            from torture, and it became known among the knights that they were
            merely scapegoats. Perceived as innocent children caught in the
            crossfire, they were not harassed and were even provided with decent
            meals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dipping bread into soup, Sillan asked Siris, “What could it have
            been?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The event in question had occurred roughly ten minutes prior. They
            were idly rolling around on the bed when suddenly, a loud rumble,
            akin to an earthquake, echoed through the ground, audible even in
            the depths of this windowless underground dungeon.
          </p>
          <p>“Could it have been a volcanic eruption somewhere?”</p>
          <p>
            However, they had never heard of any active volcanoes in the
            Setellad mountain range. Even when they inquired with the guard at
            the prison door, they received nothing but a command to stay quiet.
          </p>
          <p>Ceasing her bread-tearing, Siris tilted her head in thought.</p>
          <p>“Could it be that Lord Repenhardt has come to rescue us?”</p>
          <p>
            “Huh? You seem unexpectedly sure he would come to save us, given
            your usual standoffish attitude towards him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            While Sillan appeared surprised by her quick response, Siris
            stuttered for a moment before sighing and fiddling with her fingers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know… about Lord Repenhardt. Why he treats me so kindly.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan’s blunt comment, “Just because he’s an elf maniac?” left
            Siris momentarily dazed. Their comradeship seemed surprisingly harsh
            in its frankness.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Initially, I thought he was just someone lost in role-playing,”
            Siris admitted.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It does seem a bit like that, doesn’t it?” Sillan chuckled, and
            Siris shook her head.
          </p>
          <p>“But those eyes…”</p>
          <p>
            The distant gaze he sometimes showed her, laden with deep emotions,
            plunged her into confusion. That gaze, reminiscent of the profound
            affection her parents showed her in her earliest memories, was hard
            to dismiss as merely superficial.
          </p>
          <p>“It doesn’t seem to be for such a simple reason.”</p>
          <p>
            Observing Siris whisper quietly, Sillan nodded as if understanding.
          </p>
          <p>“Indeed, it’s common for women to fall for men like that.”</p>
          <p>“Excuse me?”</p>
          <p>
            “The idea that if someone treats them well, there must be something
            more, that they’re different, special in some way. And then, after
            getting married, they realize they’ve been duped, crying out ‘I was
            fooled by this bastard!’ That’s what the nun at the orphanage I grew
            up in used to say.”
          </p>
          <p>“Is that so?”</p>
          <p>
            With a stunned expression, Siris looked at Sillan. What kind of
            tumultuous past did that orphanage nun have to harbor such a cynical
            worldview? Siris couldn’t help but wonder.

          <p>[ Chapter 66 ]</p>
          <p>
            After slurping down the soup, Sillan flopped down with a sigh and
            grumbled to himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Really, Mr. Repen. If you’re going to steal, at least do it well.
            Why did Siris and I have to end up in this mess because of getting
            caught?”
          </p>
          <p>“But you don’t seem to blame Repenhardt, do you?”</p>
          <p>
            He was supposedly a cleric. It was odd how Sillan didn’t seem to
            care much about being tangled in the crime of theft and ending up in
            jail, even though he served a deity.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, I was complicit in the theft from the moment I agreed to it.
            It’s also my fault for not stopping it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan smirked, suggesting that his feelings might have been
            different had they been tortured. He understood that Repenhardt
            wasn’t the type to covet others’ possessions, so there was no
            particular reason to hold a grudge.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There are times in life when you can’t strictly abide by the law.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, the teachings of Philanence weren’t particularly concerned
            with legal and moral standards. The forms of love it acknowledged
            included affairs and homosexuality, among other things not accepted
            by secular law. Therefore, the clerics of Philanence tended to have
            a slightly loose sense of morality.
          </p>
          <p>Siris widened her eyes in surprise.</p>
          <p>“You’re more mature than you look, Sillan.”</p>
          <p>
            “Hey, I’m not that young. I’ll be twenty next year. I’m only three
            years younger than Mr. Repen.”
          </p>
          <p>“What! I thought you were at least twenty years younger?”</p>
          <p>“…Hey, Mr. Repen would cry if he heard that…”</p>
          <p>
            Despite being imprisoned, the two of them were carelessly enjoying
            their time. They were in the midst of their idle chat when suddenly
            a gruff voice of a guard was heard from outside.
          </p>
          <p>“What? A slave daring to come here?”</p>
          <p>Immediately after, there was a thud followed by a groan.</p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>Sillan and Siris looked at each other with wide eyes.</p>
          <p>“What was that?”</p>
          <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
          <p>
            Shortly after, the sound of a key turning and a door unlocking was
            heard. The prison door swung open, and a pretty young girl peeked
            in.
          </p>
          <p>“Hello. Are you Sillan and Miss Siris?”</p>
          <p>
            The two nodded bewilderedly, sensing the truth in her words. The
            girl, Tilla, smiled brightly and continued.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m Tilla. I’m an assistant to Repenhardt.”</p>

          <p>Sillan and Siris blinked at Tilla. She hurriedly added,</p>
          <p>“We can talk more later. For now, we need to escape.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Climbing up the circular stone staircase, Sillan and Siris followed
            the girl who introduced herself as Tilla.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your belongings seem to have been stored separately upstairs. We
            should find them first, shouldn’t we?”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Even as they followed, Siris couldn’t hide her bewilderment. The
            small girl leading the way, about the same size as Sillan, seemed
            like a human girl at a glance, but Siris was an elf. Hence, she had
            a fair amount of knowledge about other races.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘The ample chest that jiggles as she runs definitely isn’t something
            a human girl of her age could have.’ Siris asked cautiously.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you, by any chance, a dwarf?”</p>
          <p>“Eh? A dwarf?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan looked at Tilla in surprise, examining her from all angles.
            Orcs and elves were often seen infiltrated into human society, but
            dwarves rarely emerged from underground, so even Sillan, a
            high-ranking cleric, had rarely had the chance to meet one.
          </p>
          <p>“Heh, you just look like a human on the outside.”</p>
          <p>
            Still, the ears, not as long as an elf’s but clearly different from
            a human’s with sharp auricles, made it quite evident she might be a
            dwarf. Sillan, intrigued by Tilla, caught Siris’s eye making a
            strange expression.
          </p>
          <p>“Ears?”</p>
          <p>“Huh? What’s up, Siris?”</p>
          <p>“Is the difference only in the ears?”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan tilted his head in confusion, not understanding what she
            meant. Siris laughed heartily and then patted Sillan’s head.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re still an innocent boy, Sillan.”</p>
          <p>
            First, he was an adult, and now, suddenly, she was changing her
            tune.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, what? I don’t know why, but that feels insulting.”</p>
          <p>“You’re kind.”</p>
          <p>“…?”</p>
          <p>
            Anyway, they didn’t have the luxury to dawdle in their fugitive
            situation. Tilla urged them on.
          </p>
          <p>“Hurry, this way.”</p>
          <p>
            The three continued running. Just as they were turning a corridor,
            two soldiers spotted them and grasped their spears tighter.
          </p>

          <p>“Who goes there!”</p>
          <p>
            “They are the accomplices of that thief! How did they escape the
            prison?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris launched herself in a flash. Even without a weapon, her
            hand-to-hand combat skills were considerable. Kicking off the wall,
            she closed the distance in an instant and delivered a triangular
            flying kick, taking down one soldier. As Siris was about to target
            the next one, she was startled.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah?”</p>
          <p>
            The remaining soldier was being confronted by Tilla. It wasn’t with
            flashy martial arts like Siris, but by grabbing the shaft of the
            halberd that was swung down, lifting the adult soldier whole, and
            then slamming him to the ground.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            The soldier, flattened like a frog hit by a carriage, screamed as he
            collapsed. Sillan gaped in astonishment. Where on those slender arms
            did such monstrous strength come from?
          </p>
          <p>“You’re very strong?”</p>
          <p>Seeing Sillan stumble over his words, Tilla grinned.</p>
          <p>“Dwarves are generally quite strong.”</p>
          <p>‘No, that seems to be an understatement.’</p>
          <p>
            Leaving the dumbfounded Sillan behind, Tilla gestured for them to
            hurry.
          </p>
          <p>“Come on, let’s hurry.”</p>
          <p>
            Following Tilla, Sillan and Siris found their belongings in a small
            room. Sillan’s gold was safe, but unfortunately, Siris’s long sword
            was missing. Coveting gold was against chivalry, but taking
            precious-looking enemy weapons as trophies was not considered
            dishonorable, so someone had taken it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the magical bow Nihillen was untouched. It seemed that to
            the untrained eye, Nihillen appeared to be just a simple wooden
            stick and its value went unnoticed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris sighed in relief as she picked up Nihillen. The long sword was
            one thing, but this magical bow had really grown on her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Nihillen was even used in front of the knights, but they failed to
            recognize it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems the information hadn’t been relayed properly. Anyway, it’s
            a relief, Siris.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After gathering their things, Tilla urged them on again. They had
            barely walked down the corridor when Tilla pressed on the wall. With
            a touch, the wall slid open, revealing a small passageway. Sillan
            was startled.
          </p>
          <p>“A secret passage? How did you know this was here?”</p>
          <p>“Well, we built this castle.”</p>
          <p>
            Tilla, looking slightly melancholic, gestured for them to enter.
            After Sillan and Siris had gone into the passage, Tilla glanced out
            the window. Then, she took a small pouch from her pocket.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If I safely rescue the group, I was told to throw this into the
            sky.’
          </p>
          <p>Tilla threw the pouch towards the sky through the window.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>

          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            A loud boom echoed across the blue sky, drawing everyone’s gaze
            upward. A small flame burst into existence above Viscount Kelberen’s
            castle, only to quickly fade away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus von Tenes turned his head to glare at Repenhardt and shouted,
            “What is this? What have you done?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smiled with a relieved expression, “It seems Tilla has
            succeeded.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The flame in the sky was the signal alchemy potion he had given
            Tilla. It originally belonged to Lantas, but Repenhardt had thought
            it might be useful and had sneakily taken it. This signal meant that
            Tilla had successfully rescued Siris and Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus quickly guessed the situation and frowned, “Don’t tell me… you
            were the bait?”
          </p>
          <p>
            With newfound ease, Repenhardt replied in a relaxed voice, “Why else
            would I make such a spectacle?”
          </p>
          <p>
            This had been the plan all along. While Repenhardt drew the
            attention of everyone in Kelberen Castle, Tilla would sneak in and
            rescue the two. Being as familiar with the castle as its maker,
            Tilla knew all about its secret passages and could infiltrate at
            will.
          </p>
          <p>“To think you’d resort to such tactics…”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus, showing a reaction of surprise, puzzled Repenhardt for a
            moment, ‘Isn’t this a basic strategy? Why is he so surprised?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had intentionally been flamboyant, making sure everyone
            in the castle was aware of him. Such a tactic was quite basic; any
            competent commander should have realized he was a decoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Repenhardt chose this strategy to draw out the castle’s forces.
            Even knowing he was bait, Repenhardt’s prowess forced the enemy to
            mobilize fully against him.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed, however, that Eusus had been completely unaware of this.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an incredulous expression while still aiming his sword, Eusus
            said, “Why would you go through all that trouble…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Equally baffled and with a clenched fist, Repenhardt retorted, “What
            do you mean, ‘why’?”
          </p>
          <p>Both looked at each other, furrowing their brows in confusion.</p>
          <p>
            In fact, this was due to the difference in their ways of thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had volunteered for the role of bait out of concern for a
            potential hostage situation. If he tried to rescue the two himself,
            there was a possibility that their lives could be used as leverage.
            Thus, drawing out the main force and having Tilla rescue them was
            deemed safer.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, Eusus was, at his core, a deeply rooted knight.
            His way of thinking could not even entertain the idea of threatening
            someone by holding a knife to a hostage’s throat. According to
            chivalry, hostages were to be well-kept and then released for a
            ransom. Perhaps one could say it was a concept of a lucrative side
            income? (After all, chivalry, contrary to popular belief, has its
            economically savvy aspects. The concept of ransom was adopted by the
            Principality of Chatan to such an extent.)
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, if Eusus had been certain that Sillan and Siris were
            valuable comrades, he might have thought differently. But since they
            were already deemed mere scapegoats, no proper lookout was
            established. Contrary to Repenhardt’s belief, Eusus didn’t even
            consider the possibility that he would come to rescue his
            colleagues.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, whatever. The fact is, Sillan and Siris have safely escaped,
            right?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s eyes sparkled.</p>
          <p>“Good, now I can use my strength to its fullest!”</p>
          <p>
            Though momentarily disconcerted by the escape of the prisoners,
            Eusus quickly regained his composure.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s a problem of no consequence.”</p>
          <p>
            The thief who stole the relic is right before him. The one who
            possesses the relic — or knows its hidden location — is also before
            him. Whether the scapegoats flee or not, if he can subdue this
            person, the situation will be resolved. Conversely, if he fails to
            subdue this person, he will also be unable to stop the thief from
            taking his comrades with him.
          </p>
          <p>“I just need to take this person down!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s eyes gleamed. The distrustful look in his eyes would
            automatically disappear once he subdued this person. Subduing this
            person would solve everything!
          </p>
          <p>“Taaat!”</p>
          <p>
            The Golden Knight unleashed a series of sword strikes with the magic
            sword Eldran, embroidering the air with numerous blades of light,
            surrounding Repenhardt on all sides.
          </p>
          <p>However, the situation did not unfold as Eusus had hoped.</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 67 ]</p>
          <p>
            “The kids must have escaped by now; there’s no need to drag this out
            any longer…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, having strengthened his arms with aura, calmly deflected
            the incoming sword blades. He then started to deliver short punches
            while stepping forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was no need for grand motions. Short and powerful, aiming for
            precise points, he hammered away at the golden armor. With each hit,
            a shockwave penetrated the body, delivering accurate damage. A full
            swing with all his might could even dent pure gold Eldril, but there
            was no need for that. Even with short jabs, Repenhardt was capable
            of penetrating the armor and hitting the opponent’s body.
          </p>
          <p>‘What is this?’</p>
          <p>
            Eusus was taken aback. The opponent’s movements had changed. No
            longer were there large motions or the powerful display of aura
            scattering about. It was an efficient movement, precisely targeting
            only the opponent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pain intensified on Eusus’s face. With each exchange, his body
            sustained more damage. Although he seemed unharmed on the outside,
            his insides felt as if they had been turned over a couple of times,
            causing his whole body to ache.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, agh!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s assault became even more fierce. Punches and kicks from
            all directions relentlessly pummeled Eusus. As Eusus was being
            overwhelmingly pushed back, his eyes suddenly flared with
            determination.
          </p>
          <p>‘I cannot just be pushed back like this…!’</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Eusus raised his sword high. His abdomen openly exposed a
            weakness. Naturally, Repenhardt took the opportunity to strike. A
            shockwave penetrated, and ribs shattered.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            However, this time Eusus did not back down. Despite the severe pain,
            he maintained his stance and immediately counterattacked. He was
            fully prepared to be hit, throwing his body forward to seize an
            opportunity for a counter.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was not about exchanging flesh for bones but giving bones to
            target the opponent’s life, truly a resolve of desperation!
          </p>
          <p>“Cry out! Eldran!”</p>
          <p>
            Activating the magic engraved in his demon sword, Eusus thrust
            forward. His form dashed forward like a flash of lightning.
          </p>
          <p>“Haah!”</p>
          <p>
            Sliding swiftly to close the distance, the golden blade, filled with
            a ferocious aura, aimed at Repenhardt’s shoulder. Prepared,
            Repenhardt quickly twisted his body to dodge the attack and extended
            his left palm. The aura rippled, and a spear of shockwave covered
            Eusus at that moment.
          </p>
          <p>“I am one reflected upon the waters, whose form shall ripple!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s figure blurred and then split into five. It was a mirror
            image, an illusionary duplication magic. It ws not just a simple
            deception, all five Eususes radiated a clear presence. Repenhardt
            inwardly admired the tactic.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘This friend, he truly knows how to deal with aura users. He’s
            skilled in a mage’s tactics, isn’t he?’
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t merely about creating illusions with light; the Mirror
            Image magic, which also replicated the presence of the caster’s
            body, was indiscernible to the senses of aura users. Repenhardt,
            having had his fair share of fun using this magic against aura users
            in his heyday, was well aware of its effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Surely, an aura user wouldn’t be able to identify the real body
            immediately.’
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this didn’t apply to all aura users. No matter how palpable
            the presence felt, an illusion was still not a tangible substance.
            In the case of the Sword Saint Cyrus, he was unique in reading the
            flow of the air cut by the only real body, thereby identifying
            Repenhardt’s true form immediately. But with Repenhardt’s current
            skills, mimicking such an extraordinary feat was outright
            impossible.
          </p>
          <p>‘This time, I can surely defeat him!’</p>
          <p>Eusus, convinced, unleashed his strongest move.</p>

          <p>“Awaken, Eldran! Scatter the light of destruction!”</p>
          <p>
            Five Eususes shouted simultaneously, charging from five directions.
            A palpable presence was felt from every direction. The power
            embedded in the plunging blade, Material Destroy, a high-level 8th
            circle spell, would inflict a fatal wound on Repenhardt, even if he
            managed to pull up his aura, upon impact.
          </p>
          <p>‘But you see…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt didn’t hesitate for a moment and charged at one of them.
            Dodging the blade, he plunged into Eusus’s embrace. A look of horror
            flashed across Eusus’s face. The remaining four blades pierced
            through Repenhardt’s body, but all in vain. Repenhardt had
            unmistakably singled out the real Eusus without any doubt.
          </p>
          <p>Thump!</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s fist struck Eusus’s shoulder. Spewing blood, Eusus spun
            in the air. Then, Repenhardt launched a long kick. The aura-imbued
            spinning kick whipped through the air, striking precisely at Eusus’s
            nape.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            With a clanging sound of crashing, Eusus tumbled to the ground.
            Blood welled up from his mouth.
          </p>
          <p>“Cough, cough! How did you identify the real body?”</p>
          <p>
            ‘It might be difficult with just aura perception, but how could I
            not when the magic patterns are completely different?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching Eusus struggle to his feet using his sword as a crutch,
            Repenhardt scratched his cheek in a somewhat embarrassed manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mirror Image was, after all, a spell used by mages to counter
            warriors. It was virtually useless against another mage or anyone
            who could read magical energies.
          </p>
          <p>‘It does feel a bit like cheating, though….’</p>
          <p>
            Wiping the blood from the corner of his mouth, Eusus von Tenes’s
            eyes widened.
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t know what trick you used, but…”</p>
          <p>His face, always stern, contorted like a demon’s.</p>
          <p>“The sword of Tenes never loses!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus swung Eldran, chanting spells in succession. If not with the
            sword, then with magic!
          </p>
          <p>“Scorching heat, coalesce and strike the foe!”</p>
          <p>
            Dozens of fireballs flew, radiating heat. Repenhardt, growing tired
            of delaying and finding it tedious to fend off each one
            individually, raised his aura. Emitting a golden aura, he spun
            around! A giant vortex of light enveloped Repenhardt’s massive form.
          </p>
          <p>“Spiral Guard!”</p>
          <p>
            All the fireballs were deflected in every direction. Eusus, taken
            aback, prepared his next spell immediately.
          </p>
          <p>“Mist of Cold Winter, shroud the earth!”</p>
          <p>
            A dense mist of cold air enveloped Repenhardt from all sides.
            Indeed, it seemed impossible to dispel the mist with punches or
            kicks. However, Repenhardt’s response was the same.
          </p>
          <p>“Spiral Guard!”</p>
          <p>
            The whirl of aura completely dispersed the cold mist. Eusus’s
            expression turned desperate.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Wind, become arrows! King of Winter, cover the world! Breath of
            Corrosion, flow through the void!”
          </p>
          <p>“Spiral Gu…”</p>
          <p>Eventually, Eusus exploded in frustration.</p>
          <p>
            “No, what is that technique that bounces off everything regardless
            of its type!”
          </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Repenhardt was also marveling at his own body.</p>
          <p>
            ‘This is quite something, almost anything can be dealt with Spiral
            Guard.’
          </p>
          <p>
            A technique that ignores both the attributes and implementation
            methods of magic? Thinking about it now, Teslon too had charged
            through the magic thrown at him, dealing with almost everything with
            his body.
          </p>
          <p>‘How could such a cheat-like technique exist?’</p>
          <p>
            It was astonishing to think about the viciousness of Gym
            Unbreakable, who developed such a technique. Fortunately, the only
            aura users who could use this Spiral Guard were the disciples of Gym
            Unbreakable.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If all aura users could use this technique, the magicians would
            have had to lay down their staffs.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Spiral Guard was not feasible for other aura users to implement. Not
            because of the difficulty of the technique, but because it was so
            brute force.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other aura users could also overlay their aura to increase their
            defense. However, adding rotation to it was impossible. If they did,
            they would be torn apart by the force. Hence, there were quite a few
            who increased the power of their blade aura by rotating it but
            applying it to their body was out of the question for other aura
            users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only Gym Unbreakable, whose bodies were ‘as strong as’ weapons,
            could withstand using it.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Well, as effective as it is, the consumption of aura is no joke
            either.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, after maintaining it for a while, he began to feel a slight
            fatigue. It seemed that everything in the world has its pros and
            cons.
          </p>
          <p>
            As no more magic was coming his way, Repenhardt slowly retracted
            Spiral Guard. It was time to end this fight. He clenched his fists.
          </p>
          <p>‘I need to quickly defeat this guy and join the kids.’</p>
          <p>Hummm!</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s fists glowed incandescently, vibrating with each motion
            and shaking the atmosphere to emit a grand sound. A powerful aura
            burst forth from his entire body, watched with despair by Eusus, who
            suddenly shouted in frustration.
          </p>
          <p>“Who are you?”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Could it be that even upon seeing this golden aura, he’s now asking
            for his identity? Repenhardt momentarily tilted his head in
            confusion. Eusus shouted again.
          </p>
          <p>“I mean, who is behind you?”</p>
          <p>
            Who? Who has orchestrated this, to have such a powerful adversary
            target the Tenes County? Eusus cried out in anguish, as if coughing
            up blood. To Repenhardt, it was nothing but a nonsensical noise.
          </p>
          <p>
            He carelessly looked behind him to see Sir Lot struggling on the
            ground. Turning back, he absentmindedly replied.
          </p>
          <p>“Your lieutenant is there, isn’t he?”</p>

          <p>“Are you mocking me!”</p>
          <p>“No, I’m the one feeling mocked right now…”</p>
          <p>
            He couldn’t understand what was being said, but it seemed there was
            no time to clarify. Eusus, driven by extreme rage, launched himself
            into the air with his last strength.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            He gathered all the remaining magic in Eldrad, aiming for a final
            blow.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Awaken, Eldrad! Arise, Eldran! Grant me the power to shatter all!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus disappeared, and in his place, a golden moon rose. Terrifying
            magical power converged towards Eldran. Repenhardt’s expression
            turned serious.
          </p>
          <p>‘That’s it!’</p>
          <p>
            The unique magic of Eldrad, the ultimate strike that had once turned
            his rigorously trained body to tatters.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a resonant cry, a beam of moonlight shot from the golden moon.
          </p>
          <p>“The light of Eldril!”</p>
          <p>
            A swirling golden aurora filled the view. This technique was not to
            be underestimated. It was safer to respond with his strongest card!
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt slightly bent his knees.</p>
          <p>
            He pulled his right fist back, concentrating his aura at its tip.
          </p>
          <p>
            He channeled all his strength into his legs and kicked off the
            ground.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Instantly, his massive body shot up like a cannonball, tearing
            through space and dragging four aura waves behind it, becoming a
            lance of destruction aimed at the destructive moonlight!
          </p>
          <p>“Calamity Horn!”</p>
          <p>
            A massive golden horn pierced through the light of destruction. The
            light split in all directions, tearing the ground apart. Then,
            golden waves converged into one point. The aura wave pierced through
            the light of destruction, leading Repenhardt towards its end,
            straight to Eusus, where he precisely thrust his fist.
          </p>
          <p>“Thaaaat!”</p>
          <p>
            The fourth aura wave, the last strike of the horn of destruction,
            hit Eusus’s torso accurately. With a loud metallic noise, golden
            shards exploded in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Lot, with a face lost to shock, stared at the scene before him.</p>
          <p>“How… How is this possible…”</p>
          <p>The other Tenes knights felt the same.</p>
          <p>“Lord Eusus is…”</p>
          <p>“Eldrad has…”</p>
          <p>
            Golden fragments were falling. The remnants of Eldrad, the strongest
            existing magical artifact, an armor made from the true gold, Eldril,
            which was believed to be invulnerable to human strength, were now
            shattered and scattered around.
          </p>
          <p>
            And among them lay their leader, believed to be unbreakable, their
            dream and idol, now in tatters, bleeding and rolling on the ground
            in a pitiable state. His eyes were rolled back, exposing the whites,
            a truly miserable sight to behold. He seemed to be completely
            unconscious.
          </p>
          <p>It was a nightmare.</p>
          <p>The sword of Tenes had been broken!</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 68 ]</p>
          <p>“Um…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt slightly shrugged his shoulders as he observed the
            surroundings. Somehow, a rather intense battle had unfolded.
          </p>
          <p>‘I do feel a bit sorry.’</p>
          <p>
            He didn’t really regret stealing the Voice of Elucion. After all, it
            was something unnecessary for them. However, he genuinely felt sorry
            for destroying the magical armor Eldrad. Honestly, Repenhardt hadn’t
            intended to go this far. It was just that the final spell was so
            powerful that he had no choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            His eyes caught a glimpse of a golden sword lying some distance
            away. It was the magical sword Eldran, which had fallen from Eusus’s
            hand. Seeing it eased his guilt a bit.
          </p>
          <p>‘If that’s safe, then Eldrad should be repaired soon.’</p>
          <p>
            All the main formulas that made up the magical armor Eldrad were
            contained in the magical sword Eldran. And for a top-tier magical
            artifact like Eldrad, it had self-restoring capabilities. If Eldran,
            the source of those formulas, was safe, then gathering the fragments
            and leaving them with Eldran would eventually restore Eldrad to its
            original state.
          </p>
          <p>‘It might take about half a year, though…’</p>
          <p>
            What an incredible magical artifact. Repenhardt clicked his tongue,
            newly appreciating the power of Eldrad. It was able to preserve the
            wearer’s life even after facing the final secret technique of Gym
            Unbreakable, Calamity Horn. Well, all the power was focused on the
            armor to save Eusus’s life, but it was still remarkable.
          </p>
          <p>Then, an idea suddenly occurred to him.</p>
          <p>‘Maybe Siris would like to hear about this…’</p>
          <p>
            The situation was different from the magical sword Altion. He was
            confident he could produce as many as he wanted if he just had the
            magic of Altion, but not with Eldrad. Honestly, he had hardly ever
            seen a magical artifact of its caliber, even in his previous life.
            Even when handling 10th circle magic, he hadn’t dared to create an
            artifact of that level. It was among the top-tier relics from the
            Silver Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘After all, Eldrad has the ability to change its form according to
            the wearer’s physical condition… With a slight modification of the
            formulas, it could be adapted to fit Siris’s physique…’
          </p>
          <p>
            If the magical armor Eldrad lacked the versatility of changing shape
            according to the wearer, the County of Tenes wouldn’t have been able
            to inherit it through generations. It’s not like all the Golden
            Knights throughout history had the same body size.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘In about half a year, the armor will be fully restored… Besides,
            even without the magical armor Eldrad, Eldran itself is undoubtedly
            a tremendous magical sword…’
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, an image popped into his head.</p>
          <p>
            A beautiful elf mage knight, clad in golden armor, wielding a
            magical sword, displaying dazzling swordsmanship and powerful magic
            in succession!
          </p>
          <p>It seemed like a perfect match…</p>
          <p>‘Uh, um, I want it, this?’</p>
          <p>
            Once greed took hold, Eldran became increasingly desirable.
            Repenhardt looked at Eldran, who had fallen, with a peculiar gaze,
            causing Sir Lot’s complexion to harden.
          </p>
          <p>‘Indeed, he covets Eldran!’</p>

          <p>
            In the event of a fiefdom duel, it was common among knights to take
            the opponent’s weapon as spoils of war. And Eldran was one of the
            current era’s strongest magical artifacts, recognized by everyone,
            unlike the unidentified Voice of Elucion. It would have been strange
            not to covet it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot looked at Repenhardt with a pale face. Being unaware of the
            Silver Sages, he honestly had no interest in the relic stolen by the
            other. He was somewhat perplexed by Eusus, who had made such a big
            deal out of something so trivial.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Eldran was different! It was a power almost akin to a pillar
            supporting the Tenes Count family! Losing it would mean the downfall
            of the Tenes family!
          </p>
          <p>Then, Repenhardt shook his head.</p>
          <p>‘No, this shouldn’t be done.’</p>
          <p>
            Although he was already in a position to be cursed as a thief,
            Repenhardt had his own reasons. But taking it would indeed make him
            a real thief. He had resolved to become shameless, but that didn’t
            mean he should act recklessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, this was a divine artifact of the Tenes viscount family,
            their greatest strength, honor, and symbol. The situation was
            entirely different from that of Voice of Elucion. Taking it would
            mean the Tenes family would use all their power to pursue him.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, to take Eldran, he would have to kill everyone
            present to hide the fact.
          </p>
          <p>‘There’s absolutely no need to go that far.’</p>
          <p>
            Tempted by greed for a moment, Repenhardt soon calmed himself.
            Eldran belonged to them, just as Voice of Elucion was his.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I’ll just have to arrange for Siris to have the Holy Sword Messiah,
            as in my previous life.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Having made up his mind, Repenhardt slowly walked over and picked up
            Eldran. With everyone from the Tenes family on edge, he looked at
            Eldran and then at Eusus, who was still unconscious. After pondering
            for a moment, Repenhardt turned to Sir Lot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Approaching him and handing over the sword, Repenhardt slightly
            bowed his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I apologize, this item is too important to me to commit such a
            barbaric act.”
          </p>
          <p>Sir Lot looked at Repenhardt with a dazed expression.</p>
          <p>‘What? Wasn’t he just motivated by greed?’</p>
          <p>
            The situation was incomprehensible. The Tenes knights were already
            annihilated, and there was no one left to stop him from simply
            taking Eldran.
          </p>
          <p>
            After hesitating for a moment, Sir Lot accepted the magic sword
            Eldran. He carefully held the sword in a reversed grip, as it was
            his lord’s sword, a weapon he should never have been able to wield.
          </p>
          <p>“Then, I shall take my leave…”</p>
          <p>
            Glancing around stealthily, Repenhardt began to back away. He wanted
            to leave this uncomfortable situation as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <p>That’s when it happened.</p>
          <p>“Stop right there!”</p>

          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            The situation had seemingly ended, so who would call out like this
            now? Confused, Repenhardt turned his gaze. A knight, standing some
            distance away, was shouting while holding his sword.
          </p>
          <p>“The sword of Tenes has not yet been defeated!”</p>
          <p>
            The knight looked quite young, probably in his late twenties. With a
            cold demeanor and sharp eyes, the knight approached Repenhardt. His
            stance with the sword was precise, and his gait seemed oddly stable.
            Repenhardt blinked.
          </p>
          <p>‘Is that that fool from before?’</p>
          <p>
            He remembered him from somewhere. It was the young man who had
            single-handedly made a scene during their encirclement yesterday,
            greatly aiding his escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot looked at the young knight with an expression of disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>“Russ?”</p>
          <p>
            Russ stood in front of Repenhardt with a face full of tension, his
            sword’s tip radiating a sharp fighting spirit. Clearly in a
            combat-ready stance, Sir Lot exclaimed in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you doing, Russ!”</p>
          <p>Keeping his gaze fixed on Repenhardt, Russ replied,</p>
          <p>
            “I, too, am a sword of Tenes. The sword of Tenes has not yet been
            defeated!”
          </p>
          <p>
            His voice was filled with fighting spirit. Even in such a situation,
            not losing courage and drawing his sword was indeed a model for all
            knights. However, Sir Lot did not see it that way.
          </p>
          <p>‘That fool! He’s having another outburst!’</p>
          <p>
            I mean, what can a mere knight do when even Sir Eusus has fallen?
            Ignoring the astounded Sir Lot, Russ straightened his sword and
            charged at Repenhardt with a powerful battle cry.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            A powerful downward strike! Even as an aura user, Repenhardt was
            momentarily startled by the attack. But, of course, it was a
            predictable move. He couldn’t possibly fail to dodge it. Twisting
            his body slightly, Repenhardt dodged the attack with a smirk.
          </p>
          <p>‘So, this was his personality all along.’</p>
          <p>
            It was a swordsman with only one downward strike to worry about.
            There was no need to be concerned. That’s what he thought, at least.
          </p>
          <p>“Haaap!”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, as if dancing in the air, the sword followed through the
            motion of the strike, slicing near his side. Moreover, the speed and
            force were extraordinary. Caught off guard, Repenhardt hastily
            moved.
          </p>
          <p>“Gasp!”</p>

          <p>Swish!</p>
          <p>
            His clothes were sliced, and he felt a slight pain. Quickly jumping
            back, Repenhardt was surprised as he looked at his side. Between the
            torn fabric, a faint trail of blood was visible. It was just a
            slight scratch on the skin, but it was clear. The young knight had
            definitely inflicted a wound on his body.
          </p>
          <p>“What is this?”</p>
          <p>
            Surprised, Repenhardt looked at Russ again. And he was astonished
            once more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ, in a ready stance with his sword aimed, had his long sword
            glowing with a bluish-white light.
          </p>
          <p>“…Blade Aura?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“What’s this?”</p>
          <p>“What happened?”</p>
          <p>
            The knights of Tenes were all buzzing with astonishment. They
            couldn’t believe it. Russ, who had been nothing but a laughingstock,
            now had the ultimate light that all swordsmen dream of, shining from
            his sword.
          </p>
          <p>Sir Lot opened his mouth wide in astonishment.</p>
          <p>“What, what is it, Russ? What happened?”</p>
          <p>Still glaring at Repenhardt, Russ replied with a cold voice.</p>
          <p>“I have merely reclaimed the sword of Tenes.”</p>
          <p>
            At the same time, an indescribable sense of pressure emanated from
            Russ. There was no longer any room for doubt. That overwhelming
            presence, which seemed to suppress everything, was the same
            sensation they had all too familiarly experienced through
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>It was undeniable. Russ had definitely awakened to his aura!</p>
          <p>Sir Lot moaned with a mixture of awe and bewilderment.</p>
          <p>“My goodness…”</p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, Repenhardt was looking at Russ with a different
            kind of perplexity. It wasn’t simply because a new aura wielder had
            suddenly appeared as an enemy. While others might be excitedly
            astonished, as an aura user himself, Repenhardt could clearly sense
            Russ’s skill level.
          </p>
          <p>
            This young knight had just recently awakened to his aura. The way he
            used his aura to strengthen his body was noticeably clumsy, and his
            blade aura, fluctuating in intensity, clearly wasn’t refined enough
            to be maintained properly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all aura users were of similar skill. Compared to Repenhardt,
            who had awakened his aura years ago, Russ was lacking in every
            aspect. Though Repenhardt had been caught off guard and had a close
            call earlier, it was clear that he was not going to lose.
          </p>
          <p>
            What puzzled him was that the blade aura Russ was emitting felt
            eerily familiar.
          </p>
          <p>‘Wait? That blade aura, why does its color look so familiar?’</p>
          <p>
            The color of an aura varied slightly according to the martial sects
            of the continent. While blue and red hues were common, there were
            also green, purple, and others. In fact, Gym Unbreakable also
            possessed a unique golden aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            And though they generally referred to it as blue, if one looked
            closely, there were quite a few variations: dark blue, light blue,
            cerulean, etc. Just as there are no two identical humans, the light
            of an aura also slightly varied, reflecting individuality.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now, Russ was displaying a blade aura with a deep blue hue that
            felt profound. It was clear and deep, reminiscent of the sky itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had seen this aura before. No, more than seen – he had
            crossed blades with it multiple times.

          <p>[ Chapter 69 ]</p>
          <p>
            Once he recognized the identity of his opponent, his face also
            became unmistakably clear. Those sharp eyes, the cold demeanor, and
            the lips stubbornly pressed together.
          </p>
          <p>There was no mistake.</p>
          <p>
            It was Cyrus, the greatest swordsman of the continent, the Sword
            Saint who had tormented him so.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt inadvertently let slip a word that made Russ show a
            moment of surprise.
          </p>
          <p>“How do you know my real name?”</p>
          <p>
            His full name was Cyrus von Tenes. It was the name he received when
            he was knighted. However, nobody recognized him as a knight, so
            everyone called him Russ, the name his humble mother used, not the
            name given by the Count of Tenes.
          </p>
          <p>Seeing Russ flustered, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Really, why didn’t I recognize him at first? Even though I knew he
            was from the Tenes Count family.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the Tenes family was famous as the Golden Knights, but 30 years
            later, it was different. Having produced an outstanding swordsman,
            the Sword Saint, the Tenes family had risen from a Count family to a
            Marquis, shedding the disgrace of being called a sword family that
            relied on magical tools. The reason Repenhardt briefly failed to
            recognize them when he first heard the story of the Golden Knights
            was precisely because, in his time, the Golden Knight was already a
            forgotten figure.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt was staring at Russ, suddenly Russ blushed and
            murmured.
          </p>
          <p>
            “…Moreover, the Sword Saint. Such an immense title is too much…”
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, he’s embarrassed, that guy.’</p>
          <p>
            After all, having just awakened his aura, it must be embarrassing to
            be called by such an immense title as the Sword Saint by a senior
            aura user.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a bit awkward to say, ‘Not you now, but you in the future.’
            Shaking his head, Repenhardt simply waved his hand.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, you looked similar to someone I know. Don’t mind it.”</p>
          <p>At that, Russ’s expression noticeably fell.</p>
          <p>‘Ah, he’s disappointed, that guy.’</p>
          <p>
            Why are his inner feelings so transparent? The Sword Saint, Cyrus,
            in his previous life, always had a stiff face and an indifferent
            gaze, perfectly fitting the image of a saint.
          </p>
          <p>‘It seems people really do change as they age.’</p>
          <p>
            Meeting his past enemy once again brought complex feelings to
            Repenhardt. With a complicated expression, Repenhardt readied
            himself once more. Russ, too, regained his composure and aimed his
            sword. The moment their gazes met in the air.
          </p>
          <p>“Charge!”</p>
          <p>Russ was the first to leap forward.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The blue blade aura slashed down with the intent to split
            Repenhardt’s head in two. He defended with his forearm, causing the
            auras to collide and generate a shockwave.
          </p>
          <p>“Whoosh!”</p>

          <p>
            The shockwave from the collision spread in all directions, tearing
            up the ground. Cutting through the vibrating air, Repenhardt thrust
            his fist forward. Russ, unable to dodge in time, took a direct hit
            to the abdomen. The shockwave pierced through his armor and
            penetrated his torso. In that moment, a shout burst from Russ’s
            mouth.
          </p>
          <p>“Haap!”</p>
          <p>
            The blue aura flared briefly before seeping into his body, wrapping
            around his insides to neutralize the shockwave. Then, he executed a
            swift left and right slicing attack!
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Surprised, Repenhardt stepped back to avoid the onslaught. To think
            he managed to so cleanly block an attack that could nullify
            defenses! Even Eusus had only endured the impact before healing his
            body with Eldrad’s healing magic. It had taken Repenhardt a whole
            month to master the technique of protecting his insides with aura.
          </p>
          <p>‘This newly awakened one has some tricks up his sleeve.’</p>
          <p>
            Russ swung his sword relentlessly at Repenhardt. Blade auras from
            all directions surged towards Repenhardt, producing a grand noise,
            as if to beat him down. A flicker of panic passed through
            Repenhardt’s eyes.
          </p>
          <p>‘What? This is…’</p>
          <p>
            He couldn’t read the attacks. They were coming from completely
            unexpected directions, making them impossible to predict.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it’s weapon skills or unarmed combat, all martial arts are
            based on some established theory. It was a system honed over many
            years by countless warriors, which Repenhardt had also practiced
            under Gerard.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Russ’s swordsmanship was different. It wasn’t bound by any form.
            He didn’t assume any fixed stance. He simply rampaged like a wild
            beast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Logically, such movements should lack proper power and be full of
            openings.
          </p>
          <p>‘But it’s actually powerful and I can’t see any openings.’</p>
          <p>
            It was fascinating. Despite seeming erratic, the flow of power was
            correct and efficient. Even though the movements appeared random,
            each sword strike arrived at the perfect timing and angle. Moreover,
            all those attacks were imbued with blue aura, lending them proper
            force.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘So, he’s just swinging around as he pleases, but it’s not against
            the principles?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Gerard had also said that among martial artists, there are those who
            don’t follow instructions and just swing as they like. Most are
            fools who quickly end up dead, but occasionally, a real genius
            emerges.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Indeed, a sword genius that comes once every hundred years, as they
            say!’
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt’s expression turned cold.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Indeed… With such innate talent, it’s no wonder he was called a
            Sword Saint…’
          </p>
          <p>
            And it made sense that he could have defeated Tassid, the great orc
            warrior, who was both a precious subordinate and a friend!
          </p>
          <p>Gradually, killing intent began to rise within him.</p>
          <p>
            He knew that the young man before him was not Tassid’s enemy. That
            was a matter of the future, yet to occur. However, the unchanging
            fact in his memory was that the Sword Saint Cyrus was Tassid’s
            enemy.
          </p>
          <p>‘Tassid!’</p>
          <p>
            A corner of his heart began to boil. Repenhardt, with a hardened
            complexion, launched a counterattack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Golden aura was overtaken by a blue hue. Every incoming blade aura
            shattered against the advancing fists, scattering into the void.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as Repenhardt went on the offensive, Russ began to be
            overwhelmingly pushed back. Russ, having been pushed back more than
            ten meters in an instant, groaned in despair.
          </p>

          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            All attacks missed. The sword light he swung more than dozens of
            times cut through the air in vain.
          </p>
          <p>
            And with each attempt, a counterattack came. Countless fists struck
            his entire body. Even his aura, summoned for defense, was shattered
            by the intense shock waves imbued in the fists, inflicting severe
            damage on his body.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>Swear words naturally spilled out.</p>
          <p>
            Russ’s movements were undoubtedly impressive. Even Repenhardt
            couldn’t predict them.
          </p>
          <p>But avoiding attacks isn’t always about prediction.</p>
          <p>Can’t predict them? Then just watch and dodge.</p>
          <p>
            Once Repenhardt began his counterattack, Russ was continually pushed
            back without being able to properly swing his sword. Despite Russ’s
            remarkable talent, the fundamental difference in their abilities was
            too great.
          </p>
          <p>
            In strength, speed, visual tracking, reflexes, and even resilience,
            Repenhardt was significantly superior. His aura control occasionally
            showed brilliant flashes of sense but did not maintain consistency
            overall.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was no match. No matter how much power Russ derived from his
            aura, he was no match.
          </p>
          <p>Filled with humiliation, Russ howled like a wild beast.</p>
          <p>“I am the sword of Tenes!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ raised his sword above his head. The blade aura blazed in a
            bright blue. His most confident and long-practiced downward slash
            exploded towards Repenhardt with a force that seemed to split the
            heavens and earth.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The aura tore through the air, thundering. But Repenhardt was no
            longer there. He had already moved to Russ’s left, launching an
            uppercut.
          </p>
          <p>“Hup!”</p>
          <p>
            With a short shout, Repenhardt delivered a majestic uppercut to
            Russ’s side. Concentrating the explosive power of the aura and the
            elasticity of his entire body into one point, he struck with
            devastating force!
          </p>
          <p>“Cough!”</p>
          <p>Spitting blood, Russ’s body was launched into the air.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            In the cold embrace of winter winds within Viscount Kelberen’s
            castle grounds, a young knight groaned in agony upon the frostbitten
            earth.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, ahh… Ahh…”</p>
          <p>
            Surrounded by a pool of vomited blood at his feet, unable to steady
            himself yet refusing to fall, the young knight leaned on his
            longsword as if it were a staff, barely holding himself upright as
            he continuously muttered,
          </p>
          <p>
            “I, I am the sword of Tenes… The sword of Tenes does not break…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the battle being decisively over, with his body on the brink
            of collapse, held up solely by his willpower, refusing to kneel,
            Russ, the young knight, was observed with cold eyes by Repenhardt.
          </p>

          <p>‘Cyrus…’</p>
          <p>
            The punch had been intended to kill, a strike delivered with a
            lethal intent unlike any he had thrown at Eusus or others.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Russ did not die. Nor did he fall. Though he had exhausted all
            his strength, standing there as if he were but a corpse, he still
            stood before him.
          </p>
          <p>This sight left Repenhardt conflicted.</p>
          <p>‘…Should I finish him off?’</p>
          <p>
            He wished to kill him right there, yet part of him resisted that
            desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t solely because Russ was yet to commit any crime. Was it
            not better to remove a potential threat now, who might harm someone
            important to him in the future?
          </p>
          <p>‘But…’</p>
          <p>
            If he were the Tassid he knew, the orc possessing the soul of a
            great warrior, he would never desire such an outcome. He might even
            be angry with Repenhardt for not allowing him to seek revenge
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>‘Tassid would seriously be angry, no doubt.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt suddenly smirked. Upon reflection, it was about an event
            that hadn’t even occurred – why worry about seeking revenge?
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides, even if it wasn’t about revenge, there were still lingering
            concerns. Tassid had clashed with the Sword Saint Cyrus several
            times in a previous life. Each encounter pushed both to reach
            greater heights. Perhaps Tassid’s attainment of the Great Orc
            Warrior’s strength was, in some way, thanks to Cyrus. Rivals, after
            all, are meant to push each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, harming this individual here might potentially disrupt
            Tassid’s future.
          </p>
          <p>Ultimately, Repenhardt retracted his intent to kill.</p>
          <p>‘Yes, this one is for Tassid to deal with.’</p>
          <p>
            The Great Orc Warrior he knew was never weak. He only lost due to
            unfavorable circumstances; in a fair fight, he would never be
            defeated by the Sword Saint Cyrus.
          </p>
          <p>‘And my duty is to provide Tassid with a fair battlefield.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt slowly approached Russ. Russ’s complexion hardened under
            the cold glare directed at him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was on the verge of collapse. A mere swipe from his opponent
            could end his life. Sensing his imminent death, Russ closed his
            eyes, but then a chilling voice reached his ears.
          </p>
          <p>“I shall spare you.”</p>
          <p>
            Startled, Russ opened his eyes. The gaze that met his was still
            cold, almost eerie, as the figure continued speaking.
          </p>
          <p>“Survive. And become stronger. For my friend Tassid.”</p>
          <p>“What, what?”</p>
          <p>
            Leaving a bewildered Russ behind, Repenhardt stomped the ground,
            launching his massive form into the air, flying towards the outer
            walls. Leaving a golden trail behind, Repenhardt leaped over the
            inner walls and through the broken outer walls, disappearing from
            sight beyond the castle of Kelberen, leaving Russ and the knights of
            Tenes dumbfounded.
          </p>
          <p>Silence prevailed. No one spoke.</p>
          <p>
            The enemy had vanished. What remained was the shattered castle, the
            decimated knights of Tenes, and their leader, still struggling to
            regain his senses.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a cry, Russ swung his sword down. The blade aura tore through
            the earth, emitting a majestic roar.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Among the flying debris and cloud of dust, Russ let out a long,
            animalistic howl, like a wounded beast crying out in agony.
          </p>
          <p>“Uaaaaah!”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 70 ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, having left Viscount Kelberen’s castle, made a beeline
            across the forest towards the previously agreed meeting spot. It was
            by the riverside, about 3 kilometers upstream along the Yaham River
            that flowed around Kelberen Castle, where he was supposed to meet up
            with Tilla.
          </p>
          <p>
            After running for a while, he soon saw the shadows of three people
            through a small forest by the riverbank. It was Siris, Sillan, and
            Tilla.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, Repenhardt! You’ve returned safely!”</p>
          <p>
            Upon seeing him, Tilla waved her hand in joy. Repenhardt immediately
            leaped towards them. Once he approached, he noticed that both Siris
            and Sillan had somewhat sullen expressions.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a natural reaction, considering the situation. They had been
            through troubles because he had insisted on attempting to steal,
            only to fail miserably.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt, feeling awkward, scratched his head.</p>
          <p>“I’m glad everyone is safe…”</p>
          <p>Suddenly, Sillan laughed brightly, shrugging his shoulders.</p>
          <p>
            “Really, thanks to Mr. Repen, we had quite the unusual experience.”
          </p>
          <p>
            His voice was cheerful, but the content was anything but. Sillan
            continued to giggle as he spoke.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve heard that setting out as a pilgrim would lead to all sorts of
            experiences, but I never imagined that, having become a clergyman,
            I’d be treated as a thief and get to see the inside of a jail. Ah!
            So, this is why they say the world is full of surprises!”
          </p>
          <p>
            From Repenhardt’s perspective, there was nothing he could say in
            response.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m, I’m sorry.”</p>
          <p>
            However, it seemed they weren’t too angry. Both of them relaxed
            their expressions immediately. It seemed more like they just wanted
            to complain rather than being truly upset.
          </p>
          <p>“Anyway, it’s a relief that everyone is safe.”</p>
          <p>Sillan clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>
            “It wasn’t much, but it was quite dangerous, actually. I mean, it’s
            one thing for me, but Siris is an elf, and a young lady at that.
            Didn’t you think she could have been in real danger if something
            went wrong?”
          </p>
          <p>
            At this, Repenhardt’s complexion changed dramatically. He hadn’t
            thought of that. Even humans, especially young women, could face
            unknown fates if imprisoned, let alone a beautiful elf who could
            have ended up as a slave. The horrific scenarios were unspeakable.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt grabbed Siris’s shoulder, shaking it frantically.</p>
          <p>
            “Are, are you okay, Siris? They didn’t do anything to you, did
            they?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris grimaced slightly, as if in pain from her shoulder. Startled,
            Repenhardt withdrew his hand as Sillan waved him off.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There was nothing serious. Besides, the knights of Eusus are
            renowned figures; they were all quite gentlemanly. No foul play
            happened.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The reputation of a knightly order does not necessarily mean its
            members are gentlemen. Their fame stems from their valor, not their
            virtue. If anything, the knights of Eusus did not harass Siris more
            likely influenced by Eusus’s own disdain for debauchery.
          </p>
          <p>‘It was indeed a stroke of luck.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt sighed in relief, feeling a chill down his spine at the
            thought of what might have happened to Siris.
          </p>
          <p>‘I must be more cautious in the future.’</p>
          <p>
            There was also the precedent in the Principality of Chatan.
            Repenhardt resolved to move more carefully from now on. Siris then
            looked straight at him and asked.
          </p>

          <p>“So, did you get what you wanted, Lord Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>“Uh? Yes, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt took out the Voice of Elucion from his pocket. Everyone
            looked on with curiosity. It appeared as nothing more than a
            rectangular black box, leading Sillan to tilt his head and ask.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What’s this for, exactly? It doesn’t seem like something you’d use
            for martial arts training.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Of course, it’s not. It’s a relic from the Silver Age, completely
            unrelated to martial arts.’
          </p>
          <p>
            But admitting it was a lie after causing such a fuss was
            unthinkable. Repenhardt vaguely brushed it off.
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t know. My master just told me to fetch it.”</p>
          <p>
            It was a smooth answer, and everyone seemed to accept it. Repenhardt
            then urged the group to move on, putting the Voice of Elucion back
            into his pocket.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s get out of this domain.”</p>
          <p>
            After the commotion they caused, staying in Viscount Kelberen’s
            territory was out of the question. Everyone began to follow
            Repenhardt’s lead.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The red sunset draped softly over the castle walls. As evening
            approached, Kelberen Castle buzzed with activity. Servants were busy
            tending to the wounded and clearing the debris of destruction
            scattered about.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the crowd, knights of the Tenes order, bandaged here and
            there, also lent their hands. Despite a rather miserable defeat,
            surprisingly, no one had lost their life to the ‘aura ability
            thief’. Those severely injured were few, thanks in part to the
            healers of Aerius, who had used their healing magic. Most had
            awakened within half a day, able to move their bodies reasonably
            well. Of course, the magicians were still groaning, clutching their
            uniformly broken legs.
          </p>
          <p>
            One might expect the knights to be filled with gloom over their
            woeful defeat, but surprisingly, their faces did not reflect such
            darkness. Though they were certainly concerned about the tarnished
            honor of the Tenes order, their eyes shone with something beyond
            that—hope.
          </p>
          <p>“…Is that really true, Evron?”</p>
          <p>“I saw it with my own eyes, Knight Baras.”</p>
          <p>
            The humiliation from the defeat of the Golden Knight was forgotten
            in the face of new glory. Everyone was abuzz about the new sword of
            Tenes, the true realm of the sword, Cyrus who had awakened his aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though they were loyal followers of Eusus, they had ears too.
            They were aware of how other houses judged their commander, who
            flaunted his power with the help of magical artifacts.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Eusus himself argued that the skill to use magical artifacts
            was a merit of one’s own, they were still regarded as half-knights
            at best, dishonorably leveraging the power of tools rather than
            their own skill.
          </p>
          <p>But now, things had changed!</p>
          <p>
            An aura ability wielder was respected anywhere on the continent.
            There was not a warrior who wouldn’t revere the brilliant light of
            that ultimate realm contained within the sword.
          </p>
          <p>“Finally… the Tenes order has a true aura ability wielder…”</p>
          <p>Baras murmured with emotion.</p>
          <p>
            From the balcony window of a bedroom on the third floor, overlooking
            the inner courtyard, Eusus von Tenes gazed outside.
          </p>
          <p>He didn’t need to see to know.</p>
          <p>He didn’t need to hear to understand.</p>
          <p>The focus of all the knights was no longer on him.</p>
          <p>“…Everyone is talking about Russ.”</p>
          <p>
            After waking up, he had been briefed on the situation by Knight Lot.
            He had learned what had happened. The realization that he had lost
            the Voice of Elucion, and the concern that he had failed the mission
            given by the Silver Sage, no longer existed.
          </p>

          <p>“Aura… The power of aura has been obtained…”</p>
          <p>
            He, too, had once dreamt of such power. He had harbored delusions
            that perhaps, with enough hard work, even a mere sliver of that
            great light would be granted to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he had come to accept reality and given up without regret. He
            acknowledged that there was no path towards Aura within his family
            and chose the path of a magic swordsman, wielding the magic sword
            Eldran. And he did not regret that choice. At least, not until now…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘How could such power be in the hands of that wretched whore’s
            offspring…’
          </p>
          <p>It was unbelievable. At first, he doubted his own ears.</p>
          <p>
            Had they not said the path to Aura was lost? That there was no other
            way, and so he must wield Eldran!
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet now, all his loyal subordinates, who had followed him without a
            hint of doubt, were calling Russ’s name. Those who had despised and
            ignored Russ were now acting as if a savior had appeared for the
            family, just because a light had appeared in his sword!
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            His grip tightened. A faint trace of blood seeped from the
            fingertips clutching the window frame. His fingernail had cracked.
          </p>
          <p>His mind was in turmoil. He had no idea what to do next.</p>
          <p>
            The path he had believed to be so bright, all his future, felt
            enveloped in darkness.
          </p>
          <p>The damned father who openly adored Russ.</p>
          <p>
            The elders of the family who praised Eusus publicly but still
            lamented the lack of an Aura wielder in private.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, the Tenes Count family had an Aura user. Just one was enough to
            elevate the family’s status by several levels, a supreme martial
            artist had emerged.
          </p>
          <p>‘What about me?’</p>
          <p>
            What becomes of him, who has thrown himself into training for the
            family’s sake? Afraid of becoming a burden, always cautious in his
            conduct, elevating the name of the Golden Knight, believing that
            even without Aura, he could still be a noble knight, wielding his
            sword to this day!
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s expression twisted severely. Suddenly, he turned his head.
            In a corner of the bedroom lay the golden armor, shattered and
            cracked. The magic armor Eldrad, barely gathering its fragments for
            self-repair, seemed to mirror his current state.
          </p>
          <p>
            In its center was the magic sword, Eldran, towards which Eusus
            walked as if in a trance.
          </p>
          <p>“This is the sword of Tenes…”</p>
          <p>His trembling hand reached out and grasped Eldran.</p>
          <p>Swoosh.</p>
          <p>Eldran was drawn. Eusus muttered once more.</p>
          <p>“I am the sword of Tenes…”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Russ stood atop a cliff overlooking the Yaham River, gazing at the
            setting sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite everyone else being busy with cleanup, no tasks were
            assigned to Russ. Of course, he was in no condition to move around
            much. Even after receiving healing, his broken ribs hadn’t fully
            mended, and he couldn’t walk without a cane due to his leg injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Russ’s exclusion from work wasn’t solely due to his
            injuries. The knights’ attitudes towards him had completely changed
            after he manifested his aura.
          </p>

          <p>Contempt turned into awe.</p>
          <p>Neglect turned into praise.</p>
          <p>
            All he did was awaken his aura, yet the world around him had
            completely changed.
          </p>
          <p>“Ha, hahaha…”</p>
          <p>
            He knew the truth. Despite Russ becoming an aura user, Eusus still
            had greater martial prowess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eldrad’s power could overwhelm most aura users, and Eusus had
            already reached the pinnacle of mastery over Eldrad. Russ would have
            to undergo a difficult journey to catch up to Eusus’s martial
            prowess, despite having awakened his aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, people were already treating Russ as if he had become the new
            sword of Tenes. It was laughable but also pleasing.
          </p>
          <p>And deep down, Russ accepted this fact.</p>
          <p>“I’m still lacking…”</p>
          <p>He smiled, clenching his fist.</p>
          <p>“But soon. I can catch up soon.”</p>
          <p>
            It was just the beginning. Soon, he would truly become the sword of
            Tenes.
          </p>
          <p>Feeling exhilarated, Russ burst into laughter.</p>
          <p>“Haahaha!”</p>
          <p>That’s when it happened.</p>
          <p>
            “What’s there to be so happy about, after being defeated together?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Startled, Russ turned around to find Eusus standing atop the cliff.
            Normally, he would have found it odd that Eusus hadn’t been detected
            by his aura user senses.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Russ was too surprised to even consider this, having not
            expected Eusus to initiate a conversation. Especially since Eusus
            always treated him as if he didn’t exist. Hearing Eusus’s words made
            him slightly embarrassed; he had been so preoccupied with being an
            aura user that he hadn’t even reflected on his defeat.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Russ quickly dismissed that thought. He wasn’t the type to
            reflect on defeat. If he were, he wouldn’t have disregarded orders
            and charged in recklessly, only to be blown away.
          </p>
          <p>Eusus approached and spoke.</p>
          <p>“I heard you awakened your aura.”</p>
          <p>
            His voice was gentle, a completely unexpected tone, causing Russ to
            awkwardly nod.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, yes. Yes…”</p>
          <p>“Will you show me?”</p>
          <p>After swallowing, Russ drew his sword from his waist.</p>
          <p>Whoom whoom whoom!</p>
          <p>
            A low hum sounded as a brilliant blue blade aura softly climbed the
            long sword’s blade. Gazing at the radiant light, Eusus murmured in a
            dazed voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Beautiful…”</p>
          <p>Russ’s expression brightened.</p>
          <p>
            Finally, he had received recognition. His brother, his family,
            acknowledged his sword.
          </p>
          <p>‘I’ve been recognized as the sword of Tenes!’</p>
          <p>Suddenly, he felt a dull pain in his abdomen.</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Blood seeped out. Red blood flowed down the golden blade, and that
            blade was deeply piercing through his abdomen…
