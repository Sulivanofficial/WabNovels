          <p>[ Chapter 71 ]</p>
          <p>“Cough!”</p>
          <p>Spitting blood, Russ’s eyes shot open.</p>
          <p>
            He hadn’t been on his guard at all. It had never occurred to him
            that Eusus, who was so deeply engrossed in chivalry, would harm him
            out of jealousy.
          </p>
          <p>“Why, why?”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s lips stretched into a long, sinister smile as he looked at
            his horrified half-brother. It was a damp, hideously ugly smile.
          </p>
          <p>“My sword shall resonate with the spirit within!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus declared as he plunged his sword in. A terrifying energy
            spread from Eldran, turning Russ’s insides upside down. Being an
            aura user, there was a chance he wouldn’t die from a blow to the
            abdomen, so Eusus made sure to confirm the kill.
          </p>
          <p>It was certain! Eusus intended to kill him!</p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            Groaning, Russ swung his sword horizontally. The blade aura extended
            long, aiming for Eusus. However, Eusus had already retracted Eldran
            and stepped back. The sword light cut through the air in vain and
            exploded above the cliff.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The explosion made the cliff tremble. Clutching his stomach, Russ’s
            eyes bulged as bloodshot tears streamed down his face.
          </p>
          <p>“Why, why me… Brother… why…”</p>
          <p>Eusus snapped coldly.</p>
          <p>“Tenes is sufficient with me alone as a sword.”</p>
          <p>Eusus aimed Eldran horizontally at Russ’s throat.</p>
          <p>
            “I cannot acknowledge someone born from a filthy stray as a sword of
            Tenes!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, a rustling noise came from behind. The explosion had attracted
            the knights of Tenes.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
          <p>“What happened now!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s attention momentarily drifted to the back. Seizing this
            moment, Russ summoned his last strength.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            With all his might, Russ threw himself into the river. Eusus turned
            around too late.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn!”</p>
          <p>
            It was too late. Russ’s body was already falling towards the dark
            river. With a splash, the dark waters swallowed Russ.
          </p>
          <p>“Tch…”</p>

          <p>
            Eusus clicked his tongue. He didn’t think that Russ could survive
            such injuries, but one never knows.
          </p>
          <p>
            Didn’t it happen in many tales of heroes? The one who falls from a
            cliff into a river later comes back robustly alive to take revenge
            on the one who stabbed them. It’s a scene so common that it rarely
            appears as a material anymore.
          </p>
          <p>‘You must always be prepared, just in case.’</p>
          <p>
            Eusus von Tenes quickly drew his sword and slashed across his own
            body, spilling his blood in various places. Soon after, Lot and a
            few other knights arrived at the top of the cliff.
          </p>
          <p>Upon seeing Eusus, Lot exclaimed, “What happened, Lord Eusus!”</p>
          <p>“It’s Russ!”</p>
          <p>
            Pretending to be in pain, Eusus cried out, “Russ attacked me, aiming
            for the position of the head of the family!”
          </p>
          <p>“No, that can’t be…”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone was shocked, but then they quickly began to denounce Russ.
            Despite their admiration for Russ, who had recently awakened his
            aura, they were ultimately loyal knights of Eusus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, Eusus’s claim was plausible. Russ had always been vocal
            about being the sword of the Tenes family. Now that he was an aura
            user, he must have thought he could take over as head of the family
            if only Eusus were gone!
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh! There’s no changing the dirty lineage!”</p>
          <p>“Why would such talent be bestowed upon such a person…”</p>
          <p>
            Everything went according to plan. No one doubted Eusus’s words. It
            seemed this was why one’s conduct was important.
          </p>
          <p>“What about Russ?”</p>
          <p>
            At Lot’s question, Eusus, pretending to struggle, replied,
            “Fortunately, I was able to counterattack in time. He fell into the
            river with a wound in his abdomen, so it’s unlikely he’ll survive.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if Russ survived, there would be no big problem. By attempting
            to kill Eusus, he had become an enemy of the family. Of course, he
            might seek revenge like in the typical hero stories, but Eusus was
            confident he could handle that much.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No matter how much of an aura user you are, you can’t withstand the
            power of Eldrad.’
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important thing was not to lose the position of successor.
            He didn’t feel that his actions were despicable. Someone who
            couldn’t win the hearts of the people would be of no help to the
            family as a successor. He had made the right choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Supported by Lot, Eusus walked down the cliff. A cold smile appeared
            on the lips of Eusus, who had his head bowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘You should have tried to win the hearts of the people, brother.’
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s party continued to walk along the banks of the Yaham
            River, intending to follow the river downstream and leave the
            territory of Viscount Kelberen. Even as dusk fell, they did not stop
            their march. Normally, they would have started to prepare for an
            overnight stay, but at this time, it was crucial to leave the
            viscount’s land as soon as possible. Hence, they planned to travel
            through the night if necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt carefully scanned the surroundings, leading the way. He
            was worried that Viscount Kelberen might have sent a pursuit team
            after them. Although Repenhardt himself was confident in dealing
            with any pursuit team, he couldn’t help but be cautious, considering
            that Siris, Sillan, and Tilla could get injured in the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noticing Repenhardt’s cautiousness, Siris quietly asked him a
            question, indicating she was becoming more open and frequently
            initiating conversations — a welcome development. Repenhardt
            responded with a smile, asking, “Yes? What is it?”
          </p>
          <p>“How did you come to know Miss Tilla?”</p>
          <p>
            This was a question Repenhardt had been pondering over how to
            explain.
          </p>
          <p>
            He decided to not lie to Siris any longer and told her the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I was thrown into the river by the Golden Knight and floated
            downstream, where the dwarves rescued me.”
          </p>

          <p>“Dwarves saved a human?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, unsurprisingly, questioned this. Repenhardt nodded,
            explaining there had been a prophecy from Al Fort stating that he
            was destined to save the dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris looked at him skeptically, as if thinking he was joking.
            However, Tilla confirmed his story, nodding and stating, “Yes,
            Repenhardt is the savior prophesied to rescue our clan. That’s why I
            am following him now.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan, who had been listening, looked incredulously at Tilla as she
            began to explain further.
          </p>
          <p>
            About six years ago, a prophecy was given to the dwarves,
            foretelling that a savior would come floating down the river. Thus,
            when Repenhardt was found, they saved him and decided to follow his
            lead.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan, astounded, turned to Repenhardt, questioning the religious
            beliefs of dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>“Dwarves believe in gods?”</p>
          <p>“There are even priests among them. Didn’t you know?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan shook his head, admitting his ignorance on the matter of
            dwarven priests.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tilla retorted sharply, “Of course, humans wouldn’t think that a
            ‘slave race’ could engage in such advanced spiritual activities as
            faith.”
          </p>
          <p>“No, that’s not what I meant…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan had changed his views significantly during his journey with
            Repenhardt, especially after observing Siris. He understood that
            individual beings from other races could have emotions and intellect
            similar to humans, but the idea that entire races held religious
            beliefs had not occurred to him. According to the teachings he had
            received, all non-human races were considered slaves created by the
            gods for humans.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, the dwarves have their god, Al Fort.”</p>
          <p>“Al Fort? Isn’t that a malevolent god?”</p>
          <p>“What exactly did Al Fort do?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan realized he had heard Al Fort was malevolent but never
            learned why.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the midst of this confusion, Siris, looking towards the river,
            frowned.
          </p>
          <p>“Lord Repenhardt, over there…”</p>
          <p>“Yes?”</p>
          <p>“I might be seeing things, but… that looks like a person…”</p>
          <p>
            In the darkness, something was drifting closer. Floating towards
            them, it eventually stopped at the riverbank.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was indeed a person — a rather robust warrior, it seemed.
            Repenhardt, sensing the man was still alive, rushed over.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he turned the man over to see his face, Repenhardt’s eyes widened
            in recognition.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, this guy?”</p>
          <p>‘How did he end up here? And he’s been stabbed?’</p>
          <p>“Do you know him?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt scratched his head at Siris’s question.</p>

          <p>
            “It’s someone who, if you know, you know, and if you don’t, you
            don’t…”
          </p>
          <p>
            The man’s identity was Cyrus, the opponent they had fiercely fought
            just half a day ago. Sillan quickly prepared a healing spell and
            cast it on Russ. Tilla muttered to herself upon seeing this.
          </p>
          <p>“…Was there a sequel to the prophecy?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Clatter, clatter.</p>
          <p>
            A faint sound of wheels could be heard. Beyond a distant sensation,
            the feeling of being shaken was perceptible. Russ moaned.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            There was no strength throughout his body. How long had he been
            sleeping to feel so stiff? And where was this? Judging by the
            sensation of being rocked, it seemed to be inside a carriage.
          </p>
          <p>‘Why am I lying down in a place like this?’</p>
          <p>
            Wondering, Russ tried to get up. Suddenly, a fierce pain struck his
            abdomen. It was the moment he grimaced and clenched his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah!”</p>
          <p>
            A groan leaked out. The twisted face of his half-brother, Eusus,
            surfaced in his blurry memory. In an instant, all his memories
            flooded back.
          </p>
          <p>
            The moment he awakened his aura, the awe-struck eyes of everyone,
            his own heightened excitement, the blade of Eusus deep in his
            stomach, and the dark blue river water approaching at a terrifying
            speed along with a profound sense of falling…
          </p>
          <p>He remembered. He remembered everything.</p>
          <p>His fingertips trembled.</p>
          <p>‘Eusus, brother…’</p>
          <p>Russ wrapped his head. Desolation was felt before anger.</p>
          <p>
            He knew that Eusus did not acknowledge him. He had gritted his teeth
            more than once under that disdainful gaze always cast his way.
          </p>
          <p>But to harbor hatred, Eusus was too great a knight.</p>
          <p>
            A knight among knights, even someone as disregarded as himself
            couldn’t help but admire his character. How proud had he been to
            hear that such a knight was his brother? And how ashamed had he felt
            for not being able to be the proud brother of that brother?
          </p>
          <p>
            To such a great knight, someone like himself, a mere one-trick
            knight, couldn’t possibly catch his eye as a brother. Thus, he
            thought it natural not to be acknowledged, to be looked upon with
            disdain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, he tried desperately. If he could stand as a knight in
            his own right, if he could obtain a strength that wouldn’t shame the
            sword of Tenes, he thought that even Eusus would eventually
            acknowledge him. This impatience led him to frequently break ranks
            and disobey orders, which only made him more despised and fueled a
            vicious cycle of further impatience.
          </p>
          <p>
            And finally, he awakened his aura. He had achieved what he wanted.
            Now, he stood on equal footing as a brother with Eusus.
          </p>
          <p>
            He thought Eusus would be happy to see him like this. Finally, he
            had become a proud brother worthy of being a sword of Tenes. But…
          </p>
          <p>‘He had no intention of acknowledging me…’</p>
          <p>
            Russ sighed as he looked at the ceiling of the carriage. Waking from
            his dream, the cold truth was clearly visible to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            His brother was not the knight among knights he thought he was. When
            his position as the heir became precarious, he was just an ordinary
            noble consumed by power, ready to stab his own blood brother without
            hesitation. It was ludicrously laughable that he had believed such a
            man to be a great knight and had chased after his recognition alone.
          </p>
          <p>“Kekeke…”</p>
          <p>A hollow laugh escaped him involuntarily.</p>
          <p>Clunk!</p>
          <p>
            The carriage stopped. Suddenly, bright sunlight shone in, and cold
            air entered. Someone had drawn the carriage curtain and was looking
            at him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ was startled. It was a familiar face. A long-haired redhead boy
            with a face so pretty it was almost girlish. It was the boy who had
            been captured as the ‘aura-wielding thief’s’ accomplice.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, Mr. Repen! This knight has awakened!”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 72 ]</p>
          <p>
            Emerging from the carriage, Russ looked at Repenhardt and his party
            with alarm. Repenhardt, upon seeing him, spoke in a calm tone.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re awake. How are you feeling?”</p>
          <p>“Ugh……”</p>
          <p>
            With a stiff face, Russ groaned. He had guessed as much when he saw
            Sillan, but seeing Repenhardt again was still disconcerting. Wasn’t
            this aura wielder an enemy of the Tenes Knight Order?
          </p>
          <p>“Was it… you guys who saved me?”</p>
          <p>
            Russ asked in a gruff voice, his gaze full of wariness, to which
            Repenhardt replied,
          </p>
          <p>
            “We found you drifting in the river, close to death, and pulled you
            out.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed that they were indeed the ones who had saved him. Still
            wary, Russ looked around and asked again.
          </p>
          <p>“Then where is this place?”</p>
          <p>
            It was plains in all directions. It certainly didn’t look like the
            mountainous area of Viscount Kelberen’s territory. He appreciated
            being saved, but why had they brought him here?
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing the dubious and gruff expression on Russ’s face, Repenhardt
            gave a wry smile. Well, it wasn’t an incomprehensible situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is the territory of Baron Baid. It’s already been three days
            since the commotion at Kelberen Castle. It wasn’t urgent, so under
            normal circumstances, it would have been best to wait for you to
            wake up and treat you in an inn or something similar…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt and his party were in hot water for causing a huge uproar
            at the lord’s castle. They couldn’t stay in the viscount’s territory
            since a warrant for their arrest could be issued at any time.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It felt wrong to leave a dying man behind, and given our situation,
            we couldn’t stay in one place either. We thought about leaving you
            at a nearby temple, but Sillan said your injuries were so severe
            that only a priest of his caliber could save you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ felt an odd sensation. The brother with whom he shared blood
            had ambushed him, attempting to take his life, yet the enemy with
            whom he shared a sword had spent money to save him.
          </p>
          <p>
            A peculiar emotion welled up inside his chest. Never in his life had
            he felt such kindness.
          </p>
          <p>Honestly, he was profoundly moved.</p>
          <p>With a rigid face, Russ slightly bowed his head.</p>
          <p>“I sincerely thank you for saving my life.”</p>
          <p>
            He meant to express his gratitude genuinely, but despite his
            intentions, his voice sounded awkwardly stiff.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ugh, this isn’t what I intended,’ Russ thought to himself. Having
            only ever received animosity, he wasn’t used to expressing
            gratitude. Hence, his tone came out bluntly.
          </p>

          <p>
            Fortunately, Repenhardt didn’t seem to mind. Scratching his head, he
            casually gestured towards Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s because he’s quite nice. He’s the one who paid, so thank him.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In reality, he hadn’t contributed a single penny to the purchase of
            the carriage. (Not that he had any money to contribute.)
          </p>
          <p>
            “Now that you’re awake, you should return to your family, right?
            Want me to chip in for your travel expenses?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt made a show of generosity with money that wasn’t even
            his. However, Sillan wouldn’t mind. Besides…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Having the future Sword Saint being indebted to me could bring good
            fortune later, right?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if Russ was Tassid’s enemy, that was a matter of a past life;
            the outcomes in this life were uncertain. Showing kindness here
            meant no loss!
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘After all, I’m the benefactor of his life. At the very least, he
            won’t recklessly attack me as in the previous life.’
          </p>
          <p>At this, Russ showed a troubled expression.</p>
          <p>“Ah, about that…”</p>
          <p>
            Hesitating for a moment, Russ slowly began to explain. He talked
            about being the illegitimate child of the Tenes family, the
            relationship between himself and Eusus, and how Eusus stabbed him
            after he awakened his aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ had long discarded any reverence for Eusus. With a clear mind,
            he could easily guess what Eusus might have done afterwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So… returning to my family might be difficult for me. I will likely
            be branded as a traitor who ambushed the heir.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt stroked his chin in thought. Had something like this
            happened to Cyrus, the Sword Saint? Upon reflection, there had been
            a similar incident. Repenhardt, who had thoroughly investigated
            Cyrus’s history during the era of the Antares Empire, remembered
            even the events of his youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Wasn’t it said that after awakening his aura, he officially dueled
            with his older brother, who was the original heir, and took over the
            family?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s name was so insignificant that it hadn’t even made it into
            that information. Such was the extent to which Eusus had been
            forgotten.
          </p>
          <p>‘It seems history has changed because I intervened.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smirked bitterly. Somehow, ruining Cyrus’s fate felt
            oddly satisfying, yet he also felt a sense of guilt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, it seemed Russ’s life had become quite complicated. Well,
            saving his life was already more than enough, so Repenhardt felt no
            obligation to take responsibility beyond that.
          </p>
          <p>Seeing Russ looking dejected, Repenhardt casually asked,</p>
          <p>“What will you do now?”</p>

          <p>
            Russ looked up at the sky. Not a single cloud could be seen in the
            chilly winter sky.
          </p>
          <p>It was clear.</p>
          <p>‘What should I do?’</p>
          <p>
            Unable to return to his family, Russ felt as if his purpose in life
            had vanished. Everything seemed to be floating in uncertainty.
          </p>
          <p>He was in turmoil, his thoughts tangled and running wild.</p>
          <p>
            Eusus was not the ideal knight Russ had imagined. Even the love of
            his father, upon reflection, seemed dubious. Was it truly love for
            his son, or was it because he saw potential for aura awakening in
            him?
          </p>
          <p>Russ tried to organize his thoughts.</p>
          <p>‘First, I must find a way to return to my family…’</p>
          <p>
            However, if he returned to the Tenes count’s household in his
            current state, he would only be treated as a traitor. He needed
            something solid, a proof of his worth, to present upon his return.
          </p>
          <p>And for a knight, that proof was his skill with the sword.</p>
          <p>Gradually, his thoughts began to clear.</p>
          <p>‘I must become a swordsman with undeniable skill.’</p>
          <p>
            If he returned as a full-fledged aura wielder, even the Tenes County
            could not ignore his presence. So, how could he reach such a level?
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Russ’s gaze landed on Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>
            A formidable martial artist walking far ahead of him, the first true
            aura wielder he had ever met, the man who had shown him the genuine
            path of aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘And, the one who saved me without asking for anything in return…’
          </p>
          <p>Russ made his decision.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s question was merely part of the flow of the
            conversation, not out of any particular curiosity about Russ’s
            future plans. Suddenly, Russ knelt before him, bowing deeply.
          </p>
          <p>“If I am not a burden, please allow me to follow you.”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>Russ continued, addressing the bewildered Repenhardt.</p>

          <p>
            “You are my life’s savior. As a knight, it is my duty to repay this
            debt, but, as one disowned by my family, dedicating my service to
            you is the only way I can repay your kindness.”
          </p>
          <p>“No, there’s really no need to worry about that…”</p>
          <p>
            Had he gone too far in seeking recognition? Repenhardt looked down
            at Russ, perplexed, just as Russ raised his head, his eyes shining
            with determination.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Moreover, it’s thanks to you that I’ve awakened to my aura. You are
            the first true powerhouse I’ve ever encountered, and I wish to
            follow you to further hone my skills.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, he wanted to repay his debt and steal some martial arts
            skills by following him around. Repenhardt stared at Russ,
            dumbfounded. Russ met his gaze squarely, his eyes filled with
            resolve, clearly having thought this through carefully.
          </p>
          <p>“Still, you don’t even know who I am…”</p>
          <p>“Being the heir of Fist King Gerard is sufficient.”</p>
          <p>“But why me? Our specialties are different, aren’t they?”</p>
          <p>
            What could a swordsman possibly learn from a fistfighter?
            Repenhardt’s confusion was justified. Yet, Russ shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What I need is not merely swordsmanship but aura mastery itself.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, as a swordsman, Russ had achieved his awakening by observing
            Repenhardt, a martial artist. The reasoning made sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But, you’re an aura wielder too, right? Can’t you just work on it
            by yourself?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I was just lucky to awaken my aura; I have a long way to go. I’m
            aware of that.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was contemplative. He understood Russ’s situation.
            Awakening to aura was just the beginning; honing and mastering it
            required learning its proper use. Even Repenhardt had spent over two
            years training under Gerard after awakening his aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, Russ would return to his family and seek out aura users in
            the Graim Kingdom to improve his skills. He would receive various
            teachings, face countless real-world challenges, and only after
            nearing his forties would he finally earn the title of Sword Saint,
            standing tall among all swordsmen on the continent.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, now branded a traitor and treated as a criminal by his
            family, that path was no longer possible. His only options were to
            seek teachings from aura users in other countries or wander the
            world alone to enhance his skills…
          </p>
          <p>‘But that foreign aura user… is me, isn’t it?’</p>
          <p>
            Considering aura users weren’t exactly common, it was somewhat
            understandable from Russ’s perspective to approach him in this
            manner. Though Repenhardt, originally a mage, felt awkward about it,
            the truth is that in the martial world, it’s not rare for warriors
            to temporarily pledge themselves to a stronger individual to improve
            their skills.
          </p>
          <p>Russ knelt on one knee before Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>
            “Given my circumstances, I must eventually return to my family, so I
            cannot pledge myself as your vassal. However, until my sword finds
            its place, I will follow your commands and serve loyally. Please
            accept me!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking down at Russ, who voiced his strong will, Repenhardt’s
            expression was ambivalent.
          </p>
          <p>‘Cyrus… The Sword Saint Cyrus is following me?’</p>
          <p>The enemy of his past life, Tassid’s nemesis.</p>
          <p>
            That was Repenhardt’s impression of Cyrus. Though he had saved him,
            Repenhardt had only regarded Russ as a potential future enemy. The
            possibility of him actually choosing to follow had never crossed his
            mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            But upon reflection, why couldn’t it be? After all, everything had
            been reset. They were starting anew. So, there was no reason a
            future enemy couldn’t become an ally.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Especially if he’s a genius swordsman destined to become the Sword
            Saint in the future?’
          </p>
          <p>The more he thought about it, the more appealing it seemed.</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 73 ]</p>
          <p>‘Should I tempt the others over to our side like this?’</p>
          <p>
            He had only thought of them as enemies, but now that things had come
            to this, perhaps it was possible to pull other foes from his past
            lives to his side?
          </p>
          <p>
            He was momentarily enticed by the thought, but soon realized it was
            impractical. For one, the hero Alex and the saint Ellin were either
            not yet born or merely infants at this age. That left only Teslon,
            Cyrus, and the light magician Jade, but since his current body
            belonged to the Martial King Teslon, Teslon was automatically out of
            the equation.
          </p>
          <p>‘Jade, that guy is too sly to even consider having around.’</p>
          <p>
            He might put up with Tassid, but he didn’t want to be on the same
            side as the man who killed Siris! It might lack logic, but emotions
            do play a part, right? Besides, although Jade was called a light
            magician, he was known to be quite cunning. According to the
            information he had gathered in his previous life, despite his title,
            Jade did not hesitate to engage in all sorts of dirty deeds behind
            the scenes.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Repenhardt was lost in these thoughts, Russ looked at him with
            worried eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Did he take offense to my pledge of loyalty only until the
            completion of the sword?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking about it, that statement could also be interpreted as
            saying he’d turn his back on him the moment he took everything he
            could from him. But as long as he didn’t abandon the Tenes family,
            he couldn’t serve him as his lord. This was the best choice he could
            make.
          </p>
          <p>As Russ’s gaze wavered, Repenhardt reached out his hand.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, I’m not exactly talking about loyalty. If it’s just about
            being comrades and traveling together, I’m fine with that.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ’s face brightened as he stood up. With this, he was accepted by
            that powerful aura wielder! From now on, he would follow him and
            absorb everything about him. And then, he would return to his family
            as a proud aura user, a true superhuman!
          </p>
          <p>
            Grasping Repenhardt’s hand, Russ asked with emotion, “May I call you
            ‘hyung’?”
          </p>
          <p>In an instant, Repenhardt’s expression twisted oddly.</p>
          <p>“By the way… how old are you now?”</p>
          <p>“I’ve turned twenty-seven this year.”</p>
          <p>
            Watching Russ answer confidently, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.
            Russ was puzzled by his reaction, but then Repenhardt suddenly
            changed the topic and murmured quietly,
          </p>
          <p>“…I’m only twenty-three.”</p>
          <p>“Whaaat!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ looked at Repenhardt in shock. With that physique, that face,
            only twenty-three? But upon closer inspection, his face indeed
            looked youthful. His robust body had distracted from it, but
            focusing solely on his face, he undeniably appeared to be a young
            man in his twenties. If he had only seen his face, concealed by a
            robe, he wouldn’t have been mistaken.
          </p>
          <p>‘Why didn’t I notice until now?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt touched his chin with a somewhat dissatisfied look on his
            face.
          </p>
          <p>“Do I look that old?”</p>

          <p>
            “It’s more about the vibe… You somehow feel like an older person…”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Russ stammered, Repenhardt clicked his tongue again. Well,
            considering he had the mindset of someone in their fifties, it made
            sense he might give off that impression. He had thought his way of
            thinking had become more youthful since regressing to this time, but
            it seemed others didn’t view him that way.
          </p>
          <p>Russ, looking embarrassed, asked,</p>
          <p>“Then, should I address you as Lord Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>“That sounds a bit strange, doesn’t it?”</p>
          <p>
            Even though Russ had pledged his loyalty, that didn’t make him
            Repenhardt’s servant. Given he would return to his family
            eventually, such a title was indeed burdensome.
          </p>
          <p>“How about ‘Master’? ‘Teacher’?”</p>
          <p>“That’s even stranger, man.”</p>
          <p>
            Both of them looked at each other, perplexed. Repenhardt hadn’t
            thought about it before, but this was the reason Cyrus was known
            throughout the continent as the youngest aura wielder in his
            previous life.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, in the Gym Unbreakable lineage, it was common to awaken
            one’s aura in the late teens to early twenties. So, naturally,
            Teslon or Gerard should have been recognized as the youngest aura
            wielders.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no one ever considered them to be their actual age given
            their towering heights over two meters. Moreover, the successive
            inheritors of the Gym Unbreakable title never bothered to correct
            this fact. After all, being looked down upon for being young is a
            common occurrence in the world of men.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a moment of thought, Russ spoke up with a serious expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Regardless of age, I will call you ‘hyung.’ I don’t find it awkward
            to refer to a senior martial artist who leads the way as ‘hyung.’”
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering both their apparent and mental ages, it wasn’t really
            awkward. Scratching his head vigorously, Repenhardt, somewhat
            annoyed, waved his hand dismissively.
          </p>
          <p>“Do as you like, then.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
          <p>
            With Russ’s decision to join, the others introduced themselves as
            well.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, I’m Sillan. A priest serving Philanence.”</p>
          <p>“Nice to meet you, Sillan.”</p>
          <p>“I’m Siris.”</p>
          <p>“And I’m Tilla.”</p>
          <p>“Hm, both of you are hyung’s slaves?”</p>
          <p>“We’re both his companions. Not some slaves!”</p>
          <p>“…Eh?”</p>

          <p>
            Russ tilted his head in confusion. It wasn’t something Repenhardt
            felt needed explaining right away, so he let it slide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The carriage began to roll again. Although Sillan suggested riding
            the carriage due to his unhealed injuries, Russ decided it was
            better to move around to aid his recovery, so he started walking
            beside Repenhardt. Siris and Tilla were put in the carriage, and
            they resumed their journey northward.
          </p>
          <p>While walking, Repenhardt suddenly asked.</p>
          <p>“Ah, Russ. I’m curious about something…”</p>
          <p>“Yes?”</p>
          <p>
            “Where did you all get the information about the Elucion ruins?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, I was just a low-ranking knight, so I’m not really sure…”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>In the capital of the Graim Kingdom, Templerad.</p>
          <p>
            This city, the largest in the western part of the continent with a
            population of a hundred thousand, was abuzz with a single rumor. The
            renowned Golden Knight had succeeded in exploring the ruins of the
            Silver Age, Elucion, after overcoming various hardships and
            adversities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ancient relics they had acquired were said to be worth enough to
            fill ten carriages if converted into gold and silver. The nobility
            envied the wealth acquired by the Count of Tenes, and the common
            folk were green with envy. In taverns and on the streets, minstrels
            recited tales of their adventures, and in every alley, children
            played with swords painted yellow, shouting, “Take the Golden
            Knight’s sword!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the events that occurred at Kelberen Castle, Eusus’s
            defeat, and Russ’s ambush on him were kept strictly secret. Although
            it was no secret among the nobility, the general populace knew
            nothing of it; they merely continued to praise and extol the Golden
            Knights of Graim.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to this, the internal appraisal of Eusus within his family
            remained unchanged. Even his defeat to Repenhardt did not tarnish
            his reputation. The enormous income had bolstered the family’s
            wealth significantly, pleasing the family elders. Considering his
            opponent was the disciple of Grandmaster Gerard, his defeat wasn’t
            taken to heart. How could a warrior expect to win every battle? They
            simply took this defeat as a lesson for him to strive for greater
            improvement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ’s case was also smoothly glossed over. While there was some
            regret that the Tenes family missed the opportunity to produce an
            aura user, no one doubted Eusus’s word. Everyone cursed the gods for
            bestowing such a talent on such a wild creature and comforted Eusus.
            The head of the family, Count Tenes, simply sighed upon hearing
            Russ’s story and then turned his back.
          </p>
          <p>
            In all respects, Eusus was currently treated as a hero of the
            capital. But the actual “Hero of the Capital” was now in his
            bedroom, kneeling and sweating profusely.
          </p>
          <p>“…This is disappointing.”</p>
          <p>
            A soft yet chillingly cold voice pierced his ears. Eusus bowed his
            head even more apologetically. With his head bowed, he saw the
            translucent outline of two feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am sorry, Silver Sage. It is due to my incompetence that I failed
            to follow your command.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Eusus stood the projection of a handsome young man with black
            hair, looking down at him. It was the very youth who had informed
            Eusus about the Elucion ruins a month ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            “…It is all my fault. Please punish only me and spare my family…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus was sweating coldly. The place he was prostrating himself was
            none other than his own bedroom, a place even more strictly guarded
            than a training ground. The fact that the Silver Sage could project
            his image here freely only increased Eusus’s admiration and fear for
            the sage’s powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the most powerful of mages could not transcend space. At
            present, magic was limited to viewing each other’s images and
            hearing voices through enchanted crystals, and even that required
            the presence of court-level magicians on both sides. The Silver Sage
            was undoubtedly using a powerful artifact from the Silver Age, an
            advanced artifact that even Eusus, seasoned in ruin exploration, had
            never encountered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The mere presence of this projection instilled awe for the Silver
            Sage. Eusus bowed his head even lower. The youth’s projection
            rebuked him with a frosty voice.
          </p>

          <p>
            “The lack of information was not the issue. Nor did I demand much.
            Did I assign you an unreasonable task?”
          </p>
          <p>“I am sorry…”</p>
          <p>
            “Or is it that the Golden Knights of Graim are merely this inept?”
          </p>
          <p>
            With each sneer, Eusus’s brow furrowed more deeply. Despite the
            other party being a Silver Sage, Eusus was also a renowned knight.
            It was not his place to be so arrogantly belittled.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he dared not express anger. After all, the entity before him was
            one who could easily trample the Count of Tenes’s household.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The future of the Tenes family does not seem bright if things
            continue this way.”
          </p>
          <p>“Please, I beg for your forgiveness!”</p>
          <p>A sighing sound came from the youth’s projection.</p>
          <p>“Tsk, tsk…”</p>
          <p>
            After displaying his arrogance, the projection disappeared. Eusus
            couldn’t lift his head for a long time afterward, overwhelmed by a
            terrible anxiety.
          </p>
          <p>He gritted his teeth.</p>
          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>
            In a dark room, devoid of any windows, with all sides closed off,
            stood a young man. It was the very same black-haired youth who had
            appeared as a projection before Eusus. The youth frowned and picked
            up a large crystal from the floor. This was the Phantom Illusionity,
            one of the artifacts from the Silver Age that allowed one to project
            their appearance to any designated location at will.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            The young man, irritated, tucked the crystal into his chest. He
            clicked his tongue and murmured,
          </p>
          <p>“To think that all that effort ended in failure.”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus might have been astonished by the young man’s ability to
            appear and disappear so mysteriously, but in reality, it wasn’t that
            the youth had managed everything so easily. Even if Phantom
            Illusionity was an artifact of the Silver Age, it couldn’t project
            illusions just anywhere. The caster needed to have visited the
            location at least once to send a projection there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, if it was a place in one’s memory, the projection could be
            sent anywhere, which was indeed a miraculous power. But why would
            the young man, who wasn’t Eusus’s wife, have any business going into
            his bedroom? As a result, he had to sneak into the bedroom at night
            and climb over the wall just to memorize the place. Appearing in the
            training ground was also a show; in reality, he had entered three
            hours early and hid there, only pretending to appear just then.
          </p>
          <p>“Pretending to be mysterious is truly a challenging task…”</p>
          <p>
            To appear enigmatic, one must put in a lot of unseen effort. Isn’t
            there a saying about how, though a swan looks graceful on the
            surface, it’s furiously paddling away beneath? The young man felt he
            could relate to that swan’s situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I should never have trusted a half-baked magic swordsman. No wonder
            the Golden Knight was overshadowed by the Sword Saint and eventually
            forgotten.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Muttering to himself, the young man left the room. As a Silver Sage,
            striving to maintain an appearance had led him to this frustration,
            especially since all his efforts didn’t yield the desired outcome.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the young man was well aware of the identity of the
            mysterious figure who had stolen the voice from Elucion. The
            successor to Grandmaster Gerard, a man with a sturdy physique, brown
            hair, and eyes, and an impressively muscular body.
          </p>
          <p>The young man’s expression twisted even more.</p>
          <p>“Repenhardt, the Demon King!”</p>
          <p>
            Outside the room was a luxurious noble’s mansion. It was a grand
            estate with three floors and dozens of rooms, befitting at least a
            duke or marquess. As the young man walked down the hallway, a maid
            saw him and bowed politely.
          </p>
          <p>“Lord Teslon, Duke Iranad is looking for you.”</p>
          <p>
            After managing his expression, the young man offered a gentle smile.
          </p>
          <p>“Please tell him I’ll be there shortly.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 74 ]</p>
          <p>Entering the room, Teslon bowed politely.</p>
          <p>“Did you summon me, Duke?”</p>
          <p>
            The middle-aged man with a genial expression sitting at the table
            opened his mouth to greet him.
          </p>
          <p>“Come in, Teslon.”</p>
          <p>
            With a slightly nervous face, Teslon sat in front of the man, Duke
            Iranad.
          </p>
          <p>
            Duke Iranad, a nobleman with the greatest wealth and power in the
            Graim Kingdom and also seventh in the line of succession to the
            throne, was currently the strongest Aura wielder in the Graim
            Kingdom. Perhaps thanks to this, despite being in his sixties, he
            still maintained the appearance of a middle-aged man. Indeed, except
            for the king, he was the second most powerful man in the Graim
            Kingdom, a man with a friendly appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Duke Iranad looked behind him and gestured with his hand,
            signaling to dismiss all the servants. After a moment, he looked at
            Teslon and his gaze became more serious.
          </p>
          <p>“Sage Restin.”</p>
          <p>
            Internally, Teslon clicked his tongue. The change in title made it
            immediately clear to him why Duke Iranad had summoned him.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, it’s not like I didn’t know.’</p>
          <p>He replied without showing his thoughts outwardly.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sage Aphectus.”</p>
          <p>Duke Iranad’s expression hardened as he continued.</p>
          <p>“Why did you use the Holy Symbol?”</p>
          <p>“It was necessary.”</p>
          <p>
            Hearing Teslon’s brief reply, Duke Iranad was silent for a moment
            before he shook his head and spoke again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You are indeed an extraordinary figure, Sage Restin. In history,
            there was no one who awakened their Aura at the mere age of twenty.
            Moreover, your mastery of magic is not low, and the power of
            foresight you possess is truly remarkable, having greatly aided in
            protecting humanity. Therefore, despite your young age and lack of
            experience, I recommended you as a Silver Sage, and we have accepted
            you. We judged that you hold that much potential for the future.”
          </p>
          <p>“I am well aware.”</p>
          <p>
            Teslon replied with a solemn voice. Suddenly, Duke Iranad raised his
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, the reason you became a Silver Sage is not because of your
            current skills but because of your potential for the future! You are
            not yet worthy to act as a Silver Sage! Do you understand?”
          </p>
          <p>“I am well aware. I am sorry.”</p>

          <p>
            Without any excuses, Teslon readily apologized. Duke Iranad frowned
            for a moment, then his face returned to its usual genial expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of course, since you didn’t cause any great trouble with the Holy
            Symbol, there will be no punishment. However, you should be aware of
            your position.”
          </p>
          <p>“I will be more careful.”</p>
          <p>
            Pleased with Teslon’s compliant attitude, Duke Iranad’s tone
            softened again.
          </p>
          <p>“Then, you may leave now, Teslon.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Your Grace.”</p>
          <p>
            Even as he left the room, Teslon maintained an innocent expression.
            But as soon as the door closed behind him, his expression changed
            drastically.
          </p>
          <p>Muttering with a stern face, Teslon cursed under his breath.</p>
          <p>“Damn it…”</p>
          <p>
            Although he had put on a strong front, in reality, Teslon currently
            had no power to harm the Count of Tenes. It wasn’t without reason
            that he had struggled so much to seem mysterious. Teslon sighed.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I’ve barely become a member of the Silver Sages, but there’s still
            a long way to go…’
          </p>
          <p>Protectors of humanity.</p>
          <p>
            The secret society ruling the continent from the shadows, the Silver
            Sages.
          </p>
          <p>Indeed, their power could undoubtedly make or break a nation.</p>
          <p>The problem was…</p>
          <p>‘I’m still at the very bottom here.’</p>
          <p>He was anxious. Incredibly anxious.</p>
          <p>
            He still remembered that day, six years ago, when he thought he had
            died and then woke up again, the shock of it all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Waking up again as an insignificantly frail boy, and the horror when
            he learned what that boy’s name was.
          </p>
          <p>
            The body he had trusted more than anyone else in the world, as solid
            as steel, was no longer his. All he had was a frail body that seemed
            as if it would break with a mere touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            The profound sense of loss was overwhelming, but what was even more
            terrifying was the worst-case scenario.
          </p>
          <p>
            Becoming the owner of this body meant that the real owner of this
            body could have taken over his!
          </p>

          <p>
            However, there was no way to verify this at the time. Teslon’s body,
            the young Repenhardt, was merely an apprentice wizard, a trainee
            under a magician in Delphia’s Mage Tower. He was practically a
            slave, with no freedom at all. He had neither the power nor the
            money to prove this worst-case scenario.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the despair, he desperately tried. Although he could not
            undergo the training of Gym Unbreakable again, he was still Teslon,
            the Fist King, once one of those who had reached the pinnacle of
            Aura. He mobilized all the enlightenment he had learned to transform
            this weak body of Repenhardt back into a martial artist’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time, he also diligently studied magic. Indeed, his
            brain was worthy of being called that of a Great Sorcerer, to the
            extent of being dubbed a Demon King. In his previous life, Teslon
            was not particularly bright, but once he took over Repenhardt’s
            body, all the magic that seemed like nonsense before suddenly made
            sense to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the age of twenty, Teslon had managed to awaken his Aura a bit
            later than in his previous life and also entered the 4th Circle,
            obtaining the qualifications of an official magician.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as he set out into the world, his first priority was to head
            to the southern part of the Vasily Kingdom, to the Rakid Mountains.
            It was to seek his nightmare of a martial sect, Gym Unbreakable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, he did not meet Gerard directly. The fear of his master
            was already imprinted on his soul, so much so that he could not
            muster the courage to meet him again, even in a different body.
            Instead, he gathered information from a nearby village where Gerard
            frequently visited to purchase goods.
          </p>
          <p>
            In that place, he confirmed it. Gerard was teaching his younger
            self. Moreover, he already referred to his younger self as
            Repenhardt, not Teslon.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a nightmare. The Demon King Repenhardt had undoubtedly
            resurrected in this era, just like himself, once known as the Fist
            King.
          </p>
          <p>
            He wanted to deal with it immediately, but there was no way. The
            opponent had already awakened his Aura and had full control over his
            body. Teslon knew best how strong he had been in his youth. No
            matter how much he had awakened his Aura and mastered magic up to
            the 4th Circle, he was no match for him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He didn’t even consider seeking Gerard’s help. Given his master’s
            character, as long as the body was strong, he wouldn’t care at all
            whether the soul of his disciple had changed or not.
          </p>
          <p>‘I would have done the same.’</p>
          <p>
            Now, with the brain of Repenhardt, Teslon was cunning, but
            historically, the disciples of Gym Unbreakable had similar
            personalities. They spent 10 years getting beaten up throughout
            childhood, the time when human personality is shaped. A person can
            only become simple-minded and ignorant.
          </p>
          <p>He felt utterly despairing.</p>
          <p>
            He was already a fearsome Demon King who had plunged the continent
            into terror. Now, that person had acquired his body, a body as
            strong as steel. Honestly, defeating Repenhardt had been purely a
            battle of endurance. It was only possible to bring him down after a
            prolonged battle, thanks to the sacrifices of his comrades and his
            indomitable physique.
          </p>
          <p>But now, he had even compensated for his only weakness.</p>
          <p>
            Who in the world could stand against him now that he had become
            perfect? Who could prevent the nightmare-like future that was
            approaching?
          </p>
          <p>“We must stop him…”</p>
          <p>Walking down the corridor, Teslon muttered weakly.</p>
          <p>“We must stop him before he fully regains his magical powers.”</p>
          <p>There was still not a complete lack of hope.</p>
          <p>
            ‘No matter how much of a Demon King he might be, it won’t be easy
            for him to regain the magic of his prime with my brain.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Speaking the words himself, Teslon realized how tragic they sounded.
            However, he humbly acknowledged that in his previous life, he had
            indeed been somewhat of a blockhead. Just as he had despaired at his
            changed body, Repenhardt must have despaired at his changed brain.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, Teslon had managed to awaken his Aura even in this frail body.
            It was overly optimistic to assume Repenhardt couldn’t do the
            opposite, especially since he was known as the greatest sorcerer in
            the history of the continent.
          </p>
          <p>‘Missing out on the Voice of Elucion hurts.’</p>
          <p>
            Teslon clicked his tongue. He didn’t know what the Voice of Elucion
            was. In his past life, he had been nothing more than a brute. He had
            no knowledge of complex magical artifacts. All Teslon knew was that
            Repenhardt had obtained that relic from the ruins of Elucion, which
            allowed him to develop the skills of a great sorcerer at such a
            young age.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Voice of Elucion, and the artifacts of the Four Gods. Jade did say
            that the Demon King obtained his power using those Silver Era
            artifacts.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Then he must ensure that those artifacts never fall into his hands.
            Teslon himself didn’t know what the artifacts of the Four Gods were
            used for. However, he knew where they were and what they looked
            like, having seen too much information about the Demon King.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I’ll have to somehow get ahead of him regarding the artifacts of
            the Four Gods.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Pondering, Teslon returned to his room. He wished he could go on an
            expedition to the ruins himself.
          </p>
          <p>‘But I lack the strength for that…’</p>
          <p>
            As a user of Aura, and not neglecting his magic training, Teslon was
            slowly reaching the realm of the 5th Circle. It was clear he was a
            formidable force in his own right, capable of holding his own
            anywhere he went.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, exploring a super-first-class ruin like Elucion was beyond his
            capabilities. Despite having knowledge from his previous life,
            Teslon lacked confidence in his current skills to explore Elucion.
            This was precisely why he had considered utilizing Eusus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the current Repenhardt was in the same boat. Even Eusus,
            with all his knowledge of the ruin, had barely managed to
            successfully explore Elucion by mobilizing knights, magicians, and
            clerics. Truthfully, it would be difficult for Repenhardt’s current
            abilities to explore Elucion alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem was the significant difference in the level of
            information about the ruin between Teslon and Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teslon knew that Repenhardt, before he was called the Demon King,
            was already a renowned ruin explorer. While he himself had some
            expertise in ruin exploration, Teslon’s knowledge was limited to
            strategies for navigating them. However, Repenhardt was familiar
            with the system information of the ruins themselves. By manipulating
            the system and using secretly hidden backdoors, Repenhardt could
            potentially breach any ruin with his current power.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Anyway, I need to grow stronger. Right now, I can’t even face the
            Golden Knight, let alone Repenhardt…’
          </p>
          <p>Walking on, Teslon clenched his fist tightly.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Along the Setellad Mountain Range lied the western highway of the
            Graim Kingdom, where a carriage rattled along the road surrounded by
            plains.
          </p>
          <p>
            A horse of mediocre quality pulled the carriage, and a red-haired
            boy sat dozing off at the driver’s seat, loosely holding the reins.
            Beside the boy, an elf and a dwarf girl sat chatting amicably.
            Alongside the carriage, a young man with a sleek figure and a sword
            strapped to his side kept pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            The young man with the sword, Russ, suddenly brushed his hair back.
            The winter wind felt less chilling, hinting at the approaching
            spring. Russ glanced at the carriage and tilted his head in wonder.
          </p>
          <p>‘What on earth is hyung doing inside there?’</p>
          <p>
            Even a martial artist who has reached a high level of mastery
            doesn’t neglect their daily training. Yet, since joining this group
            three days ago, Russ hadn’t once seen Repenhardt engage in martial
            arts practice!
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout their three-day journey north along the western highway,
            all Repenhardt seemed to do was eat breakfast and then stay inside
            the carriage, eat lunch and then stay inside, and after dinner, he’d
            remain inside yet again. According to him, he had some thinking to
            do, but Russ couldn’t fathom what required so much contemplation
            that it warranted spending all day inside the carriage.
          </p>
          <p>‘Surely, he can’t be meditating for martial enlightenment.’</p>
          <p>
            While it’s widely believed that a martial artist who has reached a
            certain level of expertise needs only mental training and no longer
            needs physical exercise, Russ, as a knight, knew how baseless this
            notion was.
          </p>
          <p>
            One day of idleness leads to a day’s decline in martial skill.
            Enlightenment is essential, but that doesn’t mean lounging around
            will lead to spiritual growth and an improvement in skills. By that
            logic, even a person in a vegetative state could become a martial
            god.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter what anyone says, the foundation of martial arts is the
            physical body. Without a strong body to support it, nothing can be
            achieved. And nothing is eternal against time. Even the most perfect
            body will deteriorate if not trained daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was unlikely that someone as powerful as Repenhardt wouldn’t know
            this, so Russ couldn’t guess why he would skip training for whatever
            he was doing inside the carriage.

          <p>[ Chapter 75 ]</p>
          <p>Russ chuckled bitterly.</p>
          <p>‘Really, he’s been hard to understand from the first day.’</p>
          <p>
            Over the past three days, what perplexed Russ the most was
            Repenhardt’s attitude towards Siris and Tilla. Suddenly, he
            remembered an incident from when they first had to sleep outdoors.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was after a hearty dinner with food purchased from a household
            near the western road. Russ had just put down his bowl and was about
            to stand up when Repenhardt suddenly caught him with a stern voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
          <p>
            “Uh? I was just thinking of swinging my sword around a bit to
            digest?”
          </p>
          <p>Then, Repenhardt flicked his finger and said,</p>
          <p>“Even if you go, you should draw lots first.”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            Russ was puzzled about drawing lots, only to find out it was about
            selecting two people through lots to do the dishes and other chores
            after the meal. For a moment, Russ was dumbfounded. Wasn’t it
            perfectly normal for slaves to do the cleanup? He even thought that
            perhaps Repenhardt was deliberately acting this way to crush his
            spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, a minute later, he realized that was not the case, as he
            wasn’t the only one who had drawn the short lot.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn, lost again.”</p>
          <p>“Today, make sure the dishes are sparkling clean, Mr. Repen.”</p>
          <p>
            “Hey, Sillan. How come you never end up drawing the lot? You messing
            with it or something?”
          </p>
          <p>“Philanence always blesses me. Teehee!”</p>
          <p>“That’s suspicious……”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan, Siris, and Tilla giggled and went off to prepare for
            sleeping outdoors. Holding the dirty dishes, Russ stood there
            blankly, unable to adapt. Repenhardt tapped him on the back.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you doing? We need to go wash the dishes.”</p>
          <p>
            And truly, they went down to a small stream by the roadside, and
            there Repenhardt, with his majestic stature, squatted down and began
            washing the dishes diligently, showing skills not of a novice. This
            bizarre situation was definitely not a joke. Overwhelmed by the
            absurdity, he asked,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Why do you personally do such tasks, hyung, instead of leaving them
            to the slaves?”
          </p>
          <p>This was his answer,</p>
          <p>
            “The world may treat them as slaves, but I never wish to do so. I
            regard them as valuable comrades, and I will continue to do so.
            Russ, if this bothers you, I fully understand if you decide to leave
            me.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Because of that, Russ had no choice but to wash the dishes alongside
            him. What could he say when offered to leave if he disliked it? How
            slaves were treated was entirely up to their master, so he couldn’t
            complain. It’s said that among those who have reached the pinnacle
            of martial arts, there are quite a few eccentric ones, and that
            seemed to be true.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he gazed at the carriage, reminiscing about that time, Russ
            chuckled and shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>‘After all, it’s not my place to worry.’</p>
          <p>
            He was still uncertain about what kind of person Repenhardt was. It
            was true that he was difficult to understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            But at least one thing was clear: he had sworn loyalty to him.
            Though it might be limited, it was undoubtedly a knight’s oath.
            Therefore, regardless of who Repenhardt was, he had to offer his
            loyalty. As he had sworn, until his swordsmanship was perfected.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Until that day, he is my lord. Till then, I should simply follow
            his will.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Having comfortably settled his thoughts, Russ drew his sword. A blue
            light slowly streamed along the blade. With the blade aura drawn,
            Russ followed the carriage.
          </p>
          <p>Hum, hum, hum.</p>
          <p>
            Initially stable, the blade aura began to waver over time, making
            irregular noises. It was indeed challenging. Russ continued to focus
            on the aura, sweating. While talent played a significant role in
            manipulating the aura freely, enduring its maintenance required no
            sense, only patience and continuous practice until becoming
            accustomed to it.
          </p>
          <p>Russ took a deep breath and exhaled, steadying his breathing.</p>
          <p>‘It’s been three days of continuous practice. This isn’t easy.’</p>
          <p>
            But Russ soon brightened up his expression. Considering Repenhardt’s
            feelings, he couldn’t complain about such a trivial matter.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the first day he was accepted by Repenhardt, he was thoroughly
            taught how to maintain uniform aura. Though there was a difference
            between fists and swords, this task of aura uniformity was
            essentially a basic practice applicable to Russ as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            How moved had Russ been at that time? Of course, this technique
            wasn’t a secret of Gym Unbreakable but rather a common secret among
            aura users, so it wasn’t as if teaching it was leaking any faction’s
            techniques. From Repenhardt’s perspective, there was no issue in
            teaching it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, from Russ’s standpoint, it was entirely different. Being
            taught a technique the day they met meant Repenhardt genuinely
            accepted him, and more than the teaching itself, the kindness shown
            was even more touching.
          </p>
          <p>
            Always treated as an outcast and ignored, never having the chance to
            learn even basic swordsmanship and having to steal glances to learn
            by himself, such kindness was a first for Russ.
          </p>
          <p>Even while sweating, Russ smiled pleasantly.</p>
          <p>
            He had accepted him. He trusted him and showed him kindness and
            grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was enough. It was more than enough reason for him to follow
            him.
          </p>
          <p>‘Does it matter what kind of person he is?’</p>
          <p>Well, that aside, there still remained a question.</p>
          <p>‘Anyway, what really is he doing in there?’</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Contrary to Russ’s thoughts, Repenhardt was indeed meditating inside
            the carriage. Of course, the reason he was meditating was not to
            attain some nonsensical martial enlightenment.
          </p>

          <p>
            In the dimly lit, curtain-drawn carriage, after sitting in a
            full-lotus position with his eyes closed for a long time, Repenhardt
            suddenly opened his eyes and murmured.
          </p>
          <p>“Huff… My mana is replenished enough, so let’s try again.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt touched a black box placed at his feet. It was the Voice
            of Elucion, an artifact from the era of silver. With his finger on
            it, Repenhardt recited the activation words he had memorized over
            the past three days.
          </p>
          <p>“Switch on.”</p>
          <p>
            As the designated command was uttered, light began to flow from the
            Voice of Elucion. The box lit up in various places, emitting a light
            and spreading a powerful magic field around. A spherical magic field
            engulfed Repenhardt whole and filled the inside of the carriage.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt recited another command.</p>
          <p>“Challenge. Level 1. For beginners.”</p>
          <p>
            At the same time, his vision was filled with bright light. The
            place, which was once a dark carriage, turned into a room filled
            with bright light. Repenhardt looked around and muttered,
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m getting quite tired of this virtual reality. Maybe it’s time to
            change the background.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As he brought his fingers to the air, a console made of light
            automatically appeared. After pressing a few buttons on the
            illusionary console, the surrounding environment suddenly changed.
            Instead of a white room, a sandy beach unfolded, and the blue waves
            lapped at the shore, filling his view. There were even blonde elf
            beauties, scantily clad, barely covering the essentials with thin
            fabric, laughing and walking along the beach. Repenhardt grinned
            broadly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, if I’m choosing a background, might as well make it
            pleasing to the eye, right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt already knew, having deciphered the ancient language,
            that what was being worn was commonly donned by women of the Silver
            Age for swimming. The idea that women of that era could present
            themselves in public in such attire spoke volumes of the blessed
            times they lived in.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, activating the Voice of Elucion was not merely for the sake
            of visual pleasure. Repenhardt found a suitable spot on the beach.
            After all, this beach was a kind of simulated reality created by
            magic; no matter how much he moved, his actual body remained
            immobile, seated cross-legged inside a carriage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt settled into his position, his expression turning
            serious. Taking a deep breath to heighten the tension, he gestured
            into the air. Ancient script soon floated above the beach.
          </p>
          <p>Welcome to Magical Beat!</p>
          <p>
            Accompanied by a burst of loud music, colorful boards began to fall
            from the sky. Repenhardt clenched his teeth and waved his hands.
          </p>
          <p>“Wind, become bullets and strike the enemy! Aero Bullet!”</p>
          <p>
            The 1st-circle wind spell, Aero Bullet, flew into the air and hit a
            blue board. The board vanished into thin air, exploding like a
            firework. Repenhardt cast another spell.
          </p>
          <p>“Gather, blaze of heat! Fire Arrow!”</p>
          <p>
            A fiery arrow flew, hitting a red board. The red board also exploded
            in the air, creating a burst of flames. Repenhardt prepared and
            launched spells in succession. Aero Bullet, Fire Arrow, Magic
            Missile, Aqua Ball—all of them were beginner 1st-circle spells. Each
            spell hit its target board, causing explosions. With each hit, the
            music thumped, adding rhythm to the spectacle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The speed at which the planks fell became faster and faster.
            Repenhardt’s complexion grew increasingly stern. The number of
            planks plummeting became too much for the speed of his magical
            casting to keep up. Eventually, when a plank pierced the sandy
            beach,
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            An explosion occurred. Of course, since this was a simulated
            reality, the explosion had no real effect on Repenhardt. However…
          </p>
          <p>“Oh! My God!”</p>

          <p>“What is this!”</p>
          <p>“Do it properly!”</p>
          <p>“Is this all you can do!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, blonde elf beauties were scolding Repenhardt in
            Ancient language, making a fuss. Even though he knew it was a
            simulated reality, it was hard for a man to endure being nagged at
            by women. If only Repenhardt didn’t understand Ancient language, but
            he was a person unrivaled in the field of linguistics! He fully
            understood even the nuance of criticism in their tones.
          </p>
          <p>“Grrr!”</p>
          <p>
            Grinding his teeth, Repenhardt continued to intercept the falling
            planks with magic. He had already missed three planks. And each
            time, the elf beauties scowled and nagged even more.
          </p>
          <p>“Already the third one!”</p>
          <p>“My goodness! To miss so many!”</p>
          <p>“Aren’t men supposed to handle at least this much with ease!”</p>
          <p>Ah, it’s really annoying.</p>
          <p>
            “…Maybe I should have just turned on youth mode and not bothered
            with the eye candy.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt tried to ignore the beauties’ criticisms and continued to
            intercept the falling planks with his magic. Then, it happened.
          </p>
          <p>
            The last plank hit the Aqua Ball, creating a huge firework unlike
            any before, exploding in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>Bang! Boom! Bang!</p>
          <p>
            Numerous fireworks beautifully adorned the sky above the beach. At
            the same time, a cheerful Ancient language was heard from beyond the
            sky.
          </p>
          <p>Congratulations!</p>
          <p>Repenhardt let out a sigh of relief.</p>
          <p>“Ah, I’ve finally succeeded.”</p>
          <p>
            The beauties approached Repenhardt with bright smiles, starting to
            act coquettishly.
          </p>
          <p>“Congratulations!”</p>
          <p>“You really are amazing!”</p>
          <p>“You did it! Incredible!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt frowned. Regardless of the beauties clinging to him, he
            immediately gestured into the air. Instantly, the beach scenery
            vanished, and the world changed back into a white room. Clicking his
            tongue, Repenhardt tapped the floor lightly.
          </p>
          <p>“The Voice of Elucion is indeed of good quality but…”</p>
          <p>
            After tapping the floor twice, suddenly, the white room disappeared,
            and darkness enveloped everything. The virtual reality was gone, and
            they were back inside a carriage covered with curtains. Repenhardt,
            who was clearly standing before, was now sitting cross-legged.
            Opening his eyes, he continued to grumble.
          </p>
          <p>“There are too many unnecessary features.”</p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt soon relaxed his expression. At this moment, he
            had almost succeeded in casting all 1st circle spells in just 1 or 2
            seconds within the virtual space. This casting speed was on par with
            that of a formal magician. Such an achievement was absolutely
            impossible with the dense Teslon’s spell computation abilities.
          </p>
          <p>Picking up a box, Repenhardt smiled contentedly.</p>
          <p>
            “After all, there’s nothing better than this for training spell
            computation abilities.”

          <p>[ Chapter 76 ]</p>
          <p>
            Strassand was a crucial military and commercial hub located at the
            crossroads of the western highway of the Graim Kingdom and the
            northern trade routes of the Setellad mountain range. True to its
            reputation as the northern gateway of the Graim Kingdom, the streets
            were lined with inns and taverns. In the backyard of one such inn,
            four men and women were deeply engrossed in a sparring session.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your left side is open, Russ!” a youth, towering a full head taller
            than an average adult, shouted sharply as he swung his right hand
            down. A faint golden aura enveloped his blade as it surged towards
            the shoulder of Russ, a young man wielding a sword. Grimacing, Russ
            twisted his body to dodge the attack before thrusting back.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s the heart, hyung!” A long sword, radiating a blue hue, struck
            precisely into the chest of the burly youth, Repenhardt. Swinging
            his left hand to deflect the blade, Repenhardt exclaimed, “A fine
            counterattack! But your aura is wavering! Your power shouldn’t
            diminish even when you’re attacking!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yes, hyung!” Repenhardt, while critiquing, continued to engage Russ
            in the sparring. He felt a bit guilty for neglecting him for the
            past three days, and he himself felt the need to get his body back
            in shape. Russ, too, was earnestly feeling out Repenhardt’s
            movements and the flow of his aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, at a corner of the yard far from these two, two girls
            were fiercely dueling with wooden swords and an axe. They were Siris
            and Tilla.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The head!” With a short shout, Siris swung her wooden sword. It was
            a makeshift weapon given by Repenhardt until he could buy her a
            splendid sword, ever since hers was taken at Kelberen Castle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though it was just a wooden sword, Repenhardt did not hesitate to go
            to great lengths to create it. He broke a whole mature tree that had
            been growing well for hundreds of years and carved the trunk into
            the shape of a scimitar, infusing it with aura. The idea of felling
            an entire tree just to make one wooden sword? Sillan was astounded
            by such folly, his mouth agape, while Russ gave a thumbs up,
            admiring the martial spirit and generosity. This cold-looking youth,
            who had apparently been scolded a lot, now saw everything Repenhardt
            did as magnificent, as long as he was being nice.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Siris shouted, her wooden sword aimed for Tilla’s head flew
            through the air. Tilla, with a spirited shout, stomped the ground.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            As soon as she dodged the wooden sword aimed at her head by jumping
            back, Tilla propelled herself forward again. The speed of her
            movement, retreating then returning to her spot so quickly, was so
            fast it almost seemed like she had never moved at all. Then, Tilla
            swung her battle axe, shouting,
          </p>
          <p>“Shoulder! Waist!”</p>
          <p>
            Tilla, though small for a human, wielded the giant battle axe, which
            would usually require both hands, with ease. Well, in truth, Tilla
            was considered a mature lady by dwarf standards, but she looked
            merely a girl to anyone else. With this decidedly unbalanced
            appearance, Tilla pressured Siris’s shoulder and waist
            simultaneously.
          </p>

          <p>
            Even if it were not a wooden sword, it would be nearly impossible to
            counter such consecutive heavy blows. Siris danced around in zigzags
            to avoid the attacks. Each of her evasive moves was also a
            preparation for a counterattack, leaving Tilla no chance to land a
            follow-up hit. After creating some distance, Tilla said with a
            smile,
          </p>
          <p>“Wow, in technique, I’m nowhere near Siris’s match.”</p>
          <p>Siris responded with a bright smile,</p>
          <p>
            “But the difference in the destructive power of a single blow is too
            vast; I can’t find an opening to exploit. I heard about the
            bloodline of the Dwarf warriors in my childhood, and it’s truly
            remarkable.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The last remaining warrior of the Steelhammer clan, Tilla de
            Steelhammer. Her skills were surprisingly exceptional. Despite her
            appearance, her attacks, powered by her incredible brute strength,
            were unavoidable, and dodging them left very little room for
            counterattack. Even Siris, known for her delicate swordsmanship,
            found it difficult to face her.
          </p>
          <p>
            After catching their breath, the two clashed again. They were in the
            spacious backyard of an inn, having rented an entire outbuilding, so
            they were free from the gaze of others and could fully immerse
            themselves in the sparring session. Since the sparring session
            involved indicating attack positions in advance, there was little
            risk of injury, and in case of any mistakes, there was a top-grade
            medicine bottle right beside them. It allowed them to enjoy the
            sparring without any pressure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, that top-grade medicine bottle was sitting in a corner,
            sulking.
          </p>
          <p>“Martial artists must enjoy never being bored…”</p>
          <p>
            Without an opponent, and also being a cleric, Sillan was yawning out
            of boredom. Watching the fight was fun at first, but after tens of
            minutes, it became tedious. Noticing Repenhardt’s glances, Sillan
            quietly stood up.
          </p>
          <p>“Maybe I should train too…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt immediately caught on and yelled.</p>
          <p>“I told you to rest!”</p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t that Sillan had been just lazing around. He had already
            completed a basic muscle training schedule, including doing push-ups
            twenty times in five sets, and standing up from a sitting position
            one hundred times, as scheduled by Repenhardt. Sillan was in quite a
            sore state, with muscles aching all over his body. Pushing his body
            further would only make him sick.
          </p>

          <p>
            But for Sillan, who used to push his body to the brink of illness
            whenever possible, it felt insufficient.
          </p>
          <p>“No, I can just heal myself with healing magic…”</p>
          <p>“Did I not say? No healing magic allowed.”</p>
          <p>
            After escaping from Viscount Kelberen’s castle, Repenhardt began to
            take a more serious look at Sillan’s condition. The most important
            part of this new regimen was the prohibition of using healing magic
            after training. He was frank about the mechanism of holy spells, but
            the problem was that Sillan was skeptical of his words. Well, it was
            understandable. Sillan was a high-ranking cleric himself, and it was
            doubtful that Repenhardt, a mere fighter, would know about holy
            spells that even Sillan was unaware of.
          </p>
          <p>“Um…”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing Sillan still looking unconvinced, Repenhardt asked him
            seriously.
          </p>
          <p>“Sillan.”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>“Whose body is better, mine or yours?”</p>
          <p>“Yours, Mr. Repen.”</p>
          <p>
            “Then, who do you think knows how to build a better body? You or
            me?”
          </p>
          <p>“You, Mr. Repen.”</p>
          <p>
            “Then try to trust me a bit. If it hasn’t worked for 5 years, it’s
            about time you realized something’s wrong, right?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan might not believe in the details about holy spells, but when
            it came to building a body, Repenhardt was indeed an expert. Sillan
            humbly decided to acknowledge this fact and sat down again.
            Repenhardt gave a wry smile and turned his attention back to Russ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just then, a middle-aged man entered the courtyard unexpectedly.
            Everyone looked puzzled, and after the man glanced around, he asked
            a question.
          </p>
          <p>“Excuse me. I heard that a person named Repenhardt is here?”</p>
        </div>
        <div

          <p>[ Chapter 77 ]</p>
          <p>
            The middle-aged man glanced around the group and immediately
            recognized Repenhardt, approaching him. Indeed, Repenhardt had a
            distinctive appearance that made him easy to spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan, who had been watching from the side, asked, “Was this who
            you were waiting for?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, I have some personal matters to investigate.”</p>
          <p>
            Upon arriving in Strassand, Repenhardt checked into an inn and
            immediately contacted the Taoban Trading Company. He wanted to
            retrieve information about the current young Repenhardt, a request
            he had made previously. The Taoban Trading Company’s Strassand
            branch said they would contact the headquarters in Zeppelin, located
            in the Chatan Principality, and asked him to wait for about three
            days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Between Strassand and Zeppelin lay the rugged Setellad Mountains.
            Sending a messenger on horseback for a round trip would take about a
            month. The three days mentioned by the Taoban Trading Company were
            not for sending someone to Zeppelin but for the round trip to a
            wizard’s tower near Strassand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like most trading companies, the Taoban Trading Company had
            long-term contracts with wizards’ towers across the continent to
            facilitate fast communication through magical orbs. To send
            information, one first had to go to the nearest wizard’s tower and
            from there, contact another tower near Zeppelin. Then, a messenger
            from that tower would deliver the message to the headquarters. The
            Chatan Trading Company and the Rolpein Trading Company, competing
            for the top two positions on the continent, often stationed wizards
            at each of their branches to save time, but the Taoban Trading
            Company was not yet that large.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the three days of waiting time, Repenhardt suggested they
            take this opportunity to stay in Strassand and recover from their
            travels, to which everyone happily agreed. They had spent nearly ten
            days eating and sleeping on the road, so everyone was longing for a
            proper bed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, it’s been a long time spent in leisure. It’s about time to
            depart.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching Sillan’s slightly disappointed expression, Repenhardt
            couldn’t help but chuckle. He then led the middle-aged man to a
            corner of the courtyard. The man pulled out a small bundle of
            scrolls from his possession and handed it over.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Here are the documents you requested. Please sign here for
            confirmation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After signing the document handed to him, Repenhardt received the
            bundle of papers. They weren’t sealed with a seal. Since using a
            crystal ball to communicate would inevitably allow magicians and
            messengers to see the contents, truly important secrets were still
            conveyed through personal delivery. What Repenhardt had requested
            wasn’t particularly secret, so it seemed to have been sent in the
            form of an ordinary scroll.
          </p>
          <p>“You’ve worked hard to come all this way.”</p>
          <p>
            After handing over some coins to the messenger as a token of
            appreciation, Repenhardt unfolded the scroll. His expression grew
            increasingly stern as he read.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scroll contained detailed information about the current, young
            Repenhardt. The first thing that caught his eye was an event from
            when he was sixteen.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘A mysterious mental illness had caused him to lose his self and go
            berserk…’
          </p>
          <p>
            At first glance, it was the period when he had time-traveled, the
            moment he entered this body. Moreover, what stood out the most was
            the name he had screamed.
          </p>
          <p>‘He insisted he was not Repenhardt but Teslon?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue. He had suspected as much, but having
            it confirmed left a bitter taste in his mouth. There’s no way the
            young Repenhardt of this era would know the name Teslon.
          </p>

          <p>This made it certain.</p>
          <p>
            Teslon, the Fist King, had resurrected in this era! Just like
            himself! Inhabiting his own body!
          </p>
          <p>‘Che, I had wondered, but it turns out I was right…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt unconsciously touched his temple. Although he had
            sufficiently anticipated it, seeing it with his own eyes still came
            as a shock.
          </p>
          <p>He quickly read through the remaining part.</p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t uncommon for magicians to lose their sanity slightly.
            Losing one’s self or becoming mentally unstable due to dealing with
            transformation or mental magic was quite common among novice
            magicians. Thus, it seemed the incident involving the young
            Repenhardt, or rather Teslon, wasn’t considered a major issue.
          </p>
          <p>
            A few days later, Teslon showed his intelligent demeanor again and
            returned to the path of a magician. Until he turned twenty, he
            didn’t exhibit any noteworthy behavior. At twenty, unusually young
            for a magician, he became a full-fledged magician and left the tower
            of Delphia. After that, there was no further news of him.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It seems they couldn’t find out what happened after that. Well,
            it’s not like they’re a professional intelligence agency; they
            probably just picked up rumors along the way, so it’s understandable
            that they couldn’t find out more.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Knowing the most crucial fact was enough. As he folded the
            documents, Repenhardt pondered for a moment. There was one point
            that bothered him.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘He became a full-fledged magician at twenty and left the tower?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, his becoming an official magician happened in his late
            twenties. It was not until he was twenty-six that he finally left
            the tower. Of course, mastering the 4th circle by the age of twenty
            wasn’t surprising. He had done so in his previous life. However,
            magicians don’t easily let go of their apprentices. There’s no
            reason to release an obedient servant who does everything as told
            early.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, in his previous life, Repenhardt was trapped in the tower
            until his mid-twenties before he could finally enter the world. Of
            course, his innate talent allowed him to grow tremendously fast
            after that, reaching the level of a great magician. However, it was
            impossible for him to become an official magician at twenty. It
            wasn’t due to a lack of skill but because the higher-ups didn’t
            allow it.
          </p>
          <p>‘What trick did Teslon use, exactly?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt frowned. He hadn’t been overly concerned about the
            possibility of Teslon being resurrected in this era because he
            thought, at the very least, Teslon would be trapped in the tower of
            Delphia for another 5-6 years, unable to do anything. However, if
            this information was true, it implied that Teslon had entered the
            world even earlier than expected.
          </p>
          <p>‘We’ll need more information…’</p>
          <p>
            But the information obtained through the trading company had its
            limits. To acquire more detailed information, professional
            assistance was necessary. Fortunately, the continent had a specific
            profession dedicated to tracking people: bounty hunters.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I should get a recommendation for a competent bounty hunter through
            the Taoban Trading Company.’
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>‘Ah, right, my financial situation…’</p>

          <p>
            He was out of money. Hiring a bounty hunter privately would require
            a significant sum. Essentially, he would need to offer a bounty.
          </p>
          <p>
            To hire someone competent, he would need at least two hundred gold
            coins, but Repenhardt was nearly penniless. Currently, all his
            travel expenses were being borrowed from Sillan. The investment in
            the Taoban Trading Company wouldn’t pay off until spring, which was
            still over three months away.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Sigh, looks like I’ll have to hit up the Grand Forge and raid a
            ruin or something.’
          </p>
          <p>
            After roughly planning his next moves, Repenhardt put his thoughts
            aside. Heading to the Grand Forge was the priority for now.
          </p>
          <p>‘Let’s stop worrying and focus on what I need to do.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt activated his aura. A golden aura covered the bundle of
            papers, which soon blackened and turned to ash. After burning the
            documents, he turned around, and Russ asked him,
          </p>
          <p>“Are we leaving Strassand now?”</p>
          <p>Glancing at the sky, Repenhardt nodded.</p>
          <p>
            “Yes, we have many things to prepare. Let’s depart tomorrow
            morning.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
          <p>
            Russ bowed deeply and then headed back to the lodging. Watching his
            back, Repenhardt’s expression hardened.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s about time I told the others about our real destination.’</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            In the annex rented out entirely for their stay, Repenhardt and his
            companions were gathered in the living room after dinner, preparing
            for their departure the next morning. Russ was busy maintaining his
            sword and armor, while Tilla and Siris were organizing the travel
            supplies they had purchased in the afternoon. Repenhardt hadn’t
            specifically asked them to do this, but such tidying up was best
            left to those who voluntarily took it upon themselves, as it tended
            to be somewhat lacking when left to the men.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan was animatedly chatting beside Russ. True to his outgoing
            personality, Sillan had continually engaged Russ in conversation
            throughout their journey, and by now, they had become quite close.
          </p>
          <p>
            “When I first met Mr. Repen, I thought he was just a country lad.
            Then he suddenly took off his top and started beating demons, wow!
            It was truly amazing!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah! That’s our hyung for you. To possess such strength and yet
            remain humble, concealing his power.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know if it was humility, but he certainly was hiding his
            strength. After beating that demon…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan was eagerly recounting to Russ his first encounter with
            Repenhardt. Russ, seemingly under a spell, would let out small
            sounds of admiration. After all, when had Russ ever engaged in
            gossip? Though he didn’t show it, he seemed to be quite enjoying the
            conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meanwhile, Repenhardt was looking at his companions with a serious
            expression on his face.
          </p>
          <p>‘What should I do…’</p>
          <p>
            Currently, Sillan, Russ, and Siris believed that Repenhardt was
            moving to explore a ruin in the northern part of the Setellad
            Mountains. Although Repenhardt had never made such a claim, his
            actions thus far had painted him as an excellent ruin explorer,
            leading them to naturally assume they were on a quest to uncover
            relics from the Silver Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the real reason Repenhardt was heading to the
            northernmost part of the Setellad mountain range was to find the
            Grand Forge. The Grand Forge was a sacred site of the dwarves, a
            marvel among marvels that absolutely must not be revealed to humans.
            Siris, being an elf, was no issue, but Russ and Sillan were humans,
            and it wasn’t a place to casually bring them. Tilla had been hinting
            at this continuously during their travels, whether they really
            intended to bring them all the way to the Grand Forge.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was time to make a decision about the treatment of Sillan and
            Russ.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt resolved.</p>
          <p>‘These are my companions.’</p>
          <p>Repenhardt spoke up in a serious voice to his group.</p>
          <p>“I have something to say.”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at him curiously. Repenhardt took a moment to catch
            his breath. Then, he continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What we are heading to isn’t actually a relic of the Silver Age.”
          </p>
          <p>“Eh? It was?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan looked slightly surprised by Repenhardt’s words. Russ,
            speaking on his behalf, asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Then, are we not heading to the Setellad mountain range, hyung?”
          </p>
          <p>“No, the destination is correct.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan and Russ looked at each other with the same expression. If
            not for a relic of the Silver Age, then what else could possibly be
            in that remote of remote locations? Repenhardt nodded.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know what you’re thinking. And, before I say this, I must first
            talk about my dream, my life’s goal.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at Repenhardt with curious eyes. Repenhardt glanced
            at each of their eyes in turn: Sillan, Siris, Russ, and even Tilla.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt swallowed. Then, as calmly as he could, he continued.
          </p>
          <p>“I do not consider elves, dwarves, or orcs as slaves.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan and Russ instinctively nodded. They had seen Repenhardt
            exhibit this behavior time and again throughout their travels
            together. It wasn’t an awkward conversation at all.
          </p>
          <p>“And, I want others to think the same way I do.”</p>
          <p>
            This time, it was a bit confusing. Both Sillan and Russ blinked.
            Wondering if he had been too roundabout, Repenhardt let out a wry
            smile. Then, he bluntly stated it.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Creating a world where elves, dwarves, and orcs are not slaves,
            that is my dream and my life’s goal.”

          <p>[ Chapter 78 ]</p>
          <p>
            Silence lingered. Everyone looked at Repenhardt with bewildered
            eyes, not opening their mouths. Only Tilla was softly smiling.
          </p>
          <p>After a moment, Russ stuttered and asked.</p>
          <p>
            “Hyung, I’m a bit lost here. So, are you saying you want to release
            elves, dwarves, and the like into the wild?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt let out a bitter smile. Yes, that was the expected
            reaction. He was no longer angry about it. He quietly replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            “They have intellect and emotions, just like humans. Russ, ‘wild’ is
            a term that should be applied to animals.”
          </p>
          <p>“Eh, well, that’s true but…”</p>
          <p>
            Russ scratched his head vigorously. The idea was so out of the blue
            that he couldn’t organize his thoughts. To him, treating other races
            as equals rather than slaves sounded as absurd as treating the
            livestock he raised at home as humans. The only difference, perhaps,
            was that these ‘livestock’ could talk.
          </p>
          <p>It was natural to be perplexed.</p>
          <p>‘Why? What for?’</p>
          <p>
            Russ pondered. He knew that many among the aura users had quirky
            personalities, but this seemed a bit too much. He even began to
            doubt whether he had made the wrong choice.
          </p>
          <p>On the other hand, Sillan looked surprisingly understanding.</p>
          <p>“It kind of makes you think, it’s very Repen-like.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan had already encountered many different races alongside
            Repenhardt. He had realized that what he knew and the reality were
            quite different. He wasn’t enraged enough to despise the society
            that enslaved elves and orcs, but he could at least feel that
            something was fundamentally wrong with the societal perception that
            simply labeled them as mere slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now Sillan could understand why Repenhardt dreamed of such things.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it’s one thing for Repenhardt to feel this way, and another
            to change the world to feel the same! Sillan asked with a stern
            face.
          </p>
          <p>“So, Mr. Repen, do you want to change the world?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>“It’s not just about secretly releasing the slaves, right?”</p>
          <p>
            “It could come to that if necessary. But that’s not my ultimate
            goal.”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt looked around at everyone and slowly began to speak.</p>
          <p>
            “If need be, even if it means fighting the world, I want to achieve
            this dream. That’s why I’m asking you.”
          </p>
          <p>And he asked in a solemn voice.</p>

          <p>“Will you follow my cause?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Everyone remained silent, lost in thought. Seeing this, Repenhardt
            pondered.
          </p>
          <p>‘Did I unnecessarily bring this up?’</p>
          <p>
            There was no real need to discuss such matters. He could have simply
            found a plausible excuse to separate Sillan and Russ, then quickly
            visit the Grand Forge alone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, he did not wish to do so. He felt compelled to persuade the
            world. If he couldn’t even convince a few of his companions, even if
            they couldn’t accept his views, if they at least couldn’t understand
            him, then his dream had no chance. He would have to become the Demon
            King again, once more engulfing the continent in flames and
            establishing a dark empire.
          </p>
          <p>‘This was a conversation that needed to happen eventually.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked at Sillan. Truthfully, there was little chance
            that Russ would understand him. They hadn’t known each other for
            long, and Russ had hardly been exposed to other races. Frankly,
            Repenhardt had no expectations there.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Sillan was different. Unbeknownst to him, Repenhardt had
            continuously shown Sillan that the reality he knew was incorrect. He
            had persistently conveyed that elves and orcs, in fact, have
            intellect and emotions like humans, and they possess their own
            cultures and traditions.
          </p>
          <p>
            At least, Repenhardt thought he had sufficiently persuaded Sillan.
            Would the boy understand him?
          </p>
          <p>
            With anxious eyes, Repenhardt looked at Sillan. This was not merely
            about gaining a comrade who shared his beliefs. It was almost like
            determining whether he could tread a path different from his
            previous life!
          </p>
          <p>Finally, Sillan spoke.</p>
          <p>“I will follow Mr. Repen.”</p>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, it wasn’t Repenhardt but Siris who was astonished.
          </p>
          <p>“Sillan?”</p>
          <p>Sillan continued calmly.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, I don’t completely agree with Mr. Repen’s dream. Honestly, I
            think it’s a far-fetched dream. But, as Mr. Repen said, I do feel it
            strange that in this world, other races are merely slaves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There were experiences he had had. The feelings he had felt. Sillan
            smiled wryly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Besides, as a pilgrim traveling the world, how often do you come
            across a companion with such grand aspirations?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan had chosen the path of a pilgrim to spread the teachings of
            Philanence. For most clerics who embarked on pilgrimages, the aim
            was to gain fame and leave a name in the annals of the church as a
            saint, driven by a sense of honor. Though this wasn’t the sole
            reason for Sillan’s journey, it didn’t mean he was devoid of any
            desire for honor.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Sillan’s expression turned playful.</p>
          <p>“Elves, dwarves, orcs, they all have males and females, right?”</p>
          <p>
            Curious about what he was about to say, everyone’s attention turned
            to him. Sillan continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, elves, orcs, dwarves, they all can love, right? Then, we must
            spread the teachings of Philanence! I don’t completely believe Mr.
            Repen can change the world, but by following him, wouldn’t I meet
            numerous hidden other races? This could be an opportunity to become
            the first person in the history of the church to spread the faith
            among other races. How could I pass up this chance?”
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone was speechless. This was an utterly unexpected reasoning.
            Repenhardt wore a mixed expression. Was this considered a proper
            persuasion, or not?
          </p>
          <p>“Anyway, you’re saying you’ll follow me?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            “Even if it’s dangerous? Even if it earns the hatred of humans? What
            if we have to attack nobles to free all their slaves?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt asked, wondering if Sillan had underestimated the
            seriousness of their endeavor. However, it seemed that wasn’t the
            case. A calm reply came back.
          </p>
          <p>“If Mr. Repen deems it necessary, I’m willing to help.”</p>
          <p>“Even though it’s essentially theft?”</p>
          <p>“Just make sure to cover my face.”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing Sillan smiling gently, Repenhardt smiled back. It seemed his
            first gamble in this life was paying off. The declaration of
            spreading faith to other races was an unequivocal acknowledgment of
            their personhood.
          </p>
          <p>‘Have I done it…?’</p>
          <p>
            It was a small step, but a correct one. Pleased with himself,
            Repenhardt turned to Russ.
          </p>
          <p>‘Now, it’s this guy’s turn.’</p>
          <p>
            Russ still wore a confused expression. It was to be expected. Unlike
            Sillan, Russ hadn’t had the proper time or context for persuasion.
            If he had claimed to understand, that in itself would have been
            suspicious.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had no intention of dismissing Russ at this point. If he
            was willing to part ways after just a week, he wouldn’t have
            accepted him in the first place.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a gentle voice, Repenhardt asked, “You don’t quite understand,
            do you, Russ?”
          </p>
          <p>Hesitating at first, Russ eventually nodded in agreement.</p>
          <p>“Yes, hyung.”</p>
          <p>
            “That’s expected,” Repenhardt nodded as if understanding Russ’s
            perspective completely.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s not that I’m asking you to understand me right away, nor am I
            demanding immediate allegiance. You haven’t seen anything yet, nor
            have you heard much. It’s natural to be confused.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike with Sillan, Repenhardt hadn’t shown him various things, nor
            had he discussed the truth about other races. Suddenly proclaiming
            ‘Other races are not slaves! Believe it! Just believe!’ would be
            something a cult leader might do.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, convincing Russ on the spot was too big of a challenge due
            to the deep-seated beliefs. It wasn’t something that could be
            resolved in a few words, and Repenhardt didn’t expect that.
          </p>
          <p>
            What he hoped for from Russ was simpler. Repenhardt spoke, “You
            swore to follow me. Then, observe with your own eyes as we proceed.
            Make your own decisions. All I ask is that you do not betray me
            until that moment comes.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He was serious but then let out a small laugh, “Well, by betrayal, I
            don’t mean anything grand. Just remain tight-lipped. A lot of what
            we’ll discuss going forward is quite secretive.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hyung…”</p>

          <p>
            Russ met Repenhardt’s gaze, his eyes steady. They were too full of
            determined will to simply dismiss as those of a peculiar individual.
            The look in his eyes was not that of a madman.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the fact that Sillan was convinced bothered him. No matter
            how he thought about it, it sounded like nonsense, but Repenhardt’s
            confidence was too unwavering. It was clear he believed that
            following him would lead to understanding.
          </p>
          <p>After a moment, Russ came to a decision.</p>
          <p>“I, too, will follow you, hyung.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt did not force Russ to accept his views. He merely asked
            him to observe and judge for himself. This request was far from
            unreasonable.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Honestly, I can’t grasp what you’re saying, hyung. But I have
            already sworn my loyalty to you. I may not understand your
            intentions, but I’ve realized that doesn’t justify betraying you.”
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Russ kneeled earnestly in front of Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>
            “Wherever you lead, that is the path I will follow. This fact will
            not change until I return to my family!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ exclaimed, his voice filled with unwavering resolve. It was a
            truly knightly gesture, promising to uphold his oath of loyalty
            regardless of whom he faced.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan shuddered with an expression that screamed ‘cheesy’.</p>
          <p>‘Wow, talk about knightly dialogue…’</p>
          <p>
            Regardless, this meant that both Sillan and Russ were now on board
            with Repenhardt’s intentions. They might not fully share his vision,
            but at least they had become trustworthy companions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relieved, Repenhardt loosened his shoulders. Despite trying to
            appear unfazed, it seemed he had been quite tense.
          </p>
          <p>‘Now, we can speak freely.’</p>
          <p>Feeling liberated, Repenhardt began to speak.</p>
          <p>
            “Our next destination is the Grand Forge, a sacred place of the
            dwarves and the temple of their chief deity, Al Fort. It’s among the
            highest secrets, not to be disclosed to humans. You understand why I
            had to bring up this lengthy explanation, right?”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The northernmost reaches of the Setellad mountain range were terrain
            so harsh that humans dared not tread. Rugged mountainsides, sheer
            cliffs scattered throughout, and ancient coniferous forests,
            possibly hundreds or even thousands of years old, stretched
            endlessly. With thick mists rising above this vast forest, even the
            hardiest of humans would hesitate to set foot here.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the depths of a forest shrouded in mist, where the sunlight
            struggled to penetrate even in the afternoon, a massive monster was
            roaring.
          </p>
          <p>“Woah!”</p>
          <p>
            A gigantic humanoid monster, over three meters tall, known as an
            ogre, was enjoying its hunt. This creature, which relished in eating
            humans and possessed the brute strength to kill beasts like tigers
            with its bare hands, was now leading dozens of its kind in a charge
            through the forest. All of them appeared furious, incensed by the
            audacity of the ‘humans’ who had dared to trespass into their
            territory.
          </p>
          <p>
            The leading ogre, wielding a tree trunk-sized club, charged at the
            forest’s intruders. Each swing of its club stirred up a whirlwind,
            making a loud whooshing sound. Suddenly, a young girl, peculiarly
            busty for her age, swiftly moved forward to confront it. In her
            hands, she held a pair of battle axes nearly as big as herself,
            which she crossed over her head as she shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Earth! Grant me strength!”</p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The ogre’s club came crashing down on the girl’s battle axes.
            Astonishingly, she easily blocked the ogre’s blow. Despite her small
            stature, she exhibited a strength comparable to the ogre’s. Not
            stopping there, she repelled the club and swung her battle axes,
            deeply cutting into the ogre’s abdomen.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaah!”</p>
          <p>
            The ogre screamed as its innards spilled out. A young boy with red
            hair, watching from behind, clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Really, I can’t get used to it no matter how many times I see it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The dwarf girl, Tilla, could momentarily amplify her strength by
            communing with the earth. Being a descendant of the earth spirits,
            this was a skill possible for a dwarf. Despite being a slave, Tilla,
            who inherited the blood of warriors, still held the secrets of her
            ancestors.

            Tilla swung her battle axe vigorously, scattering blood left and
            right before charging again towards the other ogres.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            As Tilla leaped among the ogres, her battle axe continuously
            splattered blood into the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside her, Siris was also engaging other ogres. Clumsy wooden clubs
            targeted her repeatedly, each one thicker than her body. A mere
            brush would cause fatal injuries, rupturing her internal organs.
            However, Siris skillfully maneuvered through the gaps in the
            attacks, swinging her sword.
          </p>
          <p>“Hah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a clear yell, her silver scimitar danced. Though the scimitar,
            newly purchased in Strassand, was neither mithril nor a significant
            magical weapon, it was a quality sword forged by a competent
            blacksmith. Its silver blade sequentially sliced through the ogres’
            limbs and tendons, spilling fresh blood.
          </p>
          <p>
            As time passed, Tilla and Siris began to slow down, evidently
            fatigued. Sillan once again raised a prayer with a resonant shout.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Philanence, protect them! Make their arms endlessly strong and let
            their hearts beat like dragons!”
          </p>
          <p>
            A pinkish holy light enveloped Siris and Tilla, revitalizing their
            movements to peak condition. Currently, Sillan was enhancing both
            Tilla and Siris simultaneously from behind. Considering that
            ordinary priests could only bless one person at a time, Sillan’s
            capability was remarkable. In fact, Sillan had once managed to bless
            twenty knights simultaneously at full power; this was not
            particularly challenging for him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Sillan continued to support Tilla and Siris while casually
            checking the situation elsewhere.
          </p>
          <p>‘Are they doing well over here?’</p>
          <p>
            Behind him, a blue blade aura flashed repeatedly, eliciting screams.
            If Tilla was using brute force to confront ogres head-on and Siris
            opted for hit-and-run tactics, Russ was completely overpowering the
            ogres with his tremendous skill.
          </p>
          <p>“Hup!”</p>
          <p>
            With a short yell, Russ launched himself into the air. Quickly
            reaching eye level with a three-meter-tall ogre, Russ extended his
            blade aura. Although the ogre tried to block with its club, the
            destructive light from Russ’s blade not only sliced through the club
            and the ogre’s neck but also cut off the forearm of another ogre
            standing behind.
          </p>
          <p>“Kraak!”</p>
          <p>“Kruk!”</p>
          <p>
            As soon as Russ dealt with two ogres in a single breath, he spun his
            body in the air. Normally, such a maneuver would be impossible
            without a foothold, but he managed to change his stance using the
            recoil from unleashing his Blade Aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            While spinning, he instantly sliced an incoming club into three
            pieces and poured out a flurry of consecutive attacks. The flow of
            his power was so natural, it was as if he had always practiced this
            technique. The way his spontaneous action flowed so naturally was a
            testament to Russ’s extraordinary talent. Even Repenhardt wouldn’t
            be able to move like this without practice. Of course, Repenhardt
            might have simply taken a hit from a club and then delivered a
            painful counterattack.
          </p>

          <p>Whooooosh!</p>
          <p>
            The Blade Aura whined through the air like a whip. The ogres being
            cut also moaned in pain. Facing the majority of the ogres alone,
            Russ was overwhelmingly dominating the situation. Sillan inwardly
            marveled,
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Indeed, an Aura user is still an Aura user. Ogres are no match for
            him.’
          </p>
          <p>High-spirited, Russ decapitated an ogre’s head and bellowed,</p>
          <p>
            “Hmph! You filthy monster, you dare target a human blessed by
            Seiya!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, what kind of textbook knightly dialogue is that? Why do they
            all say the same thing?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing the cringe-worthy dialogue, the admiration Sillan felt
            retreated. He twisted his lips and then looked afar, about 30 meters
            from where the battle was taking place, in a clearing within the
            forest.
          </p>
          <p>
            There, Repenhardt was engaged in a fierce battle with a gigantic
            monster. It was a hydra, over 10 meters long with eight heads.
          </p>
          <p>Fwooooosh!</p>
          <p>
            With a loud noise, one of the hydra’s heads spewed flames.
            Repenhardt, embracing the head with both arms, charged forward.
            Jumping over the hydra’s head, he remained unscathed by the flames.
          </p>
          <p>“My body is like steel! Do you think mere flames can harm me?”</p>
          <p>Boasting boldly, Repenhardt swung his fist.</p>
          <p>“Force Strike!”</p>
          <p>
            The Aura bullet hit one of the hydra’s heads, causing a loud
            explosion. That wasn’t the end. After launching the Force Strike,
            Repenhardt grabbed the hydra’s head with both hands and continued
            pounding. Each punch had the power to dent even steel. The hydra
            staggered, trying to bite at Repenhardt with its other heads.
          </p>
          <p>“Kaaooo!”</p>
          <p>
            In the moment the three heads rushed towards him, Repenhardt instead
            grabbed one of the hydra’s heads and rolled his foot. With both arms
            wrapped around the head, he kicked off the hydra’s shoulder and
            leaped down. No matter how gigantic the monster was, it couldn’t
            escape the principles of leverage; the creature’s center of gravity
            shifted forward, causing the massive hydra to topple over.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt, fueled by his momentum, let out a boisterous cry.</p>
          <p>“Urat-chara!”</p>
          <p>
            Holding onto the hydra’s head, Repenhardt then threw the creature
            completely over him. A man not even two meters tall had executed a
            throw on a ten-meter monster. Sillan, watching from a distance,
            doubted his own eyes at the ludicrous scene.
          </p>

          <p>‘Oh my, can that gentleman really do such a thing?’</p>
          <p>
            How often would a hydra experience being thrown on its back in its
            lifetime? Naturally, it received the full impact of its own weight.
            The hydra, falling onto its back for the first time, let out a
            piteous scream.
          </p>
          <p>Gwaaaack!</p>
          <p>
            With eight mouths, the scream sounded almost like surround sound.
            Despite the successful hit, Repenhardt’s expression didn’t look
            particularly bright.
          </p>
          <p>‘Oh dear, am I going mad? Why did I shout that?’</p>
          <p>
            My body is like steel; indeed, a sane person would be too
            embarrassed to say such a thing. It seemed he might have been overly
            influenced by Gerard. Reflecting on this, Repenhardt glared at the
            fallen hydra. Just then, a voice came from above.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m coming, hyung!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ, having already dealt with an ogre, leapt into the air to
            assist him. Dashing through the air, Russ swung his long swords left
            and right. The blade aura stretched out like a whip, successively
            slicing through the fallen hydra’s heads.
          </p>
          <p>
            It had been almost a month since Russ learned about aura usage from
            Repenhardt. By now, he had reached the level of extending and
            altering the form of his aura. Considering it took nearly a year for
            Repenhardt to reach this stage, the progress was infuriatingly fast.
          </p>
          <p>‘That’s why they say geniuses are unbearable.’</p>
          <p>
            Witnessing Russ master in less than a month what had taken him a
            year, Repenhardt felt a strange mix of emotions. Never in his
            previous life had he envied anyone’s talents, so this was a
            surprisingly fresh sensation for him. Perhaps now he could
            understand the feelings of the other magicians who had observed him.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it wasn’t that Repenhardt felt inferior to Russ. Their
            talents differed, but his body, bestowed with the legacy of Teslon,
            was certainly not lesser in quality than Russ’s. Moreover, as a
            magician and warrior, he had no reason to envy the qualities of
            others, though lately he felt his identity shaking a bit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ’s blade aura continued to slash at the hydra, splattering blue
            blood everywhere. Yet, the hydra did not die.
          </p>
          <p>“Grrrrr…”</p>
          <p>
            Despite the brutal impacts and injuries from Russ’s blade aura, the
            hydra slowly began to rise again. Even a regular wild animal would
            have remarkable vitality, making it impossible to bring down with a
            single strike unless a vital point was precisely targeted.
            Especially, a creature like the hydra could rise again even if
            several heads were severed.
          </p>
          <p>“Tch…”</p>
          <p>
            Russ grimaced and backed off for the moment. The hydra roared in
            pain, anger, and humiliation.
          </p>
          <p>“Kaaaa!”</p>
          <p>
            Frantically swinging its heads, the hydra unleashed breaths in all
            directions. Acid and corrosive fluids, flames and frost, and bolts
            of lightning successively targeted Russ and Repenhardt. While Russ
            hastily dodged, enveloping his body in aura for protection,
            Repenhardt charged forward.
          </p>

          <p>“Spiral Guard!”</p>
          <p>
            This defense technique, which ignored the nature and type of
            attacks, could only be penetrated by strikes with enough piercing
            power to disregard rotational force. Unfortunately for the hydra,
            its breaths did not possess such power. Deploying the Spiral Guard,
            Repenhardt deflected all attacks and swiftly closed the distance
            between them. Reaching right up to it, he stomped down hard with his
            left foot.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Planting one foot into the ground like a giant tree, Repenhardt
            twisted his entire body, focusing all his strength into a single
            point. With that posture, he delivered a kick that landed on the
            Hydra’s torso!
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The wave of aura pierced through the Hydra’s heart, and a majestic
            explosion echoed. Blood, flesh, and fragments of innards shot up
            into the air as if a volcano had erupted. No matter how strong its
            vitality, a creature couldn’t live without its heart. After
            instantly slaying the Hydra, Repenhardt turned around to see Siris,
            Sillan, and Tilla running towards him from a distance, having
            defeated the ogres and joining him.
          </p>
          <p>“Is everyone alright? Any injuries?”</p>
          <p>
            It seemed that there were no wounds. Indeed, with Siris and Tilla’s
            abilities, enhanced by Sillan’s blessing, they could easily handle
            about half a dozen ogres. After all, Russ had dealt with most of
            them.
          </p>
          <p>After checking everyone’s condition, Repenhardt gestured.</p>
          <p>
            “Let’s move on then. We need to get out of this forest quickly.”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            After escaping the foggy forest, Repenhardt and his companions
            decided to take a brief rest near a small valley. By a stream, they
            replenished their water supplies and chewed on the emergency rations
            they had brought along. They did not start a fire, wary that the
            smoke or smell might attract monsters.
          </p>
          <p>Chewing on some jerky, Sillan shook his head.</p>
          <p>
            “Wow, this place is really harsh. It seems worse than most ruins
            I’ve known.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It had been fifteen days since they left Strassand, and a week since
            they ventured deep into the Setellad Mountains. During that week,
            Repenhardt’s party had already been attacked over thirty times by
            monsters. At first, they encountered common monsters like goblins,
            harpies, and krolbears, which posed no significant threat. However,
            as they ventured deeper, more powerful monsters appeared, including
            packs of ogres and even rare beasts like hydras.
          </p>
          <p>
            After drinking water from his canteen, Repenhardt replied as if it
            were a matter of course.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, it’s a wilderness untouched by humans. It’s no wonder even
            the dwarves choose to live away from human reach at this point.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “But can dwarves really live in such a place? We’re moving through
            it, but how can a dwarf…” He paused, quickly adding, “Not that I
            doubt you, brother.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Just follow along. You’ll understand once you see for yourself.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ still seemed incredulous that dwarves ‘of all creatures’ could
            inhabit such rugged terrain. Although he had acknowledged that
            dwarves could have warriors after seeing Tilla’s strength, changing
            his underlying perception of dwarves was not easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, they were all taking a brief rest. Suddenly,
            Repenhardt grimaced.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn, can’t they even let us rest for a moment?”</p>
          <p>
            Russ also stood up, grasping his sword. Looking up at the sky, he
            murmured with a stern face.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s a phantom griffin.”</p>
          <p>
            From afar, the screeching sounds grew loud as a group of monsters
            approached from the sky.

          <p>[ Chapter 79(Part 2) ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s party was not dealing with a common menace, as they
            faced a flock of Phantom Griffins overhead. With the body of a lion,
            the wings of a bird, and the head of an eagle, griffins were fairly
            common monsters throughout the continent. Typically preying on
            horses and cattle, they incited the wrath of farmers, and due to
            their ability to fly, they were not easily caught. However, any
            competent order of knights could handle them without much difficulty
            using baits, arrows, and nets; under such strategies, griffins posed
            little threat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, the Phantom Griffins currently dominating the skies above
            Repenhardt and his group were no ordinary beasts.
          </p>
          <p>“Squawk!”</p>
          <p>
            As the Phantom Griffin screeched, circling in the air, it looked no
            different from a regular griffin. The problem, however, was the four
            identical griffins mimicking every flap of its wings surrounding it.
          </p>
          <p>
            All five griffins moved in unison, swooping down simultaneously.
            Russ leaped into the air, swinging his sword.
          </p>
          <p>“Begone, beast!”</p>
          <p>
            With the agility typical of an aura user, Russ soared over ten
            meters into the air, scattering a blade of aura. A whip of blue
            light swiftly sliced through one griffin, causing it to vanish into
            thin air. At that moment, the others simultaneously spewed venom
            from their beaks.
          </p>
          <p>“Screech!”</p>
          <p>
            Four streams of venom shot towards Russ, who used the recoil of his
            aura to dodge them all. The misfired venom fell accurately across
            the ravine, corroding only one particular spot.
          </p>
          <p>“Fzzzt!”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt also clenched his fists, releasing his aura.</p>
          <p>“Chain Burst Shot!”</p>
          <p>
            Golden orbs of aura targeted the Phantom Griffins. Each hit caused a
            griffin to disappear into the ether. Some staggered and screamed
            when hit, but they were just a few among the many.
          </p>
          <p>“Nihillen!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris also activated the magic bow Nihillen and continuously shot
            arrows of light. Indeed, Siris’s archery had reached such a mastery
            that hardly any arrows missed their mark, but the result was not
            much different from that of Repenhardt. Most of the arrows struck
            the ‘illusory clones’ of the phantom griffins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Among the magical beasts, there were those born with magical power
            who, without any reasoning, could instinctively use magic that was
            imprinted in their blood. The phantom griffins were such monsters,
            capable of using illusion magic, Mirror Image, by utilizing their
            innate magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Mirror Image was impossible to discern even with the heightened
            senses of aura users. Unlike Eusus, the phantom griffin
            instinctively activated its magic without a specific magical
            pattern. Since there were no incantations, there couldn’t be a
            pattern. This left Repenhardt without any way to identify the real
            body.
          </p>
          <p>Flap! Flap! Flap-flap-flap!</p>
          <p>
            With the loud flapping of their wings, the phantom griffins
            continued to assault Repenhardt and his group. Repenhardt, Russ, and
            Siris kept attacking, driving the creatures back. Tilla, unable to
            attack from a distance, clung closely beside Sillan to protect him.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt shouted.</p>
          <p>“I’ll use magic! Russ, cover me for a moment!”</p>
          <p>
            Startled, Russ hesitated for a second, then nodded and responded.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, hyung!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ blocked in front of Repenhardt and sent blades of aura in all
            directions. Seizing the moment, Repenhardt stepped back and began to
            chant a spell while forming hand signs.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Getella de Passid Form. O mirror that reflects the truth, cast
            forth your light! Illusion Annihilation!”
          </p>

          <p>
            Above Repenhardt’s head, a light green mirror of light formed. The
            mirror rotated in all directions, shining on the phantom griffins.
            Each time it did, the illusions around the griffins disappeared like
            morning dew.
          </p>
          <p>“Ke, keack?”</p>
          <p>“Krak! Kraralack!”</p>
          <p>
            The Phantom Griffins began to break their ranks in confusion,
            suddenly left unprotected as their illusions vanished. Russ muttered
            to himself, observing the scene.
          </p>
          <p>“Every time I see it, it feels awkward, that thing.”</p>
          <p>
            It was when he first entered the Setellad Mountains. Encountering a
            demon of the spirit type, Russ had been swinging his sword when he
            was shocked. Suddenly, Repenhardt began to unleash fire magic on the
            spirits. How astonished he had been! A warrior exceptional enough to
            awaken his aura was also skilled in magic!
          </p>
          <p>Sillan nodded understandingly.</p>
          <p>“I was surprised too. He used to cast magic so poorly before…”</p>
          <p>
            The ‘Illusion Annihilation’ that disrupted the illusion magic was a
            fourth circle advanced spell, which only a fully qualified mage
            could cast quickly in real combat. It had been less than two months
            since they had struggled just to open a door in the ruins of
            Elucion.
          </p>
          <p>“Suddenly he casts magic as if he’s a full-fledged mage?”</p>
          <p>Then Sillan suddenly smirked and shook his head.</p>
          <p>“But it’s still premature…”</p>
          <p>
            Sure enough, Repenhardt was shouting angrily as he cast his magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hey! What are you all doing? My mana is running out! Hurry up and
            attack!”
          </p>
          <p>
            It had only been a few seconds since the magic was cast, and the
            mirror of light was flickering on and off, threatening to go out.
            Although his casting speed had increased tremendously, his mana
            hadn’t improved much. Russ quickly moved into action. Siris also
            chuckled and picked up Nihillen. The scene was like children
            stomping their feet in frustration.
          </p>
          <p>‘Sometimes he does something cute, that man.’</p>
          <p>
            Of course, now was not the time for such leisurely thoughts. Siris
            returned to a serious expression and repeatedly pulled the
            bowstring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the illusions were gone, the Phantom Griffins were no different
            from ordinary griffins. They were easily dealt with. After knocking
            down about three or four, the rest of the Phantom Griffins began to
            flee in fear.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching the receding flock of phantom griffins, everyone sighed in
            relief. They then looked at each other with grim expressions.
            Indeed, this land was not easy. Even with Siris’s divine protection,
            battling consecutively without proper rest was exhausting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone found spots to sit and rest. As Siris transformed Nihillen
            into a stick, she asked Tilla in a weary voice, “How much farther do
            we need to go?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “At least another fortnight,” Tilla replied, her face somber.
            Although chosen as the guide, Tilla had never been to the Grand
            Forge herself; she only knew its location and the route from
            stories. The journey was tougher than she had anticipated.
          </p>
          <p>At the mention of another fortnight, even Russ looked pale.</p>
          <p>
            “Do we have to endure more attacks like these for another
            fortnight?”
          </p>
          <p>Just then, Repenhardt shook his head.</p>
          <p>“No, we won’t be going that way.”</p>
          <p>“What?” Everyone looked puzzled, even Tilla.</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt flicked his finger and continued, “There’s a shortcut.
            Just about a day more to go, so keep your spirits up.”
          </p>

          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            No longer following Tilla’s guidance, Repenhardt boldly took the
            lead and guided the party through the valley. After being ambushed
            about half a dozen times, they somehow managed to fend off the
            beasts. A day later, they arrived at a large cliff. Pointing to a
            cave at the base of the cliff, Repenhardt announced,
          </p>
          <p>“Here we are, we’ve arrived.”</p>
          <p>
            The cave did not look natural at all. Its walls were smooth, and it
            was perfectly diamond-shaped, with even signs of things having been
            hung from the ceiling. It would be foolish to not realize the
            identity of this place.
          </p>
          <p>Russ muttered as he looked inside the cave,</p>
          <p>“It’s a relic from the Silver Age.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, it’s definitely a relic,”</p>
          <p>
            Siris looked up at Repenhardt, fascinated. She had always felt that
            her ‘unusual master’ was different from other relic hunters. It was
            as if he knew everything and explored relics in such a manner.
            Typically, finding a relic involved gathering all sorts of
            information, combining it, and searching various places just to
            pinpoint the location. However, Repenhardt had not wandered at all
            on their journey here. He ran straight to this spot, certain that
            there was a relic.
          </p>
          <p>Unable to contain her curiosity, Siris cautiously asked,</p>
          <p>“How did you know about this place, Lord Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>
            Tilla seemed to know nothing about this place either. It wasn’t
            information from the dwarves then. So, where had Repenhardt obtained
            such information?
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, I just picked up bits and pieces of information here and
            there.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But it seemed Repenhardt had no intention of telling her the truth.
            As always, he simply evaded giving a straightforward answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was slightly irritating. Why was it that he could be so
            affectionate at times, confusing people, and yet at times like this,
            he would never share anything important?
          </p>
          <p>‘I don’t know…’</p>
          <p>I don’t know.</p>
          <p>What this person is thinking.</p>
          <p>
            Why he is so affectionate yet reveals nothing, keeping secrets to
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris stared at Repenhardt with wide eyes. Repenhardt tilted his
            head and then grinned broadly. What could possibly be so amusing?
          </p>
          <p>I really don’t know.</p>
          <p>‘What does this person think of me?’</p>
          <p>And…</p>
          <p>‘What do I think of this person…’</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Standing at the entrance of the ruins, Russ drew his sword.</p>
          <p>“I’ll take the lead. Please cover the rear, hyung.”</p>
          <p>
            It was common knowledge that the strongest should be at the
            forefront and rear when exploring ruins. That Russ would say this as
            they were about to enter the ruins was only natural.
          </p>

          <p>However, Repenhardt scratched his cheek.</p>
          <p>“Well, I appreciate the enthusiasm, but…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt walked over to the wall at the entrance of the ruins and
            fiddled with something. Suddenly, the wall slid open, revealing a
            passage.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We’re not actually going inside the ruins; we’re supposed to head
            to the outskirts.”
          </p>
          <p>Russ was astonished and asked, “What, how did you do that?”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at Repenhardt, clearly flustered. Repenhardt knew
            this reaction was coming and calmly fabricated a story.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My master explored this place when he was young. He didn’t explore
            everything, but he knew quite a bit about various ruins. He told me
            about this passage.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone seemed to accept his explanation. Gerard, the Fist King,
            was once renowned as an explorer of ruins, so it was natural for him
            to pass on such knowledge to his only disciple.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I guess I just need to blame everything on the master when I
            pretend to know something in the ruins.’
          </p>
          <p>Of course, Siris was still puzzled.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Just something he heard? He seemed to know too much for that, as if
            he had been here before…’
          </p>
          <p>
            But Repenhardt was oblivious to the change in Siris’s expression as
            he pointed towards the outer passage and gestured for the group to
            follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright, this place isn’t completely safe either, so don’t let your
            guard down. Let’s go in.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The party cautiously entered the passageway. Similar to Elucion,
            various monsters emerged from the secret passage, but their strength
            was inferior compared to those they had encountered in the Setellad
            Mountains. The creatures were no match for a group that included two
            aura users.
          </p>
          <p>
            After about half a day of effortlessly dispatching the monsters
            while walking down, the passageway ended, revealing a large hall.
            Dim light leaked from several spots in the ceiling, barely
            illuminating the interior. Numerous pillars were lined up, but
            curiously, the tops of the pillars were separated from the ceiling,
            meaning they were not meant to support the ceiling.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan looked around and asked,</p>
          <p>“Is this the Grand Forge?”</p>
          <p>Tilla shook her head.</p>
          <p>“No, this isn’t like the place I’ve heard about.”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone was perplexed when Repenhardt walked confidently towards
            one of the pillars. Observing ancient inscriptions on it that read
            “Hockril,” he seemed contemplative for a moment before suddenly
            channeling his aura and delivering a powerful punch!
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The pillar collapsed in a single strike. Everyone rushed to him in
            surprise.
          </p>
          <p>“What, what is it? Hyung?”</p>
          <p>
            “What’s going on, Mr. Repen? Why did you do that all of a sudden?”
          </p>
          <p>As everyone was bewildered, Sillan’s eyes widened.</p>
          <p>“What’s this?”</p>
          <p>
            A faint light seeped out from the broken pillar. Just as everyone’s
            eyes widened in unison, a dazzling light suddenly enveloped them.
          </p>
          <p>“Kyaa!”</p>
          <p>“Hoek!”</p>
          <p>
            Screaming, they all took defensive positions. The light quickly
            filled the room and then disappeared. Tilla blinked and murmured,
          </p>
          <p>“What was that, what have you done…”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Tilla’s words stopped short. The surroundings had
            transformed. They were no longer standing in a large hall.

          <p>[ Chapter 80 ]</p>
          <p>
            The vast cavity was a huge space, easily 50 meters tall. The floor
            was neatly laid out with high-quality granite bricks, and a massive
            temple was visible in front.
          </p>
          <p>
            Giant pillars supported the structure on all sides, amidst which
            various statues stood majestically. They depicted dwarf warriors,
            armed with hammers and axes. The statues, over 5 meters tall, were
            so finely crafted that their beards seemed to flutter with life.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the center of the temple, Tilla gazed in awe at the large emblem
            of flame engraved there.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is the temple of Lord Al Fort… Could this be the Grand Forge?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Understanding seemed to dawn at last. Among the relics of the Silver
            Age, there were those that distorted space, linking distant points
            instantly. Likely, the light emanating from the broken pillar had
            such powers. Russ murmured in reverence.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Truly, the Silver Age… to travel a distance of over a fortnight in
            a mere moment…”
          </p>
          <p>
            The group marveled as they examined their surroundings. They were on
            the western ruins of the temple. Or, rather, it didn’t seem quite
            right to call it ruins. While extensively damaged, the dirt and
            stones were still freshly scattered, with rocks tumbling down and
            broken edges crisp—indicating recent destruction.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Sillan grimaced.</p>
          <p>“Mr. Repenhardt…”</p>
          <p>“Hmm? What?”</p>
          <p>“Could this destruction be because of us?”</p>
          <p>“Exactly.”</p>
          <p>“What? We did this and it’s okay?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan gaped at Repenhardt, who chuckled and waved his hand
            dismissively.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. It’s all in the prophecy…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s expression suddenly hardened.</p>
          <p>‘Wait a moment?’</p>
          <p>
            Now, he had come to the Grand Forge, just as he remembered from his
            previous life. Back then, even after demolishing the temple, Al Fort
            had provided all necessary prophecies.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now? The prophecies of Al Fort had completely changed. It
            occurred to him that the dwarves would unlikely understand this
            situation!
          </p>
          <p>Sure enough, from a distance came a loud cry of anger.</p>
          <p>“The temple has been destroyed!”</p>
          <p>“Intruders!”</p>
          <p>“Everyone, repel the intruders!”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone glared at Repenhardt in unison. He awkwardly laughed as
            sweat poured down his face.
          </p>
          <p>“Ahaha, hahaha…”</p>

          <p>
            The sound of noisy footsteps echoed from the passages connected to
            the cavity. While Siris, Sillan, and Tilla only listened to the
            noises, Repenhardt and Russ, who could manipulate aura, could
            clearly discern the positions and numbers of their opponents.
            Approximately fifty dwarves were swiftly closing their encirclement.
            They each hid behind pillars and walls, exuding a thick aura of
            killing intent.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as the encirclement was formed, one of the dwarves shouted
            with a resonant voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Open fire on everyone!”</p>
          <p>
            No sooner had the command been given than dozens of arrows flew
            toward the group. They all turned pale and hid behind the ruins of
            the collapsed temple. Sillan grumbled, ducking his head.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, these dwarves are so impulsive…”</p>
          <p>
            Even if they were intruders, was it normal to shoot arrows without a
            word?
          </p>
          <p>
            “Isn’t there usually some expected dialogue in these situations?
            Like asking who we are or telling us not to move… What kind of
            people start shooting without saying a word?”
          </p>
          <p>Ting-ting, tang-tang.</p>
          <p>
            The arrowheads clinked against the stone walls, creating a clear
            sound. Repenhardt, trying to defend the dwarves’ actions, swatted
            away the incoming arrows and retorted.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Would you have the leisure to chat if someone just wrecked your
            house and barged in?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, wasn’t it you, knowing full well the consequences, who caused
            this madness?”
          </p>
          <p>“…When you put it that way, I have nothing to say.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt awkwardly continued to deflect the arrows. As the arrow
            assault proved ineffective, the dwarves began to show themselves.
            They were heavily armed with axes, hammers, and swords, glaring at
            the group with clear hostility and intent to kill.
          </p>
          <p>
            In truth, dwarves are not inherently aggressive. However, the
            dwarves here were in a situation where they had been living hidden
            from human eyes, and once discovered, they could not afford to let
            these intruders live. Moreover, what Repenhardt and his group had
            destroyed was the temple of the dwarves’ god, Al Fort. Naturally,
            the dwarves were not inclined to look kindly on those who had
            demolished their sacred site.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt and Sillan exchanged bitter smiles as they looked at each
            other.
          </p>
          <p>“Tsk, everyone’s gaze is no joke, huh?”</p>
          <p>
            “Indeed. It’s like the look a father gives when he finds a stranger
            breaking into his daughter’s bedroom window in the middle of the
            night.”
          </p>
          <p>“…That’s an oddly plausible analogy.”</p>
          <p>
            Russ’s complexion hardened as he gripped his sword. He glared down
            at the dwarves and bellowed,
          </p>
          <p>“How dare you lowly creatures attempt to harm a human!”</p>
          <p>
            The expressions of the dwarves grew even colder, clearly angered by
            Russ’s arrogant words. Russ snorted and gathered his strength.
          </p>
          <p>Hummmm!</p>
          <p>
            A blue blade aura blazed incandescently around him as a murderous
            intent rose above Russ’s shoulders. Repenhardt, serious, shouted at
            him,
          </p>
          <p>“Russ! Withdraw your killing intent!”</p>
          <p>“Eh? But brother…”</p>
          <p>
            Confused, Russ stepped back, and Repenhardt walked forward. His
            figure fully exposed, the dwarves were startled and pulled their
            bowstrings. About ten arrows flew towards him. However, Repenhardt
            made no move to block the attack. Instead, to clearly show his lack
            of hostility, he even raised his hands above his head.
          </p>

          <p>Ting-ting-ting-ting!</p>
          <p>
            The arrows bounced off harmlessly. Without using any aura or
            anything, Repenhardt’s trained body was unscathed by mere ordinary
            arrows. The dwarves gasped and murmured among themselves.
          </p>
          <p>“He’s a monster!”</p>
          <p>“The arrows don’t work on him!”</p>
          <p>
            “And he’s blatantly showing off that our arrows can’t touch him,
            mocking us!”
          </p>
          <p>“No, that’s not it…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue inwardly. Raising his hands in
            surrender had only intensified the murderous look on the dwarves’
            faces. Knowing he couldn’t delay any longer without escalating the
            situation, he quickly spoke up.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sons of the Earth who can hear the voice of truth! Hear me out! We
            are not your enemies!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The killing intent in the dwarves visibly subsided. They exchanged
            confused looks. The head of the dwarves, a burly middle-aged dwarf,
            cautiously spoke up.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you saying you, a human, are not our enemy?”</p>
          <p>Still with his hands raised, Repenhardt responded,</p>
          <p>“Yes, indeed!”</p>
          <p>
            It was certain. The intruder before them was speaking the truth. The
            middle-aged dwarf, with an expression of disbelief, then asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Then who are you? Why have you come here?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s expression hardened for a moment. Who am I? Why am I
            here? Of course, he had an answer, but that answer was…
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, it’s too embarrassing to say out loud…”</p>
          <p>
            Still, to avoid shedding blood here, he had no choice but to
            proclaim it. Gathering his courage, Repenhardt declared again,
          </p>
          <p>“I am your savior! The one foretold in the Oracle of Al Fort!”</p>
          <p>
            The dwarves’ expressions changed drastically. There was no more
            malice. Their eyes widened as they stared at Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            And his companions’ eyes were just as wide, though for entirely
            different reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, Mr. Repen, my face is burning up. What kind of line is that?”
          </p>
          <p>“Sh-shut up! Do you think I enjoy saying such things?”</p>
          <p>
            Having uttered the line, Repenhardt’s face turned crimson with
            embarrassment as he desperately avoided their gazes. Then, he called
            out to the dwarves once again,
          </p>
          <p>
            “I have come to meet the High Priest Makelin, guided by the
            Steelhammer clan to this Grand Forge!”
          </p>
          <p>Russ, who had been tense in the background, clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>“No, brother. Even so, there’s no way they’ll believe us…”</p>

          <p>
            Before he could finish, the dwarves sheathed their weapons. They all
            cheerfully exclaimed,
          </p>
          <p>“Oh! It’s the savior!”</p>
          <p>“The savior of our clan has come!”</p>
          <p>“Welcome!”</p>
          <p>“Nice to meet you!”</p>
          <p>“But why appear here instead of the proper main gate?”</p>
          <p>
            With the earlier malice gone, they all crowded around the group with
            faces full of welcoming smiles. Sillan murmured with a dazed
            expression,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wow, how can their attitude change so quickly like flipping a
            palm?”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The Grand Forge was an underground city located 30 meters beneath
            the Setelrad mountain range. Within a vast cavern, spanning a
            diameter of 2 kilometers and a height ranging from 30 meters at the
            lowest to 50 meters at the highest, numerous buildings were densely
            packed. Instead of river water, boiling hot springs flowed through
            the two rivers that cut through the city, emitting clouds of steam
            everywhere. The ceiling of the city was studded with giant
            geothermal stones every 100 meters, providing light and heat.
            Although it wasn’t as bright as the midday sun above ground, it was
            bright enough to distinguish objects without any difficulty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Led by a middle-aged dwarf, Repenhardt’s group walked along the main
            road at the center of Grand Forge. It was the same dwarf who had
            first shouted to shoot arrows at them. Introducing himself as
            Fulbar, he pointed out various places around Grand Forge like a tour
            guide.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This area is the smithing district, where all the master smiths
            gather. If we walk a bit further, we’ll reach the residential
            district where the homes are clustered.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked around as if they were country bumpkins just arrived
            in the city. Sillan let out a whistle.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow, how did they manage to build all this?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris also appeared to agree, surprised at the skill of the dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I knew dwarves were skilled craftsmen, but I never imagined it to
            this extent.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Even Tilla, a dwarf herself, was gaping. Indeed, she fit the
            description of a ‘country bumpkin’ the most among them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve heard many stories but… the Grand Forge really is incredible…”
          </p>
          <p>
            A newfound sense of pride in her clan swelled in her heart. While
            most elves and orcs had forgotten all their culture and traditions,
            the dwarves still maintained this level of civilization. Russ looked
            on in disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s incomprehensible. Even for dwarves, such a grand endeavor
            would require a tremendous number of people…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ couldn’t grasp how such a significant population could live in
            such a harsh wilderness. Remote areas are called so because they are
            difficult to live in. It seemed unlikely that dwarves capable of
            such large-scale construction could properly sustain life deep
            within the Setelrad Mountain Range.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And if they have this scale of resources, why don’t they try to
            free their kin who live as slaves?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, Russ, are you starting to find it strange that dwarves live as
            slaves?”
          </p>
          <p>“What are you talking about, Sillan?”</p>
          <p>“Well, you wouldn’t ask such a question otherwise.”</p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Russ groaned at Sillan’s teasing comment. Even someone as set in his
            ways as Russ couldn’t help but have his paradigm shaken by such an
            incredible sight.
          </p>
          <p>At the two’s conversation, Fulbar gave a bitter smile and said,</p>
          <p>“In truth, we did not build this Grand Forge.”</p>
          <p>
            Originally, the Grand Forge was a relic of the Silver Age, a
            dungeon. It was repurposed by dwarves who had been driven to this
            location. After many sacrifices, continuous exploration, and
            modifications, they made it their dwelling place.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, across the continent, there are many relics that have been
            fully explored and subsequently abandoned. Most disappear into other
            dimensions after losing their magical cores, but some, like this
            one, remain in reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Usually, humans demolish or repurpose such places into buildings for
            other uses, with the palace of the Graim Kingdom, Del Graim, being a
            prime example. Originally a dungeon, it was fully explored 400 years
            ago by the first king of the Graim Kingdom, Del Graim. He modified
            the underground and built a palace above it, turning it into the
            royal castle.
