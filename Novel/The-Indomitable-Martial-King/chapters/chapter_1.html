    Chapter 1<br />
    [ Chapter 1: Prologue ]
  </p>
  <p>In the heart of the Great Demon Palace Gairak, the Hall of the Abyss.</p>
  <p>
    Within this vast hall, boasting the greatest grandeur on earth, a group of
    men and women had gathered.
  </p>
  <p>
    They were powerful figures from across the continent, transcending gender
    and age.
  </p>
  <p>
    There was the muscular middle-aged man with a body of steel that never
    breaks, Teslon, the Martial King.
  </p>
  <p>
    The continent’s strongest swordsman, Cyrus the Sword Star, who could split
    even souls with a single slash of his sword.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ellin, the Holy Maiden of the Supreme God Seiya, possessor of infinite
    divine power.
  </p>
  <p>Jade Arclight, the great Light Mage blessed with mana.</p>
  <p>
    And standing before them, the blond-haired, pale-eyed young man, Prince Alex
    von Hallain of the Kingdom of Hallain, known as a hero to the world for his
    mastery of the sword, magic, and divine power.
  </p>
  <p>
    Their gaze was collectively fixed on the opposite staircase. Dressed in a
    blood-red robe, a middle-aged man with an arrogant demeanor looked down on
    them indifferently. Alex shouted at him,
  </p>
  <p>“Your evil deeds end now, Demon King Repenhardt!”</p>
  <p>Demon King Repenhardt.</p>
  <p>
    The Emperor of the Dark Empire Antares and the most powerful and evil
    sorcerer in human history.
  </p>
  <p>
    A true demon god incarnate, who led a million soldiers of darkness, wielded
    powerful dark magic to burn half the continent, and massacred millions.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the sake of defeating this evil Demon King, tens of thousands of
    soldiers sacrificed their lives, cutting through the dark forces. They bled
    rivers and threw their lives away like dogs, never sparing a thought for
    their own survival.
  </p>
  <p>
    On the foundation of these heroic sacrifices, the chosen champions of
    humanity successfully infiltrated the Great Demon Palace of Gairak and,
    after a fierce battle, finally stood before the Demon King.
  </p>
  <p>
    The chosen hero, Alex von Hallain, tried to calm his overflowing heart as he
    continued,
  </p>

  <p>“The time has come for you to return to the darkness! Evil Demon King!”</p>
  <p>
    In truth, Demon King Repenhardt wasn’t looking indifferent. It’s just that
    his naturally cold demeanor made it hard to tell, but he was actually
    looking down at Alex and his party with a great sense of emptiness.
  </p>
  <p>
    Sword Star Cyrus, wielding his long sword Illuminator that shimmered with a
    blue light, shouted,
  </p>
  <p>
    “Demon King Repenhardt, we will destroy you and put an end to the history of
    this Dark Empire!”
  </p>
  <p>
    It was unjust. He had worked hard to establish his empire. After three days
    of deep contemplation, he had even given it the magnificent name of Antares,
    after a throne’s title. So why ignore a perfectly good name and only call it
    the Dark Empire? It was an ordinary place where the sun rose in the morning
    and the moon at night.
  </p>
  <p>
    The muscular middle-aged brute praised as the Martial King continued his
    companion’s speech.
  </p>
  <p>
    “If you disappear, the demonic nature of those corrupted monsters will
    vanish as well!”
  </p>
  <p>
    Vanish my foot. They were always like that. What, did ogres, gnolls, and
    goblins live peacefully and then get corrupted because of Repenhardt? They
    just didn’t gather in numbers before to dare attack humans. All he did was
    take them in and teach them ‘tactics used by humans.’
  </p>
  <p>
    Those who would normally flee at the sight of humans or, if they attacked,
    could be easily killed, suddenly started using group tactics like an army.
    And now everyone’s making a fuss, claiming they’ve been corrupted or soaked
    in demonic energy, but in truth, it’s all just human behavior being
    mirrored.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt opened his mouth with a tired voice—of course, Alex and his
    companions thought of it as the dark and evil tone befitting of a Demon
    King.
  </p>
  <p>“…Have all my Four Heavenly Kings fallen?”</p>
  <p>
    The strong individuals from the four races who followed Repenhardt. Those
    precious subordinates who had been loyal and had trusted him for a long
    time. He worried about their well-being.
  </p>
  <p>Sword Saint Cyrus proudly held up his sword and replied.</p>
  <p>“Yes. That filthy orc was no match for my sword.”</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt sighed, remembering Tassid, the brave orc warrior with high
    martial pride.
  </p>
  <p>
    The orcs, living in tribes, hunting, and gathering, might seem barbaric and
    simple, but they were pure beings who knew nothing of betrayal. They took
    pride in fighting against the harsh nature of the world, protecting the
    weak, and standing against the strong. Why should this warrior race be
    treated as monsters? Well, they hardly ever bathed, so being called filthy
    wasn’t exactly wrong.
  </p>
  <p>Martial King Teslon clenched his fist and joined in.</p>
  <p>“That hideous monster troll paid the price for his sins.”</p>
  <p>
    It seems that the wise and knowledgeable Grand Sorcerer, Guru Attila, has
    also returned to the earth’s embrace.
  </p>

  <p>
    Honestly, trolls do look a bit scary. With their bulging blue skin and
    protruding tusk-like teeth, even Repenhardt would get startled if he bumped
    into Attila on a dark night, so it’s understandable.
  </p>
  <p>
    But to call them hideous monsters is outrageous. Trolls live deep in the
    mountains under a shamanistic faith. Living with the bare minimum given by
    nature, refining their souls instead of owning material things, they might
    seem primitive but possessed an advanced spiritual culture. There was no
    reason for them to be called monsters.
  </p>
  <p>Saint Ellin quietly opened her mouth.</p>
  <p>
    “The evil dwarf who once served the Dark God has also returned to the
    rightful flow.”
  </p>
  <p>
    The High Priest of Al-Fort, Makelin, seems to have died as well. Repenhardt
    clicked his tongue. He couldn’t recall when the dwarves’ racial deity,
    Al-Fort, became an evil Dark God. Such arrogance to consider all but the
    main god Seiya, who protects humans, and the twelve gods as evil beings!
  </p>
  <p>The Mage of Light, Jade, faintly smiled and said,</p>
  <p>“That corrupted dark elf fought with me.”</p>
  <p>
    A corrupted dark elf… Yes, her skin is indeed somewhat dusky. Driven out and
    hunted because humans plundered and cut down the forests where her people
    lived, she eventually made her way to live in the barren wastelands, getting
    significantly tanned by the wilderness’s blazing sun. Is a pure-blooded High
    Elf considered a Dark Elf just because she got a bit of a tan?
  </p>
  <p>“And she couldn’t match up to my magic. Huhuhu.”</p>
  <p>
    Upon hearing Jade’s voice that followed, Repenhardt finally closed his eyes.
  </p>
  <p>Ah, Siris…</p>
  <p>Even you, in the end…</p>
  <p>* * *</p>
  <p>
    Originally, Repenhardt was an ordinary archmage. Well, one cannot really
    call someone an archmage and ordinary at the same time, but still, he wasn’t
    the kind of being who wielded the tremendous, beyond-common-sense magic he
    does now.
  </p>
  <p>
    He changed when he sought a new realm of magic, turning his eyes towards the
    cultures of non-human races.
  </p>
  <p>How long had it been since the supreme god, Seiya, created humanity?</p>
  <p>The world was already dominated by humans.</p>
  <p>
    The various races that once contended for supremacy over the continent, like
    elves, trolls, dwarves, and orcs, had all lost their power and declined
    significantly. Humanity had subsumed all these races under their system, and
    the outcome was harsh.
  </p>
  <p>Humans did not regard these races as beings of equal intelligence.</p>

  <p>
    Elves, known as the fairies of the forest, were popular as pretty and
    long-living servants.
  </p>
  <p>
    The dwarves, the robust sons of the earth, were valuable as slaves for their
    skill in digging and craftsmanship.
  </p>
  <p>
    The orcs, a race of proud warriors, were ideal as strong and simple-minded
    laborers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Trolls, with their astonishing regenerative abilities, were not even
    considered for slavery. They were caught and sliced up to be used as
    ingredients for healing potions.
  </p>
  <p>
    How astonished must Repenhardt have been to realize that great secrets were
    hidden within the forgotten cultures of these enslaved races, all of whom
    had lost their pride and dignity?
  </p>
  <p>
    He soon followed the ancient traces of these races. Fortunately, not all
    non-human races had become slaves to humanity. There were a few, gathered in
    unexplored regions untouched by humans, who were desperately preserving
    their cultures.
  </p>
  <p>
    Meeting them, learning their cultures, and combining elf spirit magic and
    troll shamanism with his own, Repenhardt was able to innovate a new realm of
    magic. He became the first magician in history to wield 10th circle magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    As he continued to interact with these races, Repenhardt’s values naturally
    changed. No longer were these beings mere slaves to him. Consequently, he
    could not stand by and watch the atrocious realities rampant in human
    society.
  </p>
  <p>
    So, he seized every opportunity to rescue the enslaved non-humans,
    diligently arranging ways for them to live.
  </p>
  <p>
    Over time, the villages of the hidden non-humans grew to a size that could
    no longer deceive human eyes. The humans’ kings and nobles immediately
    coveted them when the once enslaved dared to build their own villages. They
    brandished their swords and spears, leading their knights to invade.
  </p>
  <p>
    Having been attacked, a counterattack was natural. Repenhardt’s powerful
    magic, now beyond common sense, could obliterate armies and walls alike. The
    invaders were completely wiped out. He felt no guilt; it was a case of
    self-defense. There was no reason to sympathize with them.
  </p>
  <p>
    After eliminating the enemies, the lands they had died possessing became
    vacant. Thus, I expanded the village and moved various other races to live
    there as well.
  </p>
  <p>
    Continually they invaded, continually we crushed them, continually lands
    were emptied, and continually we relocated.
  </p>
  <p>
    In time, what was once a village began to resemble a nation. As Repenhardt’s
    fame spread across the continent, even other orc, troll, elf, and dwarf
    tribes hidden in the far reaches requested to live under his protection.
    Repenhardt, of course, did not refuse. He welcomed all who came.
  </p>
  <p>Thus, four years passed.</p>
  <p>
    The Kingdom of Vasily, the Teikan Kingdom, the Lastil Duchy. These three
    nations fell, and in their place, the Antares Empire was born.
  </p>
  <p>
    Although Repenhardt found himself founding a nation of diverse races, it
    wasn’t out of hatred for humans. He simply believed in equality for all
    sentient beings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore, he did not implement retaliatory policies, such as enslaving
    humans. Instead, he treated them as equals among the other races.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, people did not see it this way. They believed Repenhardt harbored
    hatred towards humans, gathering dark forces to annihilate mankind and
    conquer the world. In reality, the citizens of the Antares Empire felt their
    lives had improved. Yet, there were claims that Repenhardt had deceived the
    populace with wicked magic.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the establishment of the empire, full-scale invasions by other nations
    ensued. Initially, it was one nation; then two allied against him;
    eventually, a coalition of three countries attacked.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each time, Repenhardt repelled the invaders with powerful magic. As the
    human forces grew, so did the challenge of opposing them. Thus, he reached
    out to intellectually lesser races like ogres, gnolls, and goblins, deemed
    monsters by humans, and incorporated them into his forces. Despite their
    brutal and uncontrollable nature, Repenhardt succeeded in making them part
    of his army through extensive mind control magic and ample food.
  </p>
  <p>The military might of the diverse races grew day by day.</p>
  <p>The scale of war escalated.</p>
  <p>
    And before he knew it, he was dubbed a Demon King, becoming a subject of
    fear and hatred among all humans on the continent.

  <p>[ Chapter 2 ]</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt opened his eyes. Five pairs of eyes, filled with a light that was
    unwavering despite the evident tension, stared back at him with intensity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Truly, those were eyes of steadfast belief. To others, they might seem like
    eyes full of noble convictions. However, to Repenhardt, they appeared as the
    gaze of those too caught in their own righteousness, embodying a dangerous
    mix of self-righteousness and obstinacy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The blonde youth, Alex von Hallein, drew his sword. Pointing the royal
    blade, adorned with lavish decorations, he declared,
  </p>
  <p>
    “I shall soothe the souls of those who died by your hand with this sword!”
  </p>
  <p>Repenhardt, with a somber tone, retorted,</p>
  <p>“…And who shall soothe the souls of the elves and orcs who have died?”</p>
  <p>Taken aback, Alex shouted in indignation,</p>
  <p>
    “Detestable Repenhardt! Were it not for your vile powers, they would not
    have fallen to corruption! They could have lived peacefully, fulfilling
    their true roles! Was it not you who killed them?”
  </p>
  <p>It was futile. There was no room for dialogue.</p>
  <p>
    In their eyes, he was nothing but an evil Demon King. To them, any race that
    dared to step out of the servitude was merely a dark race, tainted and
    corrupted by demonic influence.
  </p>
  <p>A light of anger flashed across Repenhardt’s dark eyes.</p>
  <p>“In that case…”</p>
  <p>Gradually, a purple aura began to rise from his blood-red robe.</p>
  <p>“I shall become the Demon King you so desire!”</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt gathered all his magical power. A terrifying momentum swirled
    around him, as a pillar of purple magic shot up into the sky.
  </p>
  <p>
    Simultaneously, Alex and his companions assumed battle stances. A blue and
    golden aura emanated from the martial king and the sword sage, respectively.
    Jade also summoned his magic, and Ellin enveloped the group with a holy
    aura.
  </p>
  <p>Alex charged at the Demon King, sword in hand, crying out,</p>
  <p>“Taaaah!”</p>
  <p>
    Thus, the battle that would decide the fate of the continent began. Powerful
    magic shattered the surroundings, as blue sword light and golden martial
    energy stormed through like a tempest. The aftermath alone was enough to
    send the hall’s ceiling flying and crumble the solid granite walls into
    sand. The marble floor cracked as if struck by an earthquake, and flames
    sparked by magical aftershocks spread intense heat.
  </p>
  <p>
    About half an hour later, Alex, despite being a hero, was the first to fall,
    vomiting blood. Though it might seem somewhat ridiculous that he was the
    first to be defeated, upon closer examination, it wasn’t so strange at all.
  </p>
  <p>
    People marveled at Alex, who was proficient in swordsmanship, magic, and
    even possessed divine power, bestowing upon him the title of “hero.”
    However, this title wasn’t entirely meant in a positive light. In essence,
    it suggested ambiguity in his specialization, as if to say, “He seems
    strong, but what exactly is his main field?” Positively speaking, he was a
    jack of all trades; more bluntly, a master of none. While in heroic tales
    the hero remains to sever the last breath of the Demon King, reality favors
    those who excel in a specific field.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even when Alex was down, the others continued to fight. True to the saying,
    Repenhardt found it challenging to easily defeat those who “dig one well
    deeply”. The battle prolonged, stretching into the night as the moon rose.
    Each individual, excelling in their respective fields, launched relentless
    attacks against Repenhardt.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yet, Repenhardt stood unyielding. Protected by his infinite magical power,
    he calmly parried all attacks, dealing deadly blows in return. Eventually,
    the saint Ellin fell, the light magician Jade was knocked unconscious, and
    even the sword of the sword saint Cyrus broke, leaving only two standing in
    the hall.
  </p>
  <p>
    Teslon, the Fist King, with his unparalleled physical strength and stamina,
    persisted alone in the battle against Repenhardt.
  </p>
  <p>
    His body was formidable, and his will, terrifying. Dodging, evading, and
    sometimes absorbing ultimate magics with his body, bleeding and injured, he
    never kneeled.
  </p>
  <p>
    As dawn approached, Repenhardt’s seemingly infinite magical power finally
    waned.
  </p>
  <p>
    This marked the turning point in the fate of the continent. Deprived of
    mana, Repenhardt was no different from an ordinary person, while Teslon,
    though on the verge of death, still had the strength for one last blow.
  </p>
  <p>“Cough, cough…”</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt coughed, expelling bloody clots mixed with sharp pains as if his
    lungs were being stabbed.
  </p>
  <p>
    He was dying. A single punch from Teslon was enough to halt most of his
    bodily functions. Although he was delaying death with his magic, it was
    clear he wouldn’t last long.
  </p>
  <p>
    Leaning against the collapsed wall, gasping for breath, Repenhardt gazed at
    the dawn sky with a look full of regret. His vision was blurring.
  </p>
  <p>‘Is this… death?’</p>
  <p>
    Regret washed over him. Not for aiding the other races – he held no regrets
    for assisting the beautiful elves, the reliable dwarves, the brave orcs, and
    the wise trolls.
  </p>
  <p>His regret was his own folly.</p>
  <p>
    He had always responded to everything too passively. Even as invasions came
    one after the other, he only retaliated without ever decisively invading
    another country. Because of this, he gave other nations the leisure to rearm
    for another invasion. He even provided the opportunity for the alarmed
    nations to join forces against him. Until the entire continent conspired
    against him, Repenhardt held on to the optimistic belief that, with time,
    they would all come to understand.
  </p>
  <p>This was the cost of such beliefs.</p>
  <p>
    If he had intended to help, he should have done so properly. He should have
    anticipated the backlash from humans and that the entire continent would
    become hostile. Instead of accidentally founding a nation, he should have
    firmly planned and established a strong state to protect the diverse races
    from the start.
  </p>
  <p>If called a Demon King, he should have acted the part!</p>
  <p>“What’s the use in regretting now, though…”</p>
  <p>
    With a blurry smile, Repenhardt’s eyes caught Teslon rising up, leaning
    against a pillar. He, too, was covered in wounds and blood. But he was
    alive, not dying like himself.
  </p>
  <p>
    Wiping his blood-soaked lips, Teslon solemnly said, “This is our victory,
    Demon King Repenhardt.”
  </p>
  <p>Yes, they had won. How wonderful. To win.</p>
  <p>
    With no energy left to scoff, Repenhardt closed his eyes. He just wanted to
    find peace.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then Teslon continued, “…Now, the others will also be freed from the Demon
    Castle and return to their original forms.”
  </p>
  <p>“Ugh!”</p>
  <p>
    He had been ready to give up everything, but those words made it impossible
    to do so. The Demon Castle? Their original forms? Was being slaves their
    original form?
  </p>

  <p>
    Repenhardt gritted his teeth. A mysterious fervor began to flare in his eyes
    that had resigned to fate.
  </p>
  <p>His mind changed.</p>
  <p>He couldn’t die.</p>
  <p>It was too unfair, too infuriating. He couldn’t die like this!</p>
  <p>
    With the last of his strength, Repenhardt pulled out a small gem from his
    bosom.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was an artifact containing powerful magic, found in an ancient ruin, so
    potent that even he, who had pioneered the 10th circle, couldn’t fully
    decipher it.
  </p>
  <p>
    A spell for temporal regression. A magic that twists space-time to send the
    caster back in time, a magic that shakes the very foundation of the world,
    not even permitted by the gods.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since it was a spell that transcended even the concept of circles, there was
    no assurance it would activate correctly. Should it fail, space-time could
    twist, potentially eradicating the entire continent. That’s why, even on the
    brink of death, he dared not use it. But…
  </p>
  <p>“There’s nothing to lose now…”</p>
  <p>Grinding his teeth, Repenhardt slowly chanted the spell.</p>
  <p>
    “La Pert Dem Isted Sapia…… I shall twist the lawful decree and deceive the
    eyes of fate……”
  </p>
  <p>
    Teslon’s expression twisted. It seemed he had not expected Repenhardt to
    resort to such measures even in this dire situation.
  </p>
  <p>“…… Against the flow, I shall remain under the law of defiance……”</p>
  <p>“Impossible, you fool!”</p>
  <p>
    In desperation, Teslon kicked off the ground and launched himself forward.
    Repenhardt panicked at the sight of the foolish fist rushing towards him. If
    that catapult-like fist were to merely graze him, it would be the end of
    him.
  </p>
  <p>Repenhardt hurriedly finished the spell.</p>
  <p>“…… I shall become the one who traverses time and space!”</p>
  <p>
    Dazzling light burst forth from a jewel. Simultaneously, Teslon’s fist broke
    through the light and tore apart Repenhardt’s magical barrier.
  </p>
  <p>“Aaargh!”</p>
  <p>
    A powerful mix of magical energy and golden aura created a massive ripple.
    The magic, which should have flowed orderly, exploded chaotically due to the
    aura’s interference, running rampant. Engulfed in magic, slowly losing
    consciousness, Repenhardt repeated to himself.
  </p>
  <p>I can’t die.</p>
  <p>I absolutely can’t die like this!</p>
  <p>
    His submerged consciousness slowly surfaced. His severed senses awakened.
    Repenhardt opened his eyes. His vision cleared, and he could faintly make
    out the outlines of objects.
  </p>

  <p>
    The distant chirping of birds tickled his ears. The warm morning sun
    caressed his face. The feel of the soft fabric wrapping his body was vivid.
    This sound, this warmth, this comfort……
  </p>
  <p>“Am I still alive?”</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt blinked. Something felt odd. It was as if he had just woken up
    from a deep sleep, an ordinary feeling. But soon, his mind cleared, and
    everything became apparent. He was on the verge of dying to the hands of
    Teslon, the Fist King. It was impossible for his body to be overflowing with
    vitality like this.
  </p>
  <p>It was clear. He was alive.</p>
  <p>“Good heavens, did it really work?”</p>
  <p>
    The time regression spell was barely half-understood. It was truly a gamble,
    but Repenhardt hadn’t really expected it to work. Yet, judging by the
    situation, it seemed to have succeeded spectacularly!
  </p>
  <p>
    “Wow, I knew I was a genius, but I never really thought it would work……”
  </p>
  <p>
    With a line that was ambiguously arrogant or humble, Repenhardt got up. He
    looked around to determine how far back into the past he had traveled. But……
  </p>
  <p>“Where exactly am I?”</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt’s expression hardened again as he surveyed his surroundings.
    Everything seemed excessively unfamiliar.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the spacious room built of logs, the only furnishings were a single
    wardrobe, a desk, and the large bed where Repenhardt had been lying. At
    first glance, it might have seemed like a modest bedroom, but what was
    peculiar was that while the room itself was of cheap construction, every
    piece of furniture within was of high quality. Both the wardrobe and the
    desk were luxurious items befitting nobility, and the bed was a lavish
    piece, sturdily assembled from maple and covered with fine linen, even
    adorned with elegant gold leaf. Hanging on one wall was a glass mirror so
    expensive that only nobles would typically own one.
  </p>
  <p>“What’s this?”</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt was bewildered. No matter how much he thought about it, he did
    not recall ever being in such a place. If his time regression spell had been
    successful, he should have returned to some point in his past, whether his
    childhood or his younger years. Regardless, the place should have been
    familiar to him.
  </p>
  <p>
    Undoubtedly, he had no memory of living in a space with such an unbalanced
    interior.
  </p>
  <p>“Ugh…”</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt rubbed his forehead. His mind was in turmoil. Amidst the
    confusion, he got up and walked toward the mirror. It seemed the spell had
    worked, after all… The question now was just how many years he had regressed
    into the past, and how old he was at this moment.
  </p>
  <p>And the moment he stood in front of the mirror.</p>
  <p>“Gah!”</p>
  <p>Repenhardt’s mouth fell open in shock.</p>
  <p>“What, what is that?”</p>
  <p>
    Reflected in the mirror was a sturdy boy with short brown hair, shirtless,
    looking back at him. Perhaps sixteen or so? While his face was youthful
    enough to call him a boy, his physique was such that even a grown man might
    envy. He was head and shoulders taller than most, his entire body covered in
    firm muscles. His hands were rough with calluses, his arms muscular. His
    biceps and triceps were so solid they seemed as if they would spark fire
    upon clashing, and his abs were so distinctly defined it was hard to believe
    they belonged to a human. It seemed as if carving such distinct six-pack abs
    out of marble would be deemed unrealistic. Despite his muscular build, his
    overall figure was balanced and did not appear overweight, the epitome of an
    ideal warrior’s physique.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, to Repenhardt, who aspired to be the ideal mage, this merely
    appeared as an overly simple and brutish physique.
  </p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt unconsciously raised his hand to his cheek. The boy in the mirror
    did the same.
  </p>
  <p>“Ha… Haha…”</p>
  <p>
    Repenhardt let out a nervous laugh, mirrored by the boy in the reflection.
  </p>
  <p>There was no denying it. He had to accept it.</p>
  <p>This muscular boy was himself!</p>
  <p>Stunned, Repenhardt murmured to himself in disbelief.</p>
  <p>“Who are you… you…?”</p>

    <p>[ Chapter 3 ]</p>
    <p>
      Repenhardt continually touched his face in front of the mirror, a look of
      bewilderment on his face. The mirror reflected a boy with a naive
      expression and muscular build mimicking his every move. A sigh escaped him
      involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>“What on earth happened…”</p>
    <p>
      In his youth, he had black hair and black eyes, bearing a cold demeanor.
      He was also a pretty boy, growing into a man of distinguished charm in his
      older years, his romantic gray hair enchanting numerous elven beauties.
      Never had he ever possessed such a foolish face, not in his youth nor in
      his elder years!
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, upon closer inspection, the boy in the mirror wasn’t exactly ugly.
      He was not the handsome type but rather ruggedly attractive. However, to
      Repenhardt, who had always been praised for his beauty, the reflection
      seemed no better than a common laborer.
    </p>
    <p>Tugging at his hair, Repenhardt was deep in thought.</p>
    <p>
      What in the world happened? Could the time regression spell have failed?
      Had he entered the body of some random person instead of his younger self?
      Or perhaps, this wasn’t the past at all; could his soul have been
      transferred to someone in the future?
    </p>
    <p>
      No matter how much he pondered, without any clues, he could not find an
      answer. As he was agonizing over this, his eyes suddenly took on a
      peculiar shade.
    </p>
    <p>“Now that I think about it, this face does seem somewhat familiar…”</p>
    <p>
      It was odd. The face seemed familiar, yet unfamiliar at the same time,
      with certain features feeling strangely recognizable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those deep brown eyebrows, the determined look in his eyes, the stubbornly
      closed mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, if that body grew larger, the muscles more defined, and if a
      wire-like beard covered the chin…
    </p>
    <p>“Fist King, Teslon?”</p>
    <p>
      It was then. The door swung open, and a majestic voice solidly backed his
      reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Teslon, you rascal! The sun is high in the sky! What are you doing, not
      coming out!”
    </p>

    <p>The moment he turned his head, Repenhardt froze on the spot.</p>
    <p>“Gasp!”</p>
    <p>
      The one who shouted was an old man he had never seen before in his life.
      Standing at 2.5 meters tall, with muscles that seemed about to burst
      covering his entire body, it was hard to distinguish whether this monster
      was a person or a statue painted in flesh color, if one could even call
      this creature an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man strode towards him. Repenhardt was horrified by the muscle
      cloud looming over him. Although he had handled giant monsters like ogres
      and minotaurs with relative ease, this old man seemed to be on a different
      level. The monsters, despite their size, had a certain humanity to them
      with their adequate fat and pot-bellies. In contrast, this old man was
      truly all square and muscle, with not an inch of unnecessary fat, sharp
      muscle lines throughout. If those monsters were like porous sandstone,
      this one was like solid granite. Repenhardt’s physique, which seemed so
      robust and strong, appeared scrawny and gaunt in comparison to the old
      man, even young Teslon. This is why comparative evaluation is frightening.
    </p>
    <p>
      With dazzling white hair and a silver beard fluttering, the old man
      laughed heartily.
    </p>
    <p>“Come on, let’s start the day with joy, hahaha!”</p>
    <p>
      Once the terror that dyed the continent in blood, the Demon King
      Repenhardt, turned into a mouse in front of a cat, asked in a trembling
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>“Who, who are you?”</p>
    <p>
      Unbeknownst to him, the identity of the old man was Teslon’s master and
      the greatest martial artist of the continent, the reigning Fist King,
      Gerard Chrome Proteis.
    </p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p>
      Gerard was preparing for another day of training Teslon, just like any
      other day. However, unlike usual, Teslon did not crawl out to the training
      ground. Infuriated, Gerard immediately ran to catch this unruly disciple.
      How could even a second be wasted when time is of the essence?
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon flinging open his disciple’s door and entering, Gerard saw his
      disciple examining his body in front of a mirror. Gerard’s mood instantly
      improved. It was truly delightful to see him inspecting his muscles so
      thoroughly first thing in the morning. The dedication to sculpting a more
      beautiful physique was commendable. Therefore, he cheerfully shouted.
    </p>
    <p>“Let’s start the day off with joy, haha!”</p>
    <p>
      But there was something odd about his disciple’s expression. It wasn’t the
      usual grinding teeth and fierce, fiery eyes.
    </p>
    <p>“Who are you?”</p>

    <p>“Hm? You’re looking at me as if you don’t know me today?”</p>
    <p>Gerard tilted his head. His disciple spoke again.</p>
    <p>“I’m asking because I really don’t know…”</p>
    <p>Gerard nodded as if he understood. Then he spoke kindly.</p>
    <p>
      “Teslon, Teslon. Haven’t you already used the amnesia excuse twice? You
      should know by now that it won’t work. Tsk tsk.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His disciple’s mouth dropped open, seemingly astounded. The expression
      seemed quite vivid this time, as if his acting had improved significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerard clicked his tongue. However, he didn’t want to blame his disciple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fully understood that the training method of their martial school, Gym
      Unbreakable, was harsh. He himself had tried every possible means to run
      away when he was vigorously training under his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      But ultimately, reaching the peak would one feel the effects of this
      training method firsthand, and one would be moved by the master’s profound
      intentions. Until then, it was the master’s responsibility to forcibly
      guide his disciple to a higher state!
    </p>
    <p>
      Gerard immediately reached out and grabbed his disciple by the nape.
      Though his disciple had already grown to surpass the size of an adult man,
      to Gerard, who stood at 2.5 meters (8’2”) tall, he was still a small boy.
      Easily holding the back of his neck with one huge hand, Gerard said
      cheerfully,
    </p>
    <p>“Let’s go to the training ground!”</p>
    <p>* * *</p>
    <p>
      Deep in the mountains, amidst a dense forest of broadleaf trees, lies a
      clearing with two log cabins. This secluded spot is home to the Gym
      Unbreakable, a martial arts sect that has produced the continent’s
      strongest fighters for generations, though it remains largely unknown to
      the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repenhardt found himself dangling in midair, his neck gripped by an
      elderly man, Gerard, as if he were a kitten being carried by its mother.
      Despite his struggles, Gerard’s muscular grip easily subdued all attempts
      at resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a mage, Repenhardt was not one to remain silent, even in such dire
      circumstances. He pleaded with the old man to listen, but his pleas fell
      on deaf ears, Gerard’s indifference as apparent as if it were the most
      natural response in the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upon reaching the clearing, Gerard set Repenhardt down and tied him to a
      large wooden stake in the center of the area without a word. This
      position, reminiscent of how prisoners are executed, filled Repenhardt
      with alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Repenhardt could voice his panic, Gerard gagged him with a simple,
      efficient motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking at the terrified Repenhardt, Gerard smiled warmly and then fetched
      a large bamboo pole. As he prepared himself, Repenhardt’s fear
      intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a swift motion, Gerard struck Repenhardt’s abdomen with the bamboo,
      eliciting an agonized response from Repenhardt, who couldn’t scream due to
      the gag. The pain seemed magnified by his inability to vocalize it,
      leaving him shaking and looking at Gerard with wide, fearful eyes.
    </p>
    <p>‘What on earth is happening!’</p>
    <p>
      He couldn’t grasp the situation at all. And there was no time given to
      understand. Immediately, the whipping continued. The bamboo struck his
      thighs. It hurt to death, as expected. This time, it hit his side. The
      pain was so intense that tears formed. The bamboo from southern Hallein is
      renowned for combining the strength of steel with the elasticity of
      rubber. Gerard began mercilessly beating Repenhardt’s entire body with
      that brutal object.
    </p>
    <p>Puff puff puff!</p>
    <p>“…… Aaaahaaahaaah!”</p>
    <p>
      Gagged, Repenhardt screamed repeatedly. The beating was truly relentless,
      intensely covering every part of the body evenly, thoroughly, and cruelly.
      The pain was so intense that any thoughts of injustice or questions about
      how this situation came to be flew out of his mind.
    </p>
    <p>Siris. It looks like this is it for me……’</p>
    <p>
      For a moment, he saw Siris beckoning him from beyond the blue sky, a
      mirage in full view. But Repenhardt clenched his teeth. The thought of
      dying after barely obtaining a second life felt too empty. Clinging onto a
      sticky attachment to life, he tried hard to clear his fading
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>‘I can’t die! I absolutely can’t die like this!’</p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Gerard was puzzled. The feel of beating his disciple was a bit
      different from usual. Could it be described as a bit more chewy? This
      shouldn’t be happening if he was undergoing his usual physical training
      through mental imagery.
    </p>
    <p>‘Is it really amnesia?’</p>
    <p>
      It wasn’t particularly surprising. The training method of Gym Unbreakable
      was so simple, brutish, and violent that it often led to short-term
      amnesia. Gerard himself had lost his memory a couple of times when he was
      undergoing training.
    </p>
    <p>And, like someone experienced, he knew the solution well.</p>
    <p>‘Beating will eventually cure it.’</p>
    <p>
      The best way to restore memory was to recreate the experience from when
      the memory was lost. Gerard’s hands became even more ferocious.
    </p>
    <p>Thud thud thud thud thud!</p>
    <p>
      The sound of beating under the clear sky resonated loudly. It was a
      soul-stirring, soul-filled sound of drumming. Naturally, since the drum
      was filled with a soul.
    </p>
    <p>‘Save meeeeeee!’</p>

      <p>[ Chapter 4 ]</p>
      <p>
        The Gym Unbreakable is among the most unique martial sects scattered
        across the continent, holding a distinctly unusual philosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, whether one becomes a warrior, a knight, a swordsman, or a
        martial artist, the fundamental framework of their training remains
        unchanged. It involves refining one’s breathing, strengthening the body,
        and mastering various techniques to enhance overall proficiency as a
        martial artist. Although the specific methods may vary greatly, leading
        to the emergence of different schools, the basic approach is generally
        similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the philosophy of the Gym Unbreakable denies these
        fundamentals.
      </p>
      <p>“First, create a perfect body!”</p>
      <p>Gerard shouted relentlessly as he whipped mercilessly.</p>
      <p>
        “The reason humans wield weapons is that they are weak. They wear armor
        because their bodies are frail, and they take up swords, spears, and
        axes in place of claws and teeth they lack. How foolish is that!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Even while being beaten, Repenhardt found this absurd. Why would using
        tools be considered foolish?
      </p>
      <p>Gerard immediately answered.</p>
      <p>
        “It’s an escape! A pathetic escape of those who cannot overcome their
        own frailty! A true martial artist should strive to train and overcome
        their weaknesses!”
      </p>
      <p>
        Repenhardt was dumbfounded, having never encountered such a simplistic
        and brutish way of thinking in his 50 years of living as a magician.
        Fortunately, the gag in his mouth prevented any reaction from being
        noticeable. Gerard continued speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        “So first, one must create an unbreakable, perfect, indomitable body.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Even as his hand never rested from swinging the cudgel, Gerard calmly
        explained the philosophy of the Gym Unbreakable. He reasoned that
        repeating familiar stories might help his disciple recover from amnesia
        more quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike other schools that combine physical training with skill practice,
        the Gym Unbreakable rejects this. Given the short human lifespan and the
        lofty realms of martial arts to be achieved, they argue, how can one
        reach these heights by dabbling in this and that?
      </p>
      <p>
        “Truly, those who focus on digging one well will eventually succeed.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, they prioritize perfecting the body first. With a perfected body,
        skill training becomes easier as the body is at its peak activation,
        allowing for quick skill acquisition and reducing the time needed to
        correct bad habits. This is the core argument of the Gym Unbreakable.
        The first step to creating this perfect body is to turn the body into
        steel.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Humans are like iron. Both iron and humans become stronger and more
        durable the more they are forged.”
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Why are humans compared to iron! There’s a serious flaw in your logic
        from the start, you!’
      </p>
      <p>
        Repenhardt had long forgotten the fact that if his body had not been
        like this from the beginning, he wouldn’t have ended up in such a state.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gerard, upon entering the house, fetched from the storage the item he
        always used. It was a gigantic bathtub made entirely of marble, big
        enough for a fully grown man to submerge himself completely with room to
        spare. Then, he filled the bathtub with water.
      </p>
      <p>
        True to his reputation as the king of strength of his era, his method of
        filling the tub was nothing short of impressive. While ordinary people
        would laboriously carry water in buckets to fill the tub, this muscular
        behemoth had no need for such tedious steps. He simply lifted the entire
        bathtub and dipped it into the pond behind the house, effectively
        filling it in one go. This immense object, made entirely of marble, was
        handled as if it were a mere washbowl by Gerard, who then proceeded to
        pour a drum of some liquid into it and added various herbs.
      </p>
      <p>
        He then returned to Repenhardt. Having watched Gerard’s actions closely,
        Repenhardt asked with a tinge of fear in his voice.
      </p>
      <p>“What, what is that?”</p>
      <p>“What else? If you’ve worked the metal, you need to cool it down.”</p>
      <p>
        With a nonchalant reply, Gerard grabbed Repenhardt by the nape of his
        neck. Once again, he employed the ‘mother cat carrying her kitten’
        method. It seemed that this old man knew no other way to carry people.
        Indeed, a muscular old man carrying a muscular disciple like a princess
        could be considered a horror scene in its own right.
      </p>

      <p>“Now, then…”</p>
      <p>
        Holding his disciple by the nape, Gerard manipulated his aura. Golden
        aura surged and flowed before seeping into the entirety of Repenhardt’s
        battered body.
      </p>
      <p>“Ugh, ugh?”</p>
      <p>
        Repenhardt groaned at an odd sensation, but even amidst the pain, he
        felt his body healing at an astonishing rate. He was familiar with a
        similar effect from previous magic, which allowed him to recognize the
        activation and amplification of his body’s regeneration capabilities.
        Bones realigned, ligaments tightened, and swollen muscles returned to
        their proper places.
      </p>
      <p>
        In simpler terms, Gerard was currently healing and massaging his
        disciple’s entire body with his aura. The Unbreakable Aura, unique to
        the Gym Unbreakable, was renowned across the continent for its
        exceptional ability to manipulate the physical body, possessing such
        healing properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        After tending to Repenhardt’s body for a while with his aura, Gerard
        then stripped his disciple completely and placed a large funnel in his
        mouth. Of course, he still paid no heed to his disciple’s will.
        Repenhardt, having no energy left to resist, compliantly accepted the
        funnel. After all, he had somewhat anticipated this when he saw the
        bathtub being filled.
      </p>
      <p>‘I mean, I could just undress myself, but why go through all this…’</p>
      <p>
        But then again, he was in no condition to even flick a finger after
        being beaten to a pulp, lacking the strength to undress himself. It
        wasn’t as if Gerard had a hobby of undressing his young male disciples
        for fun.
      </p>
      <p>“Alright, then. I’ll see you in an hour.”</p>
      <p>
        Gerrard submerged Repenhardt completely in the bath, then covered it
        with a lid. The lid had a hole big enough to breathe through, so
        Repenhardt, floating in the water, could somehow still breathe. He
        blankly stared into the water around him.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, he hadn’t noticed, but upon closer inspection, the contents
        were no joke.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘My goodness, healing potions, Gerel herb, petals of the Fetals flower…’
      </p>
      <p>
        Healing potions are items that would cost a fistful of silver coins per
        bottle from any reputable Mage’s Guild. To fill a bathtub with them?
        Even if the water was somewhat diluted, considering the amount of
        healing potion used, the cost was astronomical. There was an old story
        about a queen who bathed in milk for skin beauty. If she saw this, she
        could brag about her frugality to the whole world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, the herbs added were also expensive, all known for their
        potent healing properties. Submerging in the water, he could feel his
        wounds healing and his body recovering at an astonishing rate. At the
        same time, he was acutely aware of his own resilience.
      </p>
      <p>‘This training method wasn’t unfounded after all…’</p>
      <p>
        After strengthening every muscle and bone in his body to the brink of
        death, then quickly healing with the power of aura and medicinal water,
        his body regenerated before any serious illness could take hold,
        becoming even more robust.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘After all, if Teslon could survive up to now by doing this, it really
        says something. Truly, even a troll could be beaten to death with this
        kind of strength.’
      </p>
      <p>
        There was indeed a logical aspect to it that warranted acknowledgment.
        Of course, emotionally, it was the last thing he wanted to accept. Why,
        after all, did he need to go through so much to become stronger? Others
        seemed to grow strong quite normally without such extremes.
      </p>
      <p>
        ‘Teslon must have been repeating this kind of training for years, hasn’t
        he?’
      </p>
      <p>
        The depth of Teslon’s strength, to withstand his magic so, became
        instantly clear.
      </p>
      <p>“Sigh…”</p>
      <p>
        A deep sigh flowed beyond his lips. The healing spring water caressed
        his body, gradually easing the pain. Only now did he begin to regain his
        senses and the capacity to grasp the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immersed in the healing waters, Repenhardt quietly sank into his
        thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>‘First of all, it’s clear that this is the past…’</p>
      <p>
        Considering Teslon’s age, it seemed he had traveled back about 30 years.
        He had a hypothesis about why he was reincarnated into Teslon’s body. It
        was at the very moment the time regression spell was activated that
        Teslon’s attack pierced through the magic, causing a surge of magical
        power. It likely resulted from that aftermath.
      </p>
      <p>‘Hold on. Then, what about me in this time period?’</p>
      <p>Repenhardt’s brows furrowed deeply.</p>
      <p>
        Does that mean a younger version of Repenhardt exists in this time
        period? Can two identical souls exist in the same space and time?
        According to the principles of magic, that was impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        But then, traversing time was also supposed to be impossible by the
        standards of magic. The moment Repenhardt traveled back in time, those
        standards became unreliable.
      </p>
      <p>‘Then…’</p>
      <p>
        The brain of a magician, who once sought the pinnacle of magic, began to
        spin rapidly.

        <p>[ Chapter 5 ]</p>
        <p>‘It seems I can posit two hypotheses,’ Repenhardt mused.</p>
        <p>
          The first hypothesis posits the coexistence of Repenhardt’s soul from
          the future within this body and the current young Repenhardt. The
          second hypothesis contemplates…
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Could it be that the soul of Teslon, the Martial King, has entered my
          body now?’
        </p>
        <p>
          Repenhardt pondered. Even for him, a magician at the pinnacle of his
          art, it was impossible to definitively determine which possibility was
          more likely. After all, both were beyond the common understanding of
          magic he had learned.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘The issue then becomes what impact this will have on the present.’
        </p>
        <p>He considered the scenario of having another version of himself.</p>
        <p>
          What would happen when two identical souls came into contact was
          unknown to anyone. The identity of a soul is an immutable law that
          constitutes the world; in the worst case, one of the souls could be
          annihilated. As a magician, Repenhardt was aware that he had to
          consider even the direst possibilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, it would be at least 10 years before the young Repenhardt
          would become an official magician. Reflecting on the past, this period
          was when he should have been engrossed in his studies at the Delphia
          Mage Tower.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘At least for the time being… it seems unlikely that they will affect
          each other.’
        </p>
        <p>
          And in the second case, if Teslon currently possessed Repenhardt’s
          body?
        </p>
        <p>
          If Teslon, too, had regressed to a past life, he would have memories
          of the past and could likely deduce Repenhardt’s situation as well.
          Then, there’s a considerable chance that he would target himself.
        </p>
        <p>‘Hmm, perhaps this is not an immediate problem either?’</p>
        <p>
          Teslon’s strength originated from his body, but now his body was
          occupied by Repenhardt. Even if Teslon remembered the zenith of his
          power, as long as the foundation of his body was the weak young
          Repenhardt, he could not immediately return to being the Martial King.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘It will take at least a few years. Or, seeing the way training is
          going here, it might even be impossible in a lifetime.’
        </p>
        <p>
          The training method of the Gym Unbreakable absolutely requires a
          mentor’s help. It’s not something one can do alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘No, given Teslon’s level, he might still find a way to train on his
          own.’
        </p>
        <p>
          As he continued to think, his head began to ache from the complexity.
          It seemed that, regardless of which hypothesis was correct,
          confirmation was necessary to devise a proper strategy.
        </p>
        <p>‘Anyway… for now… escaping from this hell… is the priority…’</p>
        <p>
          Repenhardt’s thoughts began to fade. Continuing to think left him too
          exhausted. Unwittingly, he fell into a deep sleep.
        </p>
        <p>
          Exactly an hour later, Gerard fetched Repenhardt from the bathhouse.
          Tossing him some dry clothes, he shouted,
        </p>
        <p>“My disciple! Let’s eat!”</p>
        <p>
          Repenhardt, whose body had just recovered and was now ravenously
          hungry, was thrilled and quickly got dressed and ran to Gerard.
          Despite the situation, it felt imperative to get something into his
          stomach, or he wouldn’t be able to stand it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering the room, Repenhardt expected no more surprises, yet he found
          himself astonished again.
        </p>
        <p>‘Meal? This is it?’</p>

        <p>Gerard’s cooking was generous. It was truly a man’s meal.</p>
        <p>
          Simply slicing up an entire pig and throwing it into a pot with
          various vegetables and grains, then boiling it all together was the
          entirety of the dish. Gerard handed over a ladle, saying,
        </p>
        <p>“Here’s your spoon.”</p>
        <p>
          Looking at the merciless mixture of liquid and solids in the pot,
          which was suspiciously stew-like, Repenhardt seriously contemplated
          whether he should eat it.
        </p>
        <p>‘Wait, is this supposed to be a serving for one?’</p>
        <p>
          It wasn’t both Gerard and him eating from this enormous pot. Gerard
          had already set up a separate meal for himself, consisting of bread,
          soup, meat, and vegetables—a normal diet that wouldn’t be too much for
          three or four adult men. Indeed, that amount was substantial but
          reasonable. Given Gerard’s size, no one would question him eating that
          much.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the pot in front of Repenhardt was on another level entirely.
          It seemed enough to feed an entire squad of orcs from the era of the
          Antares Empire, with enough left over to pat their stomachs. Was he
          really expected to eat all this? Would there be consequences for
          leaving leftovers like before?
        </p>
        <p>‘Well, let’s eat anyway…’</p>
        <p>
          Though daunted, Repenhardt began eating without a word. Surprisingly,
          the meal was delicious. This wasn’t to say Gerard had exceptional
          cooking skills. The saying that hunger is the best spice could be
          amplified hundreds of times to describe this situation.
        </p>
        <p>Gerard kindly explained for his amnesiac disciple,</p>
        <p>
          “Your body has been pushed to its limits. It needs that much
          replenishment.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Repenhardt mindlessly devoured the stew. Initially doubting he could
          finish it alone, once he started eating, he couldn’t stop. He found it
          absurd how he kept on eating endlessly.
        </p>
        <p>
          ‘Is this even possible? What about the law of conservation of mass?’
        </p>
        <p>
          Feeling as though the principles of magic were being defied,
          Repenhardt finished off the pot. It was as if he was digesting the
          food as quickly as he was eating it.
        </p>
        <p>Gerard cleared away the cauldron and spoke kindly.</p>
        <p>“Now, let’s run lightly to aid digestion.”</p>
        <p>And so, the afternoon training began.</p>
        <p>
          To Repenhardt, who was a magician, the afternoon training seemed quite
          standard.
        </p>
        <p>
          First, they would run around the mountain for about an hour with heavy
          metal weights attached to their entire body. This was followed by a
          series of physically demanding exercises that were ambiguous in their
          ordinariness: push-ups using only fingers, crunches while holding
          dumbbells in the mouth, and squats while carrying boulders. The
          intensity was brutish, but it was understandable training, so this
          time Repenhardt quietly followed along.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, he felt like he was going to lose consciousness several
          times in the process. However, a single word from Gerard immediately
          reinvigorated him.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Hm? Are you struggling, my disciple? Shall we just continue with the
          morning training?”
        </p>
        <p>“No, Sirrrrrrr!”</p>
        <p>
          Preferring to carry boulders over being beaten to death, Repenhardt’s
          motivation soared to the skies.
        </p>
        <p>* * *</p>
        <p>
          The sun had set, and the exhausting day had finally come to an end.
          After throwing the utterly worn-out Repenhardt into the room, Gerard
          offered a night greeting with a pleased smile on his face.
        </p>

        <p>“Good work today, my disciple. See you tomorrow.”</p>
        <p>“Ah, good night… Master…”</p>
        <p>“Yes, yes…”</p>
        <p>
          Gerard closed the door with a content smile, and Repenhardt stared
          blankly at him. It was a truly comforting expression, filled with love
          for his disciple.
        </p>
        <p>‘Looking at him, he can’t be a bad person…’</p>
        <p>
          But what good does being a nice person do if one’s head is filled with
          vicious ideologies!
        </p>
        <p>‘I’m escaping tonight! I’ll find a way to escape no matter what!’</p>
        <p>
          Repenhardt quietly lay on the bed, waiting only for Gerard’s room
          light to turn off. His body, exhausted to the core, screamed for
          sleep, but he endured it with formidable mental strength. After all,
          he was a mage, a profession that prides itself on unparalleled mental
          fortitude.
        </p>
        <p>
          Gerard’s room light turned off soon after. However, Repenhardt didn’t
          move immediately.
        </p>
        <p>‘I can’t carelessly move before he falls deep asleep.’</p>
        <p>
          After struggling to keep his eyelids open for about an hour,
          Repenhardt finally moved. He tiptoed, carefully opened the window, and
          moved cautiously through the yard until the building was out of sight.
          Since he couldn’t be sure of Gerard’s extraordinary senses, he dared
          not act rashly.
        </p>
        <p>And finally, when he had crossed a hill.</p>
        <p>‘Run!’</p>
        <p>
          Repenhardt dashed towards the foothills. Thanks to his thoroughly
          trained body, he quickly gained speed despite being overworked. He ran
          through the mountain path at a terrifying speed that would make any
          wild beast cry in envy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The irrational training seemed logical, but it meant nothing to him.
          He had no intention of becoming a warrior. His mind was filled with
          the most powerful magics of his era. He needed to become a 10th circle
          ultimate mage once again and rebuild the Antares Empire. Was this the
          time to be building muscles?
        </p>
        <p>
          How long had he run? A light of irrepressible joy appeared on
          Repenhardt’s face as he ran blindly.
        </p>
        <p>‘Ah! Freedom! I’ve finally escaped!’</p>
        <p>Just as a sense of relief was about to overwhelm him—</p>
        <p>“My disciple, where are you going?”</p>
        <p>A large old man was sitting on a rock ahead, smiling broadly.</p>
        <p>“Gah!”</p>
        <p>
          This monstrous old man! When did he get here ahead of time? Gerard
          looked at Repenhardt, who was internally screaming, and chuckled
          merrily.
        </p>
        <p>
          “So you’ve decided to run away after all, not having done so for a
          month or two. Is this the ninth time? One more escape and you’ll hit
          double digits.”
        </p>
        <p>
          It was clear that Gerard wasn’t surprised at all by the escape of his
          disciple. It seemed that Teslon also had a habit of running away
          frequently. Repenhardt’s shoulders slumped.
        </p>
        <p>“Sigh…”</p>

        <p>
          It was clear something had to change. This couldn’t continue. After a
          moment of contemplation, Repenhardt lifted his head.
        </p>
        <p>“Listen here, old man. I have something serious to say.”</p>
        <p>Gerard responded calmly.</p>
        <p>“Let’s hear it.”</p>
        <p>
          “I’m not actually the boy known as Teslon. My name is Repenhardt. I’m
          a wizard.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Repenhardt then seriously began to share his story, explaining how he
          ended up in the body of this boy.
        </p>
        <p>
          It was a story that should never have been revealed. However, having
          already experienced hell, Repenhardt wasn’t thinking that far ahead.
          His only concern was escaping from this place.
        </p>
        <p>
          “…So, that’s what happened. Therefore, I cannot become your
          disciple……”
        </p>
        <p>
          After finishing his story, Repenhardt looked at Gerard and swallowed
          hard. Would the old man believe his story? And if he did, how would he
          react to the existence of an evil wizard who had stolen his disciple’s
          soul?
        </p>
        <p>
          Surprisingly, Teslon didn’t seem shocked at all. He just narrowed his
          eyes and let out a small laugh.
        </p>
        <p>“Oh, is that the story this time?”</p>
        <p>“What?”</p>
        <p>
          “Before, you said you were an otherworlder who came from another
          dimension. That you entered that body after encountering dragons and
          gods.”
        </p>
        <p>“Eh?”</p>
        <p>
          “And before that? Something about being a master from the legendary
          Eastern Continent who was reincarnated here, if I recall correctly?”
        </p>
        <p>
          And with a single step, he moved behind Repenhardt and suddenly
          grabbed his neck, lifting him up. The massive figure of 2.5 meters
          moved without even being seen. Truly, it was a terrifying movement
          worthy of the Fist King of the era.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Still, this time the setting is a bit more detailed. You’ve improved
          a lot. Playing the role of a wandering bard as a hobby might not be a
          bad idea, my disciple.”
        </p>
        <p>
          Suspended in the air, Repenhardt was frustrated. To think that even
          this was futile! Gerard was smirking continuously. It seemed that
          Teslon had been earnestly spewing similar lies for a long time.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Come on, let’s go back and sleep. You need to rest well to endure
          tomorrow’s training!”
        </p>
        <p>
          Repenhardt could not see even a hint of doubt in the old man’s
          expression, carrying his disciple back, that he might not be the real
          Teslon. And, in fact, it was a story of little concern to Gerard. What
          he wanted was a robust body that could endure the training methods of
          the Gym Unbreakable, nothing else mattered, whatever it was!
        </p>
        <p>‘Damn it!’</p>
        <p>
          Realizing this, Repenhardt despaired. There seemed to be no way out of
          this hell. The world was all darkness. It was the middle of the night,
          after all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dangling as he returned to hell, Repenhardt changed his mind. Even
          though it had been just a day’s encounter, he realized it desperately.
          That no words would work on this old man named Gerard. Words achieve
          nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Quietly returning to the log cabin, Repenhardt gritted his teeth and
          resolved, and resolved again.
        </p>
        <p>‘I failed today, but I will definitely escape tomorrow!’</p>
        <p>
          ‘Yes, today’s escape(?) failed. I’ll give you that. But don’t think
          I’ll continue to be trapped here.’
        </p>
        <p>
          Even as he was thrown into bed, Repenhardt did not give up on
          escaping. He was a man who did not know how to give up even in his
          previous life. He didn’t know how to give up to such an extent that he
          was called the Demon King. He couldn’t give up just because of this!
        </p>
        <p>And the next day, yet again, the hellish morning dawned.</p>
        <p>“Aaaaahhhhh!”</p>
        <p>
          Above the clear mountain sky, the boy’s scream sorrowfully echoed yet
          again.

          <p>[ Chapter 6 ]</p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s daily routine was simple.</p>
          <p>
            He would start his day by eating breakfast. On his first day after
            reincarnation, Gerard found Repenhardt’s attitude peculiar and, as a
            form of punishment, made him start training without breakfast.
            However, once Repenhardt began to behave, Gerard took good care of
            his disciple’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, the training method of the Gym Unbreakable included
            meals as an essential part of practice. The cuisine was
            nutritionally perfect, rich in proteins, calories, and various
            nutrients. The only problem was the complete lack of consideration
            for taste.
          </p>
          <p>
            After struggling to distinguish whether his breakfast was rice, pig
            slop, or something regurgitated by a cow, Repenhardt would
            immediately start getting beaten. It was an ordeal of relentless
            beating, followed by lying dead-like in a bath of healing potion and
            herbal cocktail, then voraciously eating lunch. This marked the end
            of the morning training.
          </p>
          <p>
            The afternoon was followed by intense muscle training and then an
            absurd amount of dinner. The evening training routine was the same
            as in the morning: getting beaten to death, taking a bath, and then
            collapsing into sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            Getting beaten to death, eating to death, lifting to death, and
            sleeping like dead.
          </p>
          <p>
            For Repenhardt, who had lived as a magician, these were unimaginably
            tough times. Naturally, he tried to escape at every opportunity. He
            thought it better to be called a Demon King than to continue living
            in such brutal hell.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it was all in vain. His master, like a ghost, always found out
            about Repenhardt’s attempts to flee and blocked them. And he would
            say this:
          </p>
          <p>
            “My disciple, when I was training under my master, I went through
            all this too. I’ve done all these things, so how could I not
            understand how you feel? But if you endure a bit longer, you’ll see
            that you’ll be rewarded.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In the actual Gym Unbreakable, there was a know-how on the
            “Preemptive Blockage of Disciple Escape Attempts” that had been
            accumulated meticulously over 130 years. Since it was a prestigious
            martial sect where not a single disciple hadn’t attempted to feign
            illness to avoid training or hadn’t tried to run away at some point,
            virtually every conceivable unique attempt had been made at least
            once. This 130 years’ worth of know-how was faithfully reflected in
            the disciple training manual, ensuring that there was no trick
            Repenhardt could attempt that wouldn’t be blocked.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Two months later.</p>
          <p>
            The man called the Devil for his indomitable spirit, Repenhardt,
            eventually abandoned the thought of escaping. Gerard’s surveillance
            network was so persistent that it even made him abandon his lifelong
            beliefs. Moreover, even if he managed to escape by luck, given that
            man’s personality, it was obvious he would be pursued to the ends of
            the continent. He would be caught and returned anyway…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It’s better to formally ask for permission to leave the mountain.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, he remembered what level of mastery the future Teslon
            had achieved and had confirmed that the future Teslon was indeed
            alive. That meant, without a doubt, his body could endure this
            absurd training method and survive. Not just survive, but attain the
            lofty realm of martial arts, becoming the strongest fighter of the
            age.
          </p>
          <p>
            On reflection, it wasn’t a bad deal at all. Knowing for sure that he
            would reach such a state in the future, enduring this level of
            hardship seemed insignificant. Of course, this did not mean he had
            given up on the path of magic…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Wouldn’t a healthy, muscular wizard be better than a frail one,
            after all?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Having changed his mindset, Repenhardt decided to take Gerard’s
            teachings seriously. Well, there wasn’t much about being serious or
            not. It was just about closing his eyes, gritting his teeth, and
            enduring the beatings.
          </p>

          <p>‘Besides, that old man isn’t really a bad person, after all.’</p>
          <p>
            Another reason Repenhardt changed his mind was because of the way
            Gerard treated him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gerard sincerely and genuinely cherished and loved his disciple. He
            was truly dedicated to educating Repenhardt, albeit with a rather
            unsophisticated method of training. However, his eyes were always
            filled with affection and concern for his disciple.
          </p>
          <p>
            This devoted affection was something Repenhardt had never
            experienced before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magicians would make a big deal out of teaching even a single line
            of magic to their apprentices. To learn even the most basic
            1st-circle spell, one had to serve their master like a slave for at
            least three years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, Gerard would even take care of his disciple’s needs. He
            cooked meals (though it’s debatable if it could be called cooking)
            and cleaned (if there was energy left to clean, Gerard would rather
            have Repenhardt take another hit or lift a rock one more time).
            Moreover, there were no tuition fees. Gerard generously spent his
            own money on Repenhardt’s education, covering the costs for meals
            and bathing water, which must have amounted to an astronomical sum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had once boldly asked Gerard what he expected in return
            for doing all this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gerard responded with a look that questioned the absurdity of the
            question.
          </p>
          <p>
            “A master is like a parent. Isn’t it natural to give everything to a
            disciple who is like a child?”
          </p>
          <p>
            This was unimaginable in the relationship between magicians and
            their apprentices. For Repenhardt, who grew up an orphan and spent
            his childhood under a magician, this affection was both burdensome
            and oddly comforting. Thus, he sometimes thought of running away but
            would then remember Gerard’s eyes, his expressions, and decide
            against it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, Gerard had his reasons. He had finally found his successor
            after 30 years. The so-called Gym Unbreakable had lost more than a
            dozen disciples to his brutally unsophisticated training methods in
            the early days. Therefore, it was natural for him to cherish the
            disciple he finally obtained. This cherishing manifested in
            excessive violence, which was Repenhardt’s sorrow, but regardless,
            Gerard was sincerely loving his disciple. There was no doubt about
            that.
          </p>
          <p>Thus, two years passed in this ‘hell filled with love.’</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Today, Repenhardt was again tied to a stake, taking his punishment.
            Shedding the vestiges of boyhood, his physique had undergone a
            transformation, now vastly different from two years ago. Bamboo
            strikes felt refreshing rather than painful to him now. There was no
            longer a need for a gag. His jaw strength, honed to perfection,
            could chew through any gag presented to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, that did not mean the current physical training was
            painless. Gerard was now using a steel mace instead of bamboo to
            beat his disciple.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh, ughh! Ughhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Gritting his teeth, Repenhardt focused intently on the image of
            physical strengthening, along with the unique breathing technique.
            Practicing this continuously amidst the beating somewhat alleviated
            the pain.
          </p>
          <p>It was during such a moment.</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, an unusual sensation surged throughout his body, an
            experience unlike any before.
          </p>

          <p>“Gasp!”</p>
          <p>
            A powerful energy burst from his lower abdomen, swiftly coursing
            through every limb a hundredfold. Filled with this energy, an
            unimaginable strength enveloped him. Unknowingly, Repenhardt twisted
            his body.
          </p>
          <p>Crash!</p>
          <p>
            The thick iron chains binding him (rope could no longer hold
            Repenhardt’s brute strength) shattered, freeing his arms. Repenhardt
            looked at his arms in a daze, noticing a faint golden aura swirling
            around his sturdy muscles.
          </p>
          <p>“What, what is this?”</p>
          <p>“Ahahaha!”</p>
          <p>
            Gerard laughed heartily, patting Repenhardt on the shoulder without
            hiding his joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Congratulations, my disciple. You have finally awakened your Aura.”
          </p>
          <p>Aura, the life force.</p>
          <p>
            A martial artist who has reached a certain realm can feel the energy
            of the world, absorbing it into their body to transform it into
            their own strength. This power, also known as Aura, enhances the
            body to the point where it can smash rocks and leap over walls with
            superhuman strength. Additionally, depending on how the Aura is
            utilized, it can regenerate the body or be projected as a long-range
            attack, exhibiting magical capabilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            The continent is vast, and countless warriors dedicate themselves to
            martial pursuits. Yet, among them, only one in ten thousand reaches
            the realm of manipulating aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even the most basic aura manipulation, simply using aura to enhance
            one’s physical capabilities, could easily earn someone the treatment
            of a knight commander in a small nation. Such is the rarity and
            power of an aura user.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My goodness, is this the legendary aura I’ve heard so much about?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt himself could hardly believe it, repeatedly scanning his
            entire body in awe. Even the Sword Saint Cyrus was said to have
            awakened his aura in his late twenties, an achievement considered
            unprecedented on the continent and worthy of being hailed as a
            genius. And yet, Repenhardt, not even twenty, had awakened his aura?
          </p>
          <p>But Gerard acted as if it was to be expected.</p>
          <p>
            “Why so surprised? With our Gym Unbreakable’s training method, this
            level of achievement is only natural. I was already thinking it was
            about time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, there wouldn’t be such an arduous training method if it
            weren’t effective. Nodding in silent agreement, suddenly, Gerard
            struck Repenhardt’s abdomen with a steel mace he was holding.
          </p>
          <p>Thwack!</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt simply stared as the blow that could shatter rocks
            hammered his abs. There was definitely an impact, but…
          </p>

          <p>Gerard grinned.</p>
          <p>“How is it? It doesn’t hurt anymore, does it?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, master…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt replied in a daze.</p>
          <p>“Wow, it seems all the hardships were worth it.”</p>
          <p>
            The hardships he had endured flashed through his mind like a lantern
            slide. The thought that such rewards could be earned made the
            hellish ordeal seem worthwhile. Gerard had said that he would be
            thankful to his master once he reached this realm, and it seemed
            there was truth in his words after all.
          </p>
          <p>Gerard proudly shrugged his shoulders.</p>
          <p>
            “By striking the entire body to strengthen it, while simultaneously
            stimulating the survival instinct, a strong will to live enhances
            one’s vitality, and this increased strength eventually manifests as
            aura. Though the process is painful, there is no more efficient
            method in the continent to awaken aura! So, my disciple, do you now
            understand the excellence of this training method?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Gerard threw the steel mace onto the ground. There was no need for
            it anymore.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s about time to finish the physical conditioning training.”</p>
          <p>
            Finally, the painful days were over! Repenhardt smiled with joy. He
            was happy to have awakened his aura, but even happier at the thought
            that he would no longer be hit.
          </p>
          <p>Gerard smiled broadly.</p>
          <p>
            “Let’s move on to the next stage. It’s time for skill training.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Ah, now I’ll finally learn some proper martial arts. Then, I can
            leave the mountain soon, right? For these two years, he had done
            nothing but build muscle and get hit. He hadn’t learned a single
            proper punch or kick.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt asked eagerly, “What is skill training, Master?”</p>
          <p>Gerard grinned and raised his fist.</p>
          <p>“Free sparring with me.”</p>
          <p>“……”</p>
          <p>
            Lost for words, Repenhardt looked up at his master’s fists. Those
            two fists, reminiscent of a dwarf-made steel hammer, were shimmering
            with a dazzling golden aura. They looked so brilliantly different in
            quality compared to Repenhardt’s faint aura.
          </p>
          <p>‘How much would it hurt to be hit by that?’</p>
          <p>Soon, Repenhardt would feel the answer himself.</p>
          <p>“Aaaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Feeling Gerard’s ‘loving strikes’ diving into his weak spots,
            Repenhardt was in despair.
          </p>
          <p>The ‘hell filled with love’ had not ended. It had just begun.</p>

            <p>[ Chapter 7 ]</p>
            <p>
              In the southern part of the Vasily Kingdom, deep within the Rakid
              Mountains, lies rugged terrain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beneath a cliff that looks as if it were cut sharply, a waterfall
              cascaded down into a pond below, creating a loud noise of water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next to the water’s edge, where the noise and spray of water
              merge, a robust young man was throwing punches into the air.
            </p>
            <p>“Hup!”</p>
            <p>
              With a simple shout, his fist seemed to tear through the air,
              followed by a rapid succession of punches. The speed of the
              punches was so fast that afterimages remained, and the movements
              were flawless. If there had been an opponent, they would have been
              forced to despair at how the young man’s punches occupied every
              direction flawlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, kicks, spinning kicks, and thrusts followed in basic
              movements. The young man’s limbs teared through the air as he
              continuously stepped, his movements becoming more complex. The
              intricacies of these movements, which involved pulling, pushing,
              raising, and sweeping, contained exquisite techniques that any
              martial artist would admire.
            </p>
            <p>
              The punches and kicks split the air, and just the wind pressure
              alone caused the wind to whirl. The roaring sound of the wind
              filled the clearing.
            </p>
            <p>Woooom!</p>
            <p>
              After a while, the young man, who had been invested in shadow
              fighting (a practice method of imagining an imaginary enemy in the
              air), finally stopped his movements. Standing in place, he turned
              his head towards the cliff with his fist clenched. A dazzling
              golden aura began to ripple and flow out from his fist.
            </p>
            <p>“Phewwww…….”</p>
            <p>
              The young man took a deep breath. His whole body’s muscles
              twitched and swelled. In that state, he pulled his fist back and
              lowered his stance. The pose resembled a beast about to pounce on
              its prey, and the young man muttered softly.
            </p>
            <p>“Calamity Horn.”</p>
            <p>Boom!</p>
            <p>
              Tearing through the atmosphere, the young man’s entire body lunged
              towards the cliff. The golden fist stretched out, creating
              dazzling waves of light. The fist continuously tore through the
              air, and waves of light spread out continuously. Surrounded by
              three waves of light, the young man drove his fist into the cliff.
            </p>
            <p>Bang!</p>

            <p>
              With a loud explosion, the atmosphere vibrated, and a huge crater
              was formed in the cliff, looking as if a meteorite had struck. The
              diameter seemed to be well over 10 meters.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, the waves of light converged towards the fist. The first,
              second, and third waves condensed into a single point,
              transforming into a destructive force. The condensed aura’s waves
              continuously pounded on the cliff.
            </p>
            <p>Bang Bang Bang!</p>
            <p>
              The surroundings shook as if an earthquake had occurred, dust
              billowing up and countless fragments scattering in every
              direction. Moments later, where the dust settled, a massive cave
              now gaped open, clearly not there just three seconds before. The
              cliff hadn’t even collapsed, owing to the concentrated nature of
              the destructive force that had pierced through it. The scene was
              too ghastly to be the work of a mere human fist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, the very person who wrought this miracle seemed unsatisfied.
              The young man, catching his breath and looking at the cliff,
              suddenly sighed deeply.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Huh, is triple-layering still my limit? It feels like I could go
              a bit further if I just tried a bit harder…”
            </p>
            <p>
              The youth, embodying the perfect form of a warrior from head to
              toe, was Repenhardt, who had reincarnated 5 years ago and was now
              21 years old. Having awakened his aura three years ago, Repenhardt
              had been reluctantly following the path of the warrior and had
              gradually become accustomed to life in the mountains. Gerard, his
              master, no longer treated his disciple as harshly as before. Or,
              to be precise, while the intensity of his training remained the
              same, Repenhardt had become robust enough to endure it fairly
              well.
            </p>
            <p>
              “If I could refine my Calamity Horn to a four-layered stack, I
              might finally be able to leave this place, ugh…”
            </p>
            <p>
              Stretching slowly to loosen his muscles, Repenhardt muttered
              discontentedly.
            </p>
            <p>Gym Unbreakable’s ultimate secret technique, Calamity Horn.</p>
            <p>
              A secret martial technique that concentrates all the body’s
              strength into one point, transforming it into destructive power.
              The technique, named ‘Calamity Horn’ because its aura ripples
              converge like a horn, was extremely difficult, only possible for
              those who fully comprehend the martial arts of Gym Unbreakable.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ultimately, achieving a nine-layer stack, capable of killing even
              gods, is a fearsome feat. Teslon in his memories could only manage
              up to a seven-layer stack, and even the current king of martial
              arts, Gerard, had only mastered up to an eight-layer stack. This
              technique truly represented the pinnacle of the martial path that
              Gym Unbreakable aspired to reach.
            </p>
            <p>
              “And master said he won’t allow me to descend the mountain until I
              can perform at least a four-layer stack…”
            </p>
            <p>
              With a clear goal in sight, Repenhardt committed himself more
              actively to training. Seeing his disciple’s changed attitude,
              Gerard didn’t stick to him as closely as before and significantly
              increased the time for personal training. Currently, he had left
              Repenhardt to train alone while he went down to the village to
              replenish their supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
              Observing the position of the sun, Repenhardt estimated the time
              of the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              “It’s been a while since he went down to the village. Perhaps he
              intends to leisurely enjoy a drink?”
            </p>
            <p>
              Previously, Gerard would not even go down to the village. Instead,
              he would spend a considerable amount of money to have supplies
              delivered all the way to these deep mountains. He had to keep
              watch 24 hours a day, as there was always the chance of his
              disciple escaping. Moreover, the volume of supplies needed for the
              disciples’ training was enormous, requiring several carts for
              transportation. No matter how strong and well-built Gerard was, it
              was not feasible for him to carry it all by himself. (Though it
              was possible, it wouldn’t look good.)
            </p>

            <p>
              However, now that Repenhardt’s physique had reached a new level,
              he no longer needed the recovery baths, nor did he need to
              replenish his spent energy with an absurd amount of food thanks to
              his awakened aura. Just buying a moderate amount of food supplies
              was enough, so Gerard had been personally going to the village for
              supplies lately.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I would have seen this as an opportunity to escape before, but…”
            </p>
            <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt smirked bitterly.</p>
            <p>
              He no longer thought about escaping. Having endured so far, it
              felt unjust to escape. He wanted to be fully recognized for his
              efforts and then descend the mountain.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyway, having fully stretched, Repenhardt dusted off his hands
              and feet and walked towards the edge of the clearing.
            </p>
            <p>“Today’s physical training ends here.”</p>
            <p>
              Though he was at the last juncture on his way to descending the
              mountain, he was not in a hurry.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Be it martial arts or magic, it’s all the same. Don’t rush, don’t
              slack.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Hadn’t his master said the same? That in the end, all things are
              alike, and that diligently and steadily working hard is actually
              the shortcut. It seems a bit rich coming from the Gym Unbreakable,
              known for its brutal training method of awakening aura by beating
              someone to the brink of death.
            </p>
            <p>
              Climbing onto a rock, Repenhardt casually brushed off the dust and
              sat down in a lotus position. Closing his eyes, he murmured to
              himself.
            </p>
            <p>
              “As much as martial arts are important, one cannot neglect magic
              either.”
            </p>
            <p>
              With his eyes closed, Repenhardt delved into meditation. After
              being reborn, he spent two years being beaten to unconsciousness,
              without a moment to revive the magic of his past life. However,
              after awakening his aura, he finally had some personal time to
              simultaneously practice magic.
            </p>
            <p>“Sigh…”</p>
            <p>
              Taking a deep breath, he slowly submerged into the depths of his
              mind, gradually recalling the realms of all the magic he had
              learned in his past life, that grand knowledge.
            </p>
            <p>
              In truth, human memory is not entirely reliable. Especially since
              this body does not possess the brain of Repenhardt, renowned
              across the continent for his unparalleled memory. Moreover, for
              the first two years, he was too preoccupied with being beaten to
              even think about making records. There was no such thing as a book
              to record in either. To transcribe his vast knowledge of magic,
              which would fill at least ten volumes, would require more than an
              entire library.
            </p>
            <p>
              It would be normal to have forgotten memories of a past life by
              now…
            </p>
            <p>“Huuuuuu…”</p>

            <p>
              With a simple deep breath, memories of Repenhardt’s past life
              flashed through his mind like a flashback.
            </p>
            <p>What is a flashback?</p>
            <p>
              It refers to when, at the moment of death, one’s entire past
              flashes before their eyes in a panoramic view. And Repenhardt,
              over the past five years, had seen this flashback countless times.
              How many times had he nearly died? Every day was a struggle on the
              brink of death.
            </p>
            <p>
              Seeing the flashback so often, he gradually became adept at it.
              Consequently, Repenhardt developed a new, somewhat bizarre
              ability.
            </p>
            <p>
              He had reached the point where he could ‘artificially’ see a
              flashback. This was a serendipitous result of a soul imbued with
              magical enlightenment, which even the original Teslon did not
              possess, and a muscular body that had survived countless brushes
              with death.
            </p>
            <p>
              He could artificially unfold a ‘flashback’ in his mind and
              contemplate his past. From there, he would extract knowledge of
              magic, as if pulling books off a shelf in a library and carefully
              examining them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Suddenly, Repenhardt raised his hand and stirred the air. A spell
              softly flowed from his mouth.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Delphir la Stellin, I become a bullet that grasps the void to
              strike my enemy.”
            </p>
            <p>
              The three major components of magic are the spell (文: spell), the
              somatic gesture (手印: somatic), and the catalyst (觸媒:
              catalysis). The catalyst for the magic he was casting now was air,
              so there was no need for preparation. After forming the somatic
              gestures continuously for about 20 seconds and barely completing
              the incantation, Repenhardt extended his hand forward and shouted
              the activation word.
            </p>
            <p>“Aero Bullet!”</p>
            <p>
              A bullet of wind flew and hit a tree across the way. Yes, it just
              hit. It didn’t break or snap; the tree just made a ‘puff’ sound
              and shook slightly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking at the slightly shaking tree, Repenhardt clicked his
              tongue.
            </p>
            <p>
              “This is… I remember all the magic, but my body can’t keep up.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt in Teslon’s body lamented the limitations of his
              magical powers and intellect. Despite possessing knowledge and
              understanding, he struggled to accumulate magical energy, and his
              spellcasting speed had significantly decreased. A basic 1st-circle
              spell, Aero Bullet, now took him at least 20 seconds to cast, and
              its power was insufficient, barely more effective than a strong
              adult throwing pebbles.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ah, can this blockhead Teslon truly become a mage?” he sighed.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Repenhardt wasn’t disheartened. Having been the strongest
              mage in his past life, he had already thought of several solutions
              to his predicament. The issue was that he needed to descend the
              mountain first…
            </p>
            <p>
              “I must complete the Quadruple Stack to gain master’s approval,”
              Repenhardt muttered, naturally referring to Gerard as his master.
              Although their master-disciple relationship had formed under
              complicated circumstances, Gerard had indeed trained him and
              shared the secrets of great martial arts, making him worthy of the
              title.
            </p>
            <p>
              Despite the hardships, Repenhardt’s training under Gerard
              continued, filled with extreme and bizarre methods of toughening
              up, including being thrown into ice-cold water in the middle of
              winter, dropped off cliffs, roasted over a campfire, and even
              thrown into a bear’s den with his limbs bound. Gerard cherished
              his disciple, going to lengths that seemed nearly demonic in their
              intensity, regretting only the lack of a nearby volcano for lava
              training.
            </p>
            <p>
              ‘Really, it’s a miracle I survived. No wonder the legendary
              technique known as ‘Artificial Flashback’ came to be.’
            </p>
            <p>
              With a bitter smile, Repenhardt continued to practice his magic.
              Limited by his low magical power to only basic spells for now, he
              was content, knowing that maintaining his magical sense would
              eventually lead him back to his former glory.
            </p>
            <p>“Della di Piana, stream of light, deceive those eyes…”</p>
            <p>
              In the quiet of the mountains, his chant for a spell echoed
              softly.
            </p>

              <p>[ Chapter 8 ]</p>
              <p>
                After completing his magical casting practice and while immersed
                in meditation to accumulate magical power, something caught his
                attention.
              </p>
              <p>“Huh?”</p>
              <p>
                Repenhardt suddenly opened one eye. He sensed something moving
                rapidly beyond the forest. About a hundred meters away? It was
                somewhat melancholic that, as a mage, he was sensing his
                opponent through instinct. However, he continued to focus his
                mind.
              </p>
              <p>‘This presence isn’t human…’</p>
              <p>
                Nor was it a wild animal. It was definitely the presence of a
                being running on two legs through the forest. Repenhardt looked
                towards the source of the sensation with curious eyes. Since his
                reincarnation, this was the first time he was meeting an
                outsider other than Gerard. It was impossible not to be curious.
              </p>
              <p>Soon after, something abruptly popped out of the forest.</p>
              <p>
                It had a stature of about 160 cm, a flat nose, bulging eyes, and
                protruding teeth that came into view. It was a face that would
                frighten humans, but to him, it was all too familiar.
              </p>
              <p>“An orc.”</p>
              <p>
                A small orc with green skin and roughly grown gray hair rushed
                out of the forest, glaring at him. The orc, upon seeing
                Repenhardt, seemed flustered and raised its rusty sword.
              </p>
              <p>“Krurkaka Lokata Kara!”</p>
              <p>
                The orc’s face was filled with hostility. Repenhardt
                inadvertently clicked his tongue at its small and skinny
                appearance.
              </p>
              <p>‘It seems to be just a boy…’</p>
              <p>
                Orcs are usually about the same height as humans. If it’s that
                size, probably around three or four years old? Orcs, a warrior
                race, reach adulthood at five years old, and their youth lasts
                long, so his age seems about right.
              </p>
              <p>Repenhardt observed the orc boy silently with interest.</p>
              <p>
                In fact, when compared to Repenhardt himself, saying the orc boy
                was small and skinny was relative; the body of this orc boy was
                not ordinary. His entire body was well-trained and covered in
                scars, indicating he was a warrior who had experienced many
                battles. Even among orcs known for their bravery, having such a
                physique at that age indicated he possessed significant warrior
                potential. Once again, comparative evaluation can be quite
                frightening.
              </p>
              <p>‘Did he escape from an arena?’</p>
              <p>
                The practice of raising orcs as gladiators to fight to the death
                for entertainment and betting was widespread across the
                continent. It seemed like this orc boy might be in such a
                situation.
              </p>
              <p>“Krurr…”</p>
              <p>
                Because he didn’t show any reaction and just stared at him, the
                orc boy’s demeanor slightly softened. He lowered his sword a
                bit, but still remained on high alert. The orc boy then spoke to
                Repenhardt with a cold voice.
              </p>
              <p>“Human! You, ignore me. Then, won’t kill you!”</p>
              <p>
                As memories of his past life surfaced, Repenhardt found
                amusement in the situation. If it had been a human, they would
                have likely resorted to violence without a second thought. Ah,
                such a noble race that avoids unnecessary killing even in this
                situation.
              </p>
              <p>
                He glanced beyond the forest. Though not visible, he could
                definitely sense a group of armed individuals fervently rushing
                in their direction.
              </p>
              <p>‘Are they after this boy?’</p>
              <p>
                Repenhardt cleared his throat for a moment, then let out a
                growling scream.
              </p>
              <p>“Krarr ok, karal talchata?”</p>
              <p>
                It was Orcish. Given the orc’s vocal structure differs from
                humans, to most humans it would sound like growling. But the
                meaning was different.
              </p>
              <p>“Young orc, are you being chased?”</p>

              <p>
                A spark of interest appeared in the orc boy’s eyes. The boy
                responded in Orcish.
              </p>
              <p>“How does a human speak the blessed language?”</p>
              <p>Repenhardt briefly replied,</p>
              <p>“I had connections.”</p>
              <p>
                In his previous life, reigning as the Demon King, he knew the
                languages of orcs, elves, trolls, dwarves, as well as those of
                ogres, goblins, and gnolls. He could pronounce Orcish as if it
                were his native tongue.
              </p>
              <p>
                The orc boy seemed surprised by Repenhardt’s fluent Orcish. With
                a noticeably softened tone, he murmured,
              </p>
              <p>
                “A blessed connection, indeed. As you say, I am being pursued.”
              </p>
              <p>“I want to help you.”</p>
              <p>
                The orc boy widened his eyes, then shook his head in refusal,
                indicating his objection. Repenhardt, puzzled, asked,
              </p>
              <p>
                “Do you not trust me? Or do you mean you won’t accept help from
                a human?”
              </p>
              <p>
                “That’s not it. One who knows the blessed language is like a
                brother to me. I can feel the sincerity of your goodwill in my
                soul. How could I possibly put such a brother in danger because
                of my situation?”
              </p>
              <p>Repenhardt grew increasingly fond of the orc boy.</p>
              <p>
                Humans might look at the orcs, who seem only to growl, and
                deride them as barbaric and beast-like. However, their
                vocabulary is not much different from that of humans. It’s just
                that their language is rich in tones, and the meaning changes
                with long and short sounds, making it seem like simple noises to
                humans. In fact, orcs, who provide equal educational
                opportunities to all tribe members, often possess a richer
                vocabulary than less educated humans.
              </p>
              <p>
                Moreover, this boy among the orcs was using a particularly
                intellectual tone. Was he born into a good lineage?
              </p>
              <p>
                “I have the ability to help you. And I will not be harmed. Trust
                me.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Repenhardt’s confident demeanor shook the expression of the orc
                boy. Ultimately, the boy nodded. His manner of speech promptly
                changed.
              </p>
              <p>“I shall accept your kindness, benefactor.”</p>
              <p>
                Repenhardt immediately cast a veil of darkness. Though it was a
                simple first-circle spell that summoned darkness to obscure
                vision, casting it in a deeply shadowed area made hiding an orc
                boy trivial.
              </p>
              <p>
                After spreading a veil of darkness over the cave they had just
                made below the cliff, Repenhardt gestured to the boy.
              </p>
              <p>“Hide inside this. My magic will conceal your traces.”</p>
              <p>
                The orc boy, unable to hide his surprise, asked. He was even
                more astonished now than when Repenhardt had spoken in Orcish.
              </p>
              <p>“You are a mage, benefactor?”</p>
              <p>“Is it so strange that I am a mage?”</p>
              <p>“With that body?”</p>
              <p>“……”</p>
              <p>
                Indeed, no one would think of Repenhardt, standing at 185 cm
                tall with his body packed with muscles, as a mage. Repenhardt
                chuckled and continued to gesture towards the darkness. The
                momentarily baffled orc boy soon relaxed his expression and
                stepped into the veil.
              </p>
              <p>“Then I gratefully accept your kindness.”</p>
              <p>
                Immersing himself in the darkness of the veil, the orc boy
                suddenly let out a chuckle. He joked with Repenhardt,<br />
              </p>

              “Come to think of it, there seems to be a similar story in human
              fairy tales. Sadly, I don’t know about places where elves bathe,
              do you?”
              <p></p>
              <p>Repenhardt, smiling back, waved his hand dismissively.</p>
              <p>“No need for that. Just go hide now.”</p>
              <p>
                Truly, his intellectual level was quite high. Even in a dire
                situation, his pride showed, and he even made jokes after
                accepting the other’s kindness.
              </p>
              <p>
                Watching the orc boy disappear into the darkness, Repenhardt
                smiled contentedly. Then, he climbed back atop the rock and
                pretended as if nothing had happened, immersing himself in
                meditation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shortly after, a noisy group of men emerged, breaking through
                the bushes. They were mercenaries affiliated with the arena in
                Chrome City, located near the Rakid Mountains.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their usual duties included managing the arena and occasionally
                capturing escaped slaves. Now, they were all in a foul mood.
              </p>
              <p>
                They initially thought capturing a mere orc child was a trivial
                task. However, this lowly orc managed to outsmart them with
                unusual cunning, evading their pursuit and leading them deep
                into the mountains, frustrating them to no end.
              </p>
              <p>
                “It’s frustrating, isn’t it? To go through all this trouble just
                to earn a few silver coins.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Bright, the leader of this group, grumbled continuously as he
                roughly cut through the bushes with his scimitar, shaped like a
                crescent moon.
              </p>
              <p>
                As they emerged from the bushes into a clearing, they spotted a
                young man sitting on a rock with his eyes closed. Bright called
                out in a harsh voice.
              </p>
              <p>“Hey! You there! Have you seen an orc brat pass by?”</p>
              <p>One of his followers snickered and added,</p>
              <p>“We’ll give you a gold coin if you tell us!”</p>
              <p>Bright was startled and turned to scold him.</p>
              <p>“Hey, what are you talking about?”</p>
              <p>
                The price of a young orc was barely five gold coins, and they
                were supposed to calculate their compensation in silver coins,
                so offering a gold coin would mean making a loss. However, the
                subordinate seemed unconcerned.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Who said anything about actually giving it? We just need the
                information, and then we can ignore him.”
              </p>
              <p>“Ah, right. Heh, heh, heh.”</p>
              <p>
                Their conversation slightly irritated Repenhardt. Bright and his
                group, feeling secure in the distance, murmured among
                themselves, not realizing that Repenhardt, whose hearing had
                developed to an elf-like level, could hear every word
                accurately.
              </p>
              <p>Repenhardt responded indifferently.</p>
              <p>“I don’t know anything.”</p>
              <p>
                Bright looked at Repenhardt suspiciously. The tracks clearly
                showed that the young orc had fled in this direction.
              </p>
              <p>The footprints were very clear.</p>
              <p>‘But he says he doesn’t know?’</p>
              <p>Bright examined the footprints again.</p>
              <p>
                It seemed the footprints led to a creek below a waterfall, and
                beyond that, there was a cave that seemed perfect for hiding.
              </p>
              <p>Bright smirked.</p>
              <p>“Over there. Let’s go.”</p>
              <p>Inwardly, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.</p>

              <p>‘I forgot about the footprints.</p>
              <p>
                Back when he used magic, high-level spells would automatically
                erase any traces or footprints, so it was a mistake. Repenhardt
                quickly positioned himself in front of them.
              </p>
              <p>
                “This is my dwelling. I cannot allow you to enter without
                permission.”
              </p>
              <p>“Eh?”</p>
              <p>
                Bright’s anger flared at the audacity of this ‘mountain bumpkin’
                blocking his way.
              </p>
              <p>“Is this brat insane…?”</p>
              <p>
                Only then did Bright take a closer look at Repenhardt. He hadn’t
                noticed before, but on a closer look, the young man was quite
                well-built. In fact, not just quite, but extremely well-built,
                though unfortunately, Bright lacked the discernment to recognize
                it fully.
              </p>
              <p>
                At any rate, it was clear from a glance that he was muscular and
                formidable. Still, there was no reason to fear since there were
                more than ten of them against one. Moreover, Repenhardt’s height
                was 185 centimeters—not inhumanly large, but tall. Had he been a
                giant of 2.3 meters like Teslon once was, they might have fled
                without looking back. But as it stood, he wasn’t that imposing.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Hey, something’s off about this brat, overpower him. If we beat
                him up, something might come out of it.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Or not. What does it matter if they beat up some mountain
                bumpkin? It’s not like there’s anyone around to complain.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bright chuckled. He had always enjoyed tormenting the weak,
                never feeling remorse for causing unwarranted harm to those
                unrelated to him.
              </p>
              <p>‘These are utterly pitiful guys.’</p>
              <p>
                As Repenhardt frowned, the subordinates, swords still in their
                sheaths, approached him. They taunted him further.
              </p>
              <p>“Hey, kid. Stop messing around and move aside, will you?”</p>
              <p>“Kid, you have a nice body, don’t you?”</p>
              <p>
                “Well, no matter how strong you are, a sword’s strike is the
                same for everyone.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Watching the mercenaries approach mockingly, Repenhardt clenched
                his fist, then relaxed it. He had thought about giving them a
                light punch, but then he remembered Gerard’s words.
              </p>
              <p>
                ‘Your fists are now lethal weapons. Assume that swinging them at
                anyone will likely kill them.’
              </p>
              <p>
                Indeed, Repenhardt had not yet reached the level where he could
                freely manipulate aura like Gerard. And even without aura, his
                fists were as good as sledgehammers.
              </p>
              <p>‘So, what do I do, Master?’</p>
              <p>‘You should show mercy to the weak.’</p>
              <p>
                Thus, Repenhardt decided to show mercy. He picked up a branch
                lying nearby, one that had snapped off due to his earlier
                training.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the school of Gym Unbreakable, using one’s bare fists is
                stronger than any weapon; to wield a weapon is to show mercy.
              </p>
              <p>Of course, the mercenaries did not take it that way.</p>
              <p>“This brat has picked up a stick?”</p>
              <p>“Want to have a go?”</p>
              <p>“Thinks he’s learned something, huh?”</p>
              <p>Repenhardt smirked. Suddenly, his tone changed.</p>
              <p>“Don’t worry. You won’t die from this.”</p>
              <p>
                And then, a dazzling display of staff technique unfolded. In an
                instant, countless staffs left afterimages, raining down on the
                mercenaries’ heads. Their smug expressions vanished, replaced by
                fear.
              </p>
              <p>“Hu, huck!”</p>
              <p>
                What followed were the sounds of beating and screams echoing
                high into the sky.
              </p>
              <p>“Arggh!”</p>
              <p>Thud, thud, thud, thud!</p>

                <p>[ Chapter 9 ]</p>
                <p>
                  Gym Unbreakable is a martial sect that specializes in the
                  extreme training of unarmed combat techniques, but it is not
                  devoid of weapon skills. The skill in question was the staff
                  technique, which was not developed for the purpose of fighting
                  opponents, but for rigorously training disciples. As such, it
                  lacks any defensive maneuvers and focuses solely on offense.
                  Specifically, it’s specialized in evenly tempering the
                  opponent’s body without missing a single inch.
                </p>
                <p>“Damn it! Let’s attack him all at once!”</p>
                <p>
                  As their comrades were quickly defeated, the others rushed in
                  surprise. Drawing their swords from their sheaths, they aimed
                  to kill by stabbing their weapons forward.
                </p>
                <p>“Haah!”</p>
                <p>
                  As they were mercenaries who fought with their lives on the
                  line for a living, it seemed like they were able to find a gap
                  in Repenhardt’s defense. After all, it was to be expected with
                  a style of combat that lacked the concept of defense. A
                  mercenary who charged in thrust powerfully at Repenhardt’s
                  side. However…
                </p>
                <p>-Thud!</p>
                <p>
                  The steel sword was deflected, whirling away to lodge itself
                  in a distant tree. Watching this, Repenhardt smirked bitterly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Ah, is this really a human body? It’s mine, but this is too
                  much.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  From the start, his physique was a shield in itself. There was
                  no need for defense against opponents so weak that they had to
                  wield weapons.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was astonishing for Repenhardt himself, but imagine how the
                  opponents felt? Seeing their swords deflected by his side, the
                  mercenaries lost their will to fight. Repenhardt generously
                  shared with them the experiences he had personally undergone
                  for two years. The woods echoed with their agonizing screams.
                </p>
                <p>“Argh, ah, aah!”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt leisurely muttered while moving his hands non-stop
                  (Somehow, he resembled Gerard),
                </p>
                <p>“Don’t worry, you won’t die.”</p>
                <p>
                  The remarkable aspect of this staff technique is that it never
                  lets the opponent die.
                </p>
                <p>Puff, puff, puff!</p>
                <p>“You won’t die. You just won’t.”</p>
                <p>
                  Even if muscles were torn, tendons were cut, joints were
                  broken, and bones were smashed…
                </p>
                <p>“You definitely won’t die.”</p>
                <p>“Aaaargh!”</p>
                <p>
                  Upon reflection, he thought there might not be a better
                  torture method. He briefly considered using it as a torture
                  technique when the opportunity arose. Once all his comrades
                  were quickly turned into thoroughly tenderized material,
                  Bright finally realized that this young man was no ordinary
                  individual.
                </p>
                <p>“Ugh, state your name!”</p>
                <p>“State my name?”</p>
                <p>
                  From the tone, it seemed he hadn’t regained his senses yet.
                  Repenhardt swung his sitck lightly and moved in front of
                  Bright. Then, he said with a grin,
                </p>
                <p>
                  “It wouldn’t be fair if all your friends ended up like that
                  and you were the only one fine, right?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bright also underwent the unique martial training of Gym
                  Unbreakable. After about a minute, the wooden stick he was
                  using eventually broke. Had he wrapped the stick in aura for
                  protection, it might not have broken so easily, but
                  unfortunately, his aura, specialized for physical
                  strengthening, couldn’t be applied to weapons like those of
                  other martial arts. Such is the trade-off in everything.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the beating ended, Bright finally groaned and spoke.
                </p>
                <p>“Please, save me…….”</p>

                <p>
                  Bright begged incessantly, his mind no longer occupied with
                  the thought of capturing orc slaves. His only thought was to
                  escape this hellish beating. Repenhardt, sensing a deep
                  nostalgia in this scene, smirked and gestured.
                </p>
                <p>“Scram.”</p>
                <p>
                  This simple word was a lifeline to Bright and his companions.
                  They hurriedly supported each other and limped away from the
                  clearing. Watching the mercenaries leave, Repenhardt licked
                  his lips.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‘This was somewhat fun, beating them. It’s a pity it’s over.
                  Maybe I should take on disciples and do this properly?’
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unbeknownst to him, he was already deeply influenced by the
                  philosophy of Gym Unbreakable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the situation ended, an orc boy emerged from behind the
                  curtain. He didn’t hide his shock. Repenhardt’s strength as a
                  warrior was beyond his imagination.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Placing his hand on his chest, the orc boy expressed his
                  gratitude sincerely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “My benefactor, I will never forget this day for as long as I
                  live. I will surely repay this kindness.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the orc’s typical tone, which might sound menacing as
                  if vowing revenge, the sincerity was unmistakable. Repenhardt
                  waved his hand dismissively and asked.
                </p>
                <p>“It doesn’t matter. Do you have a place to go?”</p>
                <p>The orc boy suddenly looked desolate.</p>
                <p>“The world belongs to humans, where could I possibly go?”</p>
                <p>
                  However, his expression soon changed to one of strong will.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Still, the continent is vast, there must be somewhere to lay
                  my head, right? Even if there isn’t, I’d rather die wandering
                  than live as a slave.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though dressed shabbily and covered in wounds, with a rusty
                  sword at his side, the orc boy’s eyes shone with the pride of
                  a warrior. Repenhardt smiled broadly.
                </p>
                <p>“A spirited one, aren’t you?”</p>
                <p>He paused for a moment, then continued.</p>
                <p>
                  “Beyond the Rakid Mountains, to the southeast for about
                  fifteen days on foot, lies a nameless wasteland. A place
                  untouched by human footsteps, thus unnamed, the utmost remote
                  area, called the ‘Land of Trials’ by non-human races.”
                </p>
                <p>He continued speaking towards the curious orc boy.</p>
                <p>
                  “Head there. I’ve heard that orcs live hidden in that place.
                  The Blue Bear Tribe.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The expression on the orc boy’s face noticeably brightened.
                  Were there still free kinsfolk, not enslaved yet? Filled with
                  hope and joy, the boy suddenly adopted a serious demeanor and
                  bowed his head.
                </p>
                <p>Repenhardt, disturbed, asked,</p>
                <p>
                  “Is it appropriate for a warrior to bow his head so readily?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Placing a hand over one’s heart is a sign of respect, but
                  bowing the head signifies absolute submission.
                </p>
                <p>The boy’s tone shifted once again.</p>
                <p>
                  “You have saved me and opened a new path for me. Now, you are
                  my mentor, and should the opportunity arise, I will take up
                  arms for you.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  In orc culture, a mentor is a guide in life, a revered figure.
                  It’s a concept similar to a human ‘master’ yet slightly
                  different; strict obedience is expected, but never at the cost
                  of one’s pride, distinguishing it from slavery. Perhaps akin
                  to the relationship between a monarch and his knight?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indeed, it was the highest form of politeness. And it wasn’t
                  out of place, either. The orc boy asked Repenhardt politely,
                </p>

                <p>“May I inquire the name of my benefactor?”</p>
                <p>“I am…”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt hesitated for a moment. He had been using the
                  surname ‘Winston,’ given to him by the Tower of Delphia.
                  However, a new life had unfolded before him…
                </p>
                <p>“My name is Repenhardt, Repenhardt Wald Antares.”</p>
                <p>
                  In the runic language, ‘Wald Antares’ means ‘Ruler of
                  Antares.’ He decided then to adopt this as his surname, for
                  that was the path he must walk.
                </p>
                <p>“Repenhardt Wald Antares. I shall not forget that name.”</p>
                <p>
                  The orc boy repeated Repenhardt’s name in an awkward human
                  pronunciation and then turned to leave.
                </p>
                <p>“Well then, farewell.”</p>
                <p>“Ah, safe travels.”</p>
                <p>
                  Once decided, a warrior does not hesitate. The orc boy walked
                  away towards the southeast without looking back. Watching his
                  departing figure, Repenhardt suddenly called out,
                </p>
                <p>“Ah, wait! What is your name?”</p>
                <p>
                  He realized he had not asked the boy’s name. As the distance
                  grew, the orc boy shouted back,
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I am the son of Krota, inheritor of Lat’s mantle. Call me
                  Tassid!”
                </p>
                <p>“Eh?”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt’s eyes went wide in surprise. No wonder he felt an
                  inexplicable fondness and comfort around him!
                </p>
                <p>“That boy, he was Tassid?”</p>
                <p>
                  Tassid, one of his Four Heavenly Kings, was an Orc Warrior.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was the chieftain of the Blue Bear Tribe and eventually
                  became the Great Chieftain of all orcs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt stared blankly into the forest from which the orc
                  boy had disappeared. The boy was already furiously running
                  towards the other side of the forest.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He runs without looking back, towards his kin, along the path
                  he was shown, the path he must take.
                </p>
                <p>“How curious, fate is.”</p>
                <p>
                  Feeling the power of destiny anew, Repenhardt wondered. Could
                  it be that Teslon in his prime had also met Tassid? But
                  considering his temperament, it seemed unlikely he would have
                  found and helped a young orc. Perhaps Repenhardt’s choice of
                  this place had twisted fate. After all, this spot wasn’t
                  particularly useful for martial training. He had chosen this
                  clearing next to the waterfall purely for magical training.
                  Anyway, it was curious.
                </p>
                <p>“Ha ha ha…….”</p>
                <p>
                  A smile naturally came to his face. Nostalgia welled up within
                  him. He felt an urge to chase after the boy immediately, to
                  catch up to him. But soon he shook his head.
                </p>
                <p>“It’s not yet time.”</p>
                <p>
                  His loyal subordinate and friend was now following his own
                  destiny. He must not interfere with that path. Fortunately,
                  the Blue Bear Tribe that he had directed him to was the
                  original place of Tassid, likely not greatly twisting fate.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Feeling the receding presence of Tassid, Repenhardt murmured
                  wistfully.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Let us meet again someday. My friend, my brother, descendant
                  of the valiant warrior.”
                </p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                  Half a year had passed since the strange encounter with
                  Tassid.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The mountains were blanketed in white. Thickly piled snow
                  covered everything, and sharp winter winds whipped fiercely
                  over it. At the edge of a frozen lake in the mountains, where
                  one’s breath seemed to freeze, two men were exchanging blows.
                </p>
                <p>“Take this, my disciple!”</p>
                <p>
                  A muscular old man with a massive build let out a powerful
                  punch. In response, a comparatively smaller but still
                  impressively muscular young man dodged and countered with an
                  elbow.
                </p>
                <p>“That’s nothing!”</p>
                <p>
                  The old man, dodging a fierce elbow blow that seemed it could
                  split a face, laughed heartily. Despite the cold, both were
                  dressed lightly, in short sleeves. This sight would usually
                  make one shiver, but their bodies were drenched in sweat,
                  steaming in the cold air.
                </p>
                <p>“Not bad!”</p>
                <p>
                  Exclaiming in admiration, the old man, Gerard, once again
                  aimed a sharp jab at his disciple’s side, a blow that could
                  shatter ribs and tear through organs. Such a casual exchange
                  of potentially deadly blows, to an outsider, might look like a
                  fight to the death between sworn enemies.
                </p>
                <p>“Ugh! Isn’t that a bit too much, Master?”</p>
                <p>
                  Despite grumbling, the young Repenhardt deftly shifted his
                  body to dodge the attack with a mere flicker. Then, he
                  launched himself again, swiftly landing five kicks all over
                  Gerard’s body in quick succession.
                </p>
                <p>Thud, thud, thud, thud, thud!</p>
                <p>
                  With the loud impact, Gerard took a step back. Not missing a
                  beat, Repenhardt immediately engaged in close combat,
                  unleashing a relentless barrage of punches and kicks. Gerard,
                  too, deftly parried these attacks and counterattacked.
                </p>
                <p>“Taah!”</p>
                <p>“Hup!”</p>
                <p>
                  Thus, the muscular master and disciple engaged in a fierce and
                  prolonged battle. Before long, both were enveloped in a
                  dazzling golden aura. The sheer force of their punches and
                  kicks tore through the ground, scattering frost-covered clumps
                  of dirt all around. Having awakened his aura about four years
                  ago, Repenhardt had grown tremendously, now capable of holding
                  his own against Gerard, who was adept in aura manipulation.
                </p>
                <p>“Good. Very good!”</p>
                <p>
                  Gerard wore a satisfied expression. It had been nearly ten
                  years since he started training Repenhardt, and his disciple
                  had become an exceptional martial artist, far exceeding his
                  expectations. Well, to be precise, he had spent about four
                  years training Teslon and then another six years with
                  Repenhardt, so there might be a slight confusion. But to him,
                  a disciple was essentially ‘a sturdy body,’ so it wasn’t
                  really a problem.
                </p>
                <p>“Take this, Repenhardt!”</p>
                <p>Now, Gerard also referred to his disciple as Repenhardt.</p>
                <p>
                  It seemed the constant beating had confused him, as he kept
                  insisting that he was not Teslon but Repenhardt. Valuing his
                  beloved disciple’s wish, he happily corrected himself and
                  called him Repenhardt. The reigning King of Fists possessed a
                  macho boldness, believing that as long as one’s body was
                  strong, it was okay for the mind to be a bit erratic.
                </p>
                <p>“Huh!”</p>
                <p>
                  Gerard inhaled deeply and took a step back, then uttered in a
                  deep voice,
                </p>
                <p>“Spirit Blast!”</p>
                <p>
                  Instantly, golden aura concentrated around the old man’s fist
                  and shot out like a cannon. Repenhardt’s eyes gleamed at the
                  sight of the incoming Spirit Blast. He raised his arms to
                  defend his entire body while aura surged, spiraling around him
                  in a protective whirl.
                </p>
                <p>Boom!</p>
                <p>
                  The Spirit Blast launched by Gerard ricocheted off the
                  spinning aura, flying off into the distance before exploding,
                  proving its formidable power as the frozen, rock-hard ground
                  cratered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Amidst the flying debris, Gerard laughed, lowering his hands.
                </p>
                <p>“You’ve reached a new level with Spiral Guard.”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt, smiling, relaxed his stance. Watching his disciple
                  unwind after the spar, Gerard nodded in approval.
                </p>
                <p>“You’ve improved considerably. But…”</p>
                <p>
                  Suddenly, Gerard eyed Repenhardt up and down, scrutinizing his
                  entire body, and then sighed.
                </p>
                <p>“How come you’re still so small?”</p>

                <div

                  <p>[ Chapter 10 ]</p>
                  <p>
                    At that moment, Repenhardt let out a chuckle. His height
                    currently slightly exceeded 190 centimeters. Small? Compared
                    to his physique in his past life, he was easily a head
                    taller.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Gerard believed that as a disciple of Gym
                    Unbreakable, one should naturally exceed 2 meters in height.
                    In reality, Gerard’s own height was 2.5 meters, and Teslon,
                    whom Repenhardt had met in his past life, was over 2.3
                    meters tall.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Are you properly practicing the breathing technique I
                    taught you? I make sure you’re well-fed, yet I can’t fathom
                    why you’re not growing any taller.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the world of martial artists, especially among martial
                    scholars, physical size is also an important factor in
                    determining combat strength. As such, Gym Unbreakable
                    possessed a unique breathing technique and aura manipulation
                    method that promoted physical growth. It had been over four
                    years since Repenhardt awakened his aura, so he should have
                    easily surpassed 2 meters by now.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard, shaking his head in incomprehension, received an
                    apologetic scratch of the head from Repenhardt.
                  </p>
                  <p>“It seems to be a matter of constitution, Master.”</p>
                  <p>“Is that so? Tsk.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard looked disappointed, but Repenhardt averted his gaze
                    quietly.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Are you crazy? Wanting me to grow even more here?’</p>
                  <p>
                    The truth was, he had not practiced the body growth
                    breathing technique at all. Pretending to do so daily, he
                    instead focused on gathering magical power through magical
                    meditation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Even now, his height was already 20 cm above the continental
                    average. He had absolutely no desire to grow taller. What he
                    sought was to be a healthy magician proficient in martial
                    arts, not a walking statue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘After all, I can’t just give up on the last bit of humanity
                    left in me, Master.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    With a sigh of regret, Gerard stood up. Although
                    disappointed, he, having lived a long life, understood well
                    that not everything in the world goes as one wishes.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Small but sturdy is good enough, isn’t it?’</p>
                  <p>
                    The two moved to the frozen lakeside. The harsh winter cold
                    had solidified the lake, freezing it over with ice more than
                    1 meter thick.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Standing at the edge of the lake, Gerard gestured to
                    Repenhardt.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Let’s see the final result then. Begin!”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, Master.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Regulating his breathing, Repenhardt took a step forward.
                    Calming his racing heart, he concentrated all the martial
                    enlightenment he had learned into a single fist.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Calamity Horn.”</p>
                  <p>
                    With a soft utterance, Repenhardt soared into the air. Then,
                    a golden aura exploded, striking down towards the frozen
                    lake like a meteor.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Taah!”</p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt released his fist, unleashing a series of aura
                    ripples in succession. One, two, three………
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Four!’</p>
                  <p>
                    Enveloped in four aura ripples, Repenhardt struck down upon
                    the frozen lake. The entire lake shuddered violently as a
                    massive crater formed. The earth trembled, and light
                    converged on his fist.
                  </p>
                  <p>Woong, woong, woong, woong!</p>
                  <p>
                    Four thunderous roars echoed as the ripples continuously
                    battered the lake.
                  </p>

                  <p>Kwa, kwa, kwang!</p>
                  <p>
                    Giant chunks of ice, as large as houses, soared into the
                    air. The water gushed up like a reverse waterfall, then
                    showered down like rain, reducing the lake’s volume by a
                    third in an instant. Repenhardt, propelled back into the air
                    by the recoil, was filled with indescribable joy.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘I did it! Quadruple Calamity Horn!’</p>
                  <p>
                    His face was lit with uncontainable delight. Amidst the
                    cascading water and ice shards, he laughed heartily.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Hahaha!”</p>
                  <p>Clap, clap, clap, clap……</p>
                  <p>
                    For the first time, his master applauded him, affirming
                    Repenhardt’s current realm. He was filled with pride.
                  </p>
                  <p>Gerard smiled warmly at his returning disciple.</p>
                  <p>
                    “Good, at this level, you won’t get beaten up anywhere you
                    go.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If Repenhardt, who can deflect steel swords with his bare
                    body and punch holes through cliffs with his fists, was
                    merely considered safe from harm, then surely, he was not
                    meant for ordinary places.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, Repenhardt did not dwell on it. Having achieved his
                    goal, he was wholly immersed in the pleasure of success.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Watching his excited disciple, Gerard spoke in a low voice,
                    mixed with satisfaction and a hint of regret.
                  </p>
                  <p>“It’s about time… to step out into the world…….”</p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard sat solemnly on a simple wooden platform, carved
                    roughly from logs. Before him, Repenhardt knelt
                    respectfully.
                  </p>
                  <p>“You’ve worked hard all this time, my disciple.”</p>
                  <p>Gerard stroked his beard and continued slowly.</p>
                  <p>
                    “Repenhardt, now that you’ve reached this realm, your life
                    is yours to live. Whether you become a sage or a villain, I
                    don’t care. Live the life you desire. That is the reward for
                    your training.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In the Gym Unbreakable, unlike other martial sects, there’s
                    no fancy talk about cultivating both martial skills and
                    morality. The philosophy here was straightforward: those who
                    work hard to gain strength are entitled to enjoy their life
                    to the extent of their efforts.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard also, though he spoke in such a manner, did not truly
                    believe his disciple would become a petty villain. After
                    all, it is said that those who know their own pain can
                    understand the pain of others, isn’t it?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘Our martial sect is unparalleled in deeply understanding
                    our own pain.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Thus, he had no worries about his disciple’s temperament.
                  </p>
                  <p>“However, remember these three things.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard cleared his throat momentarily. It was a new
                    sentiment for him. Sixty years ago, what his master had said
                    to him, he was now saying to his disciple.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “First, it’s good to amass wealth, but as much as possible,
                    do not acquire wealth through injustice.”
                  </p>
                  <p>Repenhardt tilted his head in confusion.</p>
                  <p>“What? Even if it’s okay to become a villain?”</p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard chuckled. How similar they were. He had asked the
                    exact same question when he descended the mountain. It seems
                    people’s thoughts aren’t that different after all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “If you’re going to be a villain anyway, be a villain with
                    class. If one is to be a successor of our martial sect, even
                    as a villain, one should be a stylish villain.”
                  </p>

                  <p>‘What a strange philosophy.’</p>
                  <p>
                    Looking down at Repenhardt, who was inwardly clicking his
                    tongue, Gerard continued.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Second, as much as possible, stand on the side of those who
                    are wronged. I did say it’s okay to become a villain, but
                    wouldn’t it be better to live a life that is praised?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As expected, the disciple asked the same question he had
                    sixty years ago.
                  </p>
                  <p>“The wronged? Not on the side of the weak?”</p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard smiled warmly and repeated the answer his master had
                    given him.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Being weak does not necessarily mean being wronged. And in
                    this world, there aren’t many stronger than you; everyone
                    else is weaker. Then, on what basis will you distinguish
                    between the strong and the weak?”
                  </p>
                  <p>Repenhardt was convinced by the argument.</p>
                  <p>“And third, this is actually the most important.”</p>
                  <p>Suddenly, Gerard’s expression turned serious.</p>
                  <p>
                    “You must never let the lineage of Gym Unbreakable be
                    severed. This is the most important, the greatest duty. You
                    must find a disciple and continue this grand teaching. Do
                    you understand?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard earnestly emphasized this to his disciple. In fact,
                    the first two were merely add-ons to make it not seem too
                    bland. The truly important duty was only one: to find a
                    disciple and continue the lineage.
                  </p>
                  <p>Repenhardt nodded seriously.</p>
                  <p>“Yes, Master. I will surely fulfill it.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt responded with perfect agreement, but his true
                    feelings were a bit different. Honestly, he felt that even
                    if such a vicious teaching were to be discontinued, it
                    wouldn’t be much of a loss.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Moreover, considering the effort Gerard had put into
                    training him, raising a disciple was by no means an easy
                    task. It was not only a matter of enduring hardship, but
                    also of spending a considerable amount of money. However,
                    because of the unconditional affection Gerard had shown him,
                    openly opposing him felt somewhat uncomfortable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Therefore, Repenhardt inwardly decided to compromise
                    appropriately.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘If a child with talent appears, and if I manage to rebuild
                    the empire and have some leisure time, then I will consider
                    raising a disciple, master. But I cannot promise anything.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Gerard laughed heartily, perhaps interpreting his disciple’s
                    expression as a sense of burden for a significant
                    responsibility.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Ha, there’s no need to take it so seriously. Do you think
                    it’s easy to find a child with the right material? It took
                    me 30 years to meet you. There’s no need to dedicate your
                    whole life to this task. Just live your life, and if fate
                    allows, you’ll come across a child with potential. That’s
                    all I want from you.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Having said that, Gerard threw a bundle he had by his side.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Take this. I’ve packed some clothes and a bit of travel
                    money. It should be enough for a while.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    At the mention of money, Repenhardt brightened up and caught
                    the bundle. Then, he discreetly opened the purse inside the
                    bundle. It contained thirty silver coins. At that moment, he
                    was disappointed.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Eh? Is this all?’</p>
                  <p>
                    In truth, thirty silver coins were enough to cover an
                    ordinary commoner’s living expenses for half a year, so it
                    wasn’t a small amount of money. However…
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘With all the wealth you’ve saved up, you could’ve been more
                    generous, sheesh.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Gerard he knew was quite wealthy. Since his youth,
                    Gerard had traveled the continent as an adventurer,
                    exploring various ancient ruins and selling the artifacts he
                    found to amass a great fortune. Even in his older years, he
                    didn’t stop managing his investments through various
                    businesses, making this muscular old man one of the top ten
                    richest people in the Vasily Kingdom, despite appearances.
                    He had set up this remote residence to keep his disciple
                    from escaping, but in fact, he owned a splendid mansion in
                    the kingdom’s capital.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Seeing Repenhardt’s dissatisfied look, Gerard chuckled. It
                    was as if he had expected such a reaction.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    “You see, when a young man has a heavy purse, he tends to
                    become lazy. If you’re short on money, you’ll find yourself
                    in situations where you need to use your fists, and that’s
                    how your skills will truly improve, isn’t it?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In truth, Gerard wasn’t particularly attached to money
                    either. However, raising a disciple in the Gym Unbreakable
                    required substantial resources, so historically, all Fist
                    Kings had the duty to diligently amass wealth from their
                    youth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Indeed, he had already spent more than half of his saved
                    wealth while training Repenhardt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Still, 30 silver coins is…” Repenhardt clicked his tongue
                    repeatedly. The cost of the healing bathwater used during
                    training was ten times that amount.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Just take it, will you? I wish I could give more, but the
                    allowance for disciples descending the mountain is
                    predetermined in our sect. When I descended, it was 25
                    silver coins. Considering inflation, I’ve given you a fair
                    amount.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Somehow, as he spoke, Gerard’s tone turned into that of a
                    servant calculating expenses. Stroking his beard, he coughed
                    awkwardly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘Anyway, it seems counting coins during a touching descent
                    scene is also a tradition of our sect.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless, it was a gift, and Repenhardt should be
                    grateful. Packing his bundle, Repenhardt joked with Gerard.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Aren’t you going to give your departing disciple a gift?”
                  </p>
                  <p>“Ha-ha-ha!”</p>
                  <p>
                    Laughing heartily, Gerard pulled out a parchment and tossed
                    it. Catching it, Repenhardt asked,
                  </p>
                  <p>“What’s this?”</p>
                  <p>
                    It was a map. Intricate mountain terrains were drawn on the
                    parchment with an X marked in the center. The name Setellad
                    Mountain Range was kindly written at the top. The Setellad
                    Mountains were located in the harsh lands of the continent’s
                    northwest.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “If you’re ever nearby, stop by. I’ve prepared a small gift
                    for you there.”
                  </p>
                  <p>“Master…”</p>
                  <p>
                    It seemed he wanted to care for his disciple in this
                    roundabout way since he couldn’t provide money.
                  </p>
                  <p>People are truly wonderful…</p>
                  <p>
                    Feeling a warmth in his eyes, Repenhardt quickly changed the
                    subject.
                  </p>
                  <p>“So, what will you do after I descend, Master?”</p>
                  <p>Gerard’s eyes widened.</p>
                  <p>“Me?”</p>
                  <p>
                    Curiosity about what the temporarily stationed master would
                    do next was genuine. Frankly, Repenhardt hoped to avoid
                    meeting him in the world if possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>Gerard opened his mouth with a relaxed tone.</p>
                  <p>
                    “Having resolved my life’s duty, I guess I’ll wander the
                    world for a while. And if I see a child with potential, I
                    might take them in and teach them.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Our sect has a one-disciple tradition, is it? Are you going
                    to take another disciple?”
                  </p>
                  <p>“Who said our sect has a one-disciple tradition?”</p>
                  <p>
                    Upon reflection, Gerard had never made such a statement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Given the rigor of their training, finding even one suitable
                    candidate per generation would be miraculous. The Gym
                    Unbreakable was actually open to all.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The only requirement was talent. Disregarding character,
                    lineage, family, or wealth, it was, in theory, a very fair
                    sect. It’s just that entrance meant likely death, deterring
                    casual commitment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “I actually want to spread this excellent teaching across
                    the continent, but everyone’s too frail…”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘Well, by that standard, there’s not a single person in the
                    world who isn’t frail…’
                  </p>
                  <p>With a bitter smile, Repenhardt stood up.</p>
                  <p>It was time to leave.</p>
