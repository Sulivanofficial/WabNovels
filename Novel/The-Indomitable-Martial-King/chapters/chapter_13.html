          <p>[ Chapter 121 ]</p>
          <p>
            He pushed off the ground with both feet, leaping up to the head of
            the mounted opponent in one swift motion.
          </p>
          <p>“Hahaha!”</p>
          <p>
            Kadamyte burst into a hearty laugh as he swung his axe-spear
            horizontally. Another knight was cleaved in half, his upper and
            lower body separating and spraying blood. Count Piterran was
            undoubtedly astonished by the prowess of a man who fought mounted
            knights on foot, but to an aura user like Kadamyte, these ordinary
            knights posed no threat. In fact, he felt confident he could take on
            all thirty knights by himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘The Savior has commanded us not to manifest our aura, so it will
            take a lot of time.’
          </p>
          <p>
            After felling his fourth knight, Kadamyte surveyed his surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>Warrior Malroid. Warrior Sloytle.</p>
          <p>
            Other aura users from the Grand Forge were also easily dispatching
            the knights. Like Kadamyte, they refrained from directly channeling
            aura into their axes or hammers. Repenhardt had instructed them to
            conceal their status as aura users in this battle to save their true
            power for a more dramatic and grand stage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this, they were effortlessly handling the knights as if
            playing with children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply using aura to enhance their physical bodies was enough to
            elevate aura users to the level of superhumans. There was no need to
            manifest aura to deal with these knights. They slaughtered their
            opponents without sustaining any injuries, not even a scratch on
            their armor.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Count Piterran felt as if he were trapped in a nightmare.
          </p>
          <p>
            The knights he cherished and nurtured were being killed off so
            easily. While the three dwarves with overwhelming prowess were
            frightening, even the other dwarves were each like monsters,
            matching the knights in combat. As most of his thirty knights fell,
            not a single dwarf had even suffered a minor injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time, an infantry unit of eight hundred finally arrived
            on the battlefield. Count Piterran shouted in a near-tearful voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Infantry! Charge! Charge!”</p>
          <p>
            The infantry charged at the dwarves, swinging their spears. The
            battle of eight hundred against one hundred began.
          </p>
          <p>However, the one hundred were dominating the battlefield.</p>
          <p>
            The hundred dwarven soldiers tore through the infantry like wolves
            among sheep. Blood splattered and screams pierced the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having witnessed the abject defeat of their leaders, the knights,
            the infantry’s morale was already shattered. Although their training
            allowed them to move reflexively upon command, their spirits were
            broken. Soldiers began to flee from various points within the
            infantry ranks.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No, even if their morale had been high, they wouldn’t have stood a
            chance.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, seated on the coachman’s seat, observed the battlefield
            with a bitter smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might look like a battle of eight hundred against one hundred at
            first glance, but the reality was completely different. These were
            the elite warriors of Grand Forge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans often conscripted farmers, taught them the basics, handed
            them spears, and sent them to the battlefield. However, for dwarves
            and orcs, whose populations were precious, warriors and those in
            production roles were distinctly separated. For them, being a
            warrior was equivalent to being a knight among humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, this battle was essentially one where a hundred
            knights were ravaging eight hundred ordinary soldiers. Unlike
            ordinary human knights, these dwarf warriors were extremely trained
            and selected through harsh environments. Ordinary soldiers stood no
            chance against these battle-hardened veterans.
          </p>

          <p>‘It’s worth the trouble of bringing them here.’</p>
          <p>
            Reflecting on the journey so far, Repenhardt chuckled to himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon returning to the Kingdom of Crovence, Repenhardt used a spatial
            portal while acquiring grain from the Taoban Trading Company to move
            the dwarves of Grand Forge en masse to the Kingdom of Crovence. They
            first moved to the Principality of Chatan using the Daiman Stone
            from Grand Forge. From there, they disguised everyone in robes as
            escort troops of the Taoban Trading Company and crossed the southern
            part of the Setelad Mountains. Officially, the warriors of Grand
            Forge held the status of Repenhardt’s personal slaves, and with
            slave documents formally authorized by the Taoban Trading Company,
            they could pass through the Principality of Chatan and enter the
            Kingdom of Crovence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the dwarves currently moved to the Kingdom of Crovence
            included the aura users Kadamyte, Malroid, Sloytle, and a hundred
            warriors. Although the magic corps were still not highly skilled and
            remained in Grand Forge, even this force alone was more than enough
            to counter Count Piterran’s army.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching the battlefield from beside the coachman’s seat, Sillan,
            who was ready to heal any possible injured, stuck out his tongue in
            astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“Still, I didn’t expect it to be this overwhelming.”</p>
          <p>
            “Well, we were thoroughly prepared while they were completely
            unguarded both strategically and mentally. Our objective power was
            higher, and on top of that, the weak were caught off guard, so the
            outcome is obvious, isn’t it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            At Repenhardt’s words, Siris, who was sitting next to him, cast a
            sympathetic glance at the enemy commander. Count Piterran, looking
            as if he was experiencing a nightmare, was shouting frantically.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Fight! They are just dwarves! What can those lowly midgets possibly
            do?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking about it, Count Piterran was by no means an incompetent
            commander. He was a seasoned knight who had participated in numerous
            battles and had thoroughly prepared for this one, checking all the
            factors. There was nothing militarily wrong with his actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Piterran prepared for a game of chess, while Repenhardt had
            brought out the pieces for a different game altogether, perhaps a
            metaphorical set of shogi pieces. The rules were entirely different,
            leaving no room for prediction or effective response. No matter how
            skilled a knight, they couldn’t have anticipated facing three dwarf
            Aura users.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Predicting that would be more divination than military strategy.’
          </p>
          <p>
            As the tide of battle clearly turned, Kadamyte, following prior
            instructions, shouted out loud.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do not chase the fleeing ones! Our mission is merely to escort this
            carriage!”
          </p>
          <p>
            This was meant for Count Piterran’s soldiers to hear, not his own
            allies. Unsurprisingly, upon hearing they wouldn’t be pursued, the
            surviving infantry dropped their weapons and scattered in all
            directions.
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t retreat! Don’t retreat!”</p>
          <p>
            Count Piterran shouted until his voice was hoarse, but he couldn’t
            stop the soldiers from fleeing. By the time he regained his
            composure, he realized he was alone, surrounded by enemies, having
            lost all his knights and soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it…”</p>
          <p>
            Only then did the fear of death surface on Count Piterran’s face.
            Dwarf warriors, their weapons drenched in blood, grinned at him.
            They looked like cats toying with a mouse. Trembling with a mix of
            rage and terror, Count Piterran bellowed.
          </p>
          <p>“Who is your master!”</p>
          <p>
            Even in such dire straits, he couldn’t abandon the belief that these
            dwarfs were someone’s slaves. It was an ingrained mindset of the
            era’s nobility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Piterran’s eyes finally landed on a young swordsman on
            horseback, observing the battle from a distance without
            participating. It was Russ.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s party had stayed by the carriage, anticipating the
            possibility of the dwarfs’ defensive line being breached. Their job
            was to prevent any sabotage of the grains. However, the dwarf
            warriors fought so effectively that they ended up as mere
            spectators.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, Russ was simply watching the battle unfold from horseback
            beside the carriage. To Count Piterran, this made him look like the
            dwarfs’ master.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a face determined for death, Count Piterran raised his sword.
            He shouted with dignity.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Any man of honor would not let a knight die at the hands of such
            lowly creatures!”
          </p>
          <p>The dwarfs exchanged glances, snickering and murmuring.</p>
          <p>“What a bother.”</p>
          <p>“He doesn’t know any better. Can’t really blame him.”</p>
          <p>“True, it’s ignorance, not malice.”</p>
          <p>
            As a dwarf able to hear the voice of truth, he immediately
            understood that Count Piterran was now acknowledging his defeat and,
            like a true knight, desired an “honorable death.” He was so earnest
            that even a sneer couldn’t escape.
          </p>
          <p>Kadamyte gripped his axe-spear and stepped forward.</p>
          <p>“Shall I do it?”</p>
          <p>
            The black-bearded dwarf, Malroid, shook his head and raised his
            hammer.
          </p>
          <p>“No, Kadamyte. I will.”</p>
          <p>The other dwarf warriors murmured in dissent.</p>
          <p>“Hey, can’t I do it?”</p>
          <p>“Exactly. If you go, it’ll be over in one blow.”</p>
          <p>“You’ve done plenty of cutting; take a rest.”</p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t that the dwarves were seeking glory. They were genuinely
            embodying the spirit of helping each other out, offering to take on
            the hard task so that others, who had exerted themselves, could
            rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, for Count Piterran, listening to this conversation was
            enough to make his blood pressure skyrocket and clutch the back of
            his neck in anger.
          </p>
          <p>“You, you wretched creatures!”</p>
          <p>
            Enraged, Piterran spurred his horse. He galloped forward,
            brandishing his spear and charging valiantly into the midst of the
            dwarves, a true exemplar of knighthood.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, someone else rode forward from the other side. It
            wasn’t a dwarf but an orc gladiator, his body covered in scars. He
            wielded a lance and charged ferociously at Count Piterran, shouting,
          </p>
          <p>“Talkata! I will kill you!”</p>
          <p>At this sight, Count Piterran’s rage peaked.</p>

          <p>“A filthy orc dares!”</p>
          <p>
            Count Piterran was aware that some seasoned orc gladiators possessed
            skills on par with knights. But that was strictly on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>An orc daring to charge a knight on horseback?</p>
          <p>“Do you think so little of me!”</p>
          <p>
            For Count Piterran, who believed that no orc could ever have learned
            equestrian skills, it was an absurd situation. His beard quivered
            with fury as he clashed with the orc gladiator, Talkata. Their
            weapons clashed and grazed each other…
          </p>
          <p>Swish!</p>
          <p>
            With a spurt of blood, Count Piterran’s head flew into the air. Even
            in death, his face was filled with anger, unable to believe he could
            be killed.
          </p>
          <p>Thud!</p>
          <p>Rolling…</p>
          <p>
            Piterran’s headless body fell from his horse. His beloved horse ran
            a little before stopping in place. Talkata picked up Piterran’s
            fallen head with his sword and proudly returned to Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Talkata dismounted, knelt, and presented Piterran’s neck, shouting
            in Orcish.
          </p>
          <p>“My lord, I have beheaded the enemy commander!”</p>
          <p>“Uh, yes. Well done.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his chin with a reluctant expression. He
            clicked his tongue while looking at the Orc, Talkata, before him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Click… You’ve been educated, but your ideology hasn’t changed yet…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had not only brought the dwarves from the Grand Forge
            through the Taoban Trading Company. He had previously killed Teriq
            of the Rolpein Trading Company, taken in the elf and orc slaves, and
            entrusted them to the Taoban Trading Company, asking them to teach
            these slaves human education. Now, six months later, seeing an
            opportunity, he had brought them back.
          </p>
          <p>‘The plan has been half-successful, but still…’</p>
          <p>
            Talkata, who had been an orc gladiator, had formally learned
            equestrian skills and had reached a level where he could perform
            mounted combat comparable to any knight. The orcs, who had been mere
            servants, had learned swordsmanship under Talkata and embraced the
            warrior’s spirit, transforming into capable warriors. The elf women,
            who had been prostitutes, had learned accounting and various
            merchant techniques and were now adeptly managing military
            provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sieboldt, the head of the Taoban Trading Company, was also impressed
            by the effectiveness of these orcs and elves learning ‘human-like’
            knowledge and began similar education for his own slaves. Rumor had
            it that other trading companies in the Duchy of Chatan had started
            similar practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Up to this point, everything was going according to Repenhardt’s
            plan…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘But the slaves still don’t show much change in their ideology.’
          </p>
          <p>
            The anticipated awakening of the slaves’ consciousness of freedom
            was nowhere to be seen. The elves and orcs, who had become more
            capable and intelligent than before, had only deepened their loyalty
            to Repenhardt, thinking of him as their true master. While it was
            gratifying that they were loyal and trustworthy, their blind
            servitude to him as their master was problematic.
          </p>
          <p>
            What he desired was for them to transform from dogs into wolves, but
            they had become more loyal hounds.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Well, what did I expect to see results already after just half a
            year? I’m being impatient…’
          </p>
          <p>
            After pondering for a moment, Repenhardt relaxed his expression.
            This was not a plan he expected to see immediate results from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hadn’t Makelin also said? No matter what methods are used, the path
            he must walk is distant. Right now, receiving human education is a
            ‘privilege’ to which they are devoted, but when all slaves start
            being educated and it becomes ‘normal,’ the ideology of the slaves
            will surely change.
          </p>
          <p>There is no need to rush.</p>
          <p>
            If he keeps planting various seeds, eventually some will sprout.

          <p>[ Chapter 122 ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt gestured for Talkata, who was looking at him with eyes
            full of loyalty, to step back and thought to himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I need to entrust him to Kalken and Stalla soon for some mental
            training.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if they still had the mindset of slaves, it didn’t matter. They
            would be placed among their free kin. They would then adopt a sense
            of freedom, and the education they received from humans would become
            a powerful tool for these different races to gain their own freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Talkata drove his horse back to the front of the carriage for
            protection, Repenhardt looked at his back with anticipation. Then he
            turned to the dwarves and said,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright, let’s start preparing to leave! We have a long journey
            ahead of us, don’t we?”
          </p>
          <p>“Understood, savior.”</p>
          <p>
            The dwarves, with Sillan at the center, were already diligently
            tidying up.
          </p>
          <p>
            They gathered the bodies of the dead knights for burial, and Sillan
            used his healing arts on the surviving soldiers. Since the dwarves
            hadn’t dealt any fatal blows to the infantry, most of them had fled,
            leaving only a few injured. With his abundant divine power, Sillan
            healed the wounded to a point where they could move and even
            distributed grains for them to eat on their way home.
          </p>
          <p>‘That guy is doing well.’</p>
          <p>Repenhardt smiled with satisfaction.</p>
          <p>
            To Sillan, it was simply a humanitarian act befitting a priest, but
            to the human soldiers, it meant something different. They had been
            utterly defeated by the dwarves, whom they considered slaves, and
            now they were receiving this merciful treatment. Though their
            ingrained perceptions prevented them from openly expressing
            gratitude, their attitudes toward the dwarves were noticeably
            changing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the battle was settled, the orc warriors climbed back onto the
            driver’s seats and took the reins. The elf women, who had been
            inspecting the quantity and preservation of the grains, also
            prepared to depart. The dwarves donned their robes again and walked
            beside the carriages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The procession of carriages loaded with grain began to rumble along
            the highway once more.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the large reception room on the second floor of Baron Delphina’s
            estate, twenty nobles were gathered.
          </p>
          <p>
            These nobles, who formed the core of Prince Yubel’s faction,
            included influential figures in Crovence Kingdom’s commerce such as
            Count Feonin, Baron Haron, and Count Spal. They were great merchants
            who controlled the kingdom’s trade, alongside nobles from historical
            families like Marquis Got and Duke Raide. They sat around a table,
            deeply engaged in discussion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Feonin, the head of the largest trading company in Crovence
            and Prince Yubel’s maternal grandfather, stroked his white beard and
            began to speak.
          </p>
          <p>“Duke Repenhardt, we are truly grateful for your assistance.”</p>
          <p>
            In fact, Count Feonin was sincerely welcoming this huge magician
            before him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under normal circumstances, they wouldn’t have welcomed Repenhardt
            in this way. There was no reason to trust such a suspicious
            figure—an unidentified foreigner and a mage at that.
          </p>
          <p>However, the situation was different now.</p>
          <p>
            Currently, most of Prince Yubel’s noble supporters had lost their
            territories and retreated to Baron Delphina’s domain. In this war,
            which was as good as lost, the grain that Repenhardt brought was
            nothing short of a lifeline descending into their hell.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thus, none of the nobles of Prince Yubel’s army opposed Repenhardt’s
            joining them. No one even objected to his condition of granting
            autonomy to the non-humans within the Crovence Kingdom. Yubel and
            Repenhardt were rather perplexed by how smoothly the negotiations
            proceeded, having anticipated significant difficulties.
          </p>
          <p>But upon reflection, it was not strange at all.</p>
          <p>
            Prince Yubel’s situation was akin to a chessboard on the brink of
            checkmate. There was no reason to believe Repenhardt approached them
            with ulterior motives. Whether they trusted him and got betrayed or
            didn’t trust him and drove him away, destruction was the only
            outcome left for Prince Yubel’s army.
          </p>
          <p>
            Likewise, the condition regarding the autonomous territory was also
            reasonable. Everyone was on the brink of losing their domains and
            facing execution. Even if they had to give up their lands, they
            would have to agree while crying. To grant the enemy’s territory,
            which held no value to them, only if they won? There was no reason
            to oppose it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, Count Feonin showed reluctance because of another of
            Repenhardt’s demands.
          </p>
          <p>“However, even so, your demand is quite outrageous.”</p>
          <p>
            When Repenhardt first appeared with wagons full of grain, everyone
            cheered. It didn’t seem odd that he brought a large number of
            dwarves and elves with him. For someone as wealthy as him, it was
            natural to have many slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            But when Repenhardt declared that these were not slaves but free
            warriors who had come to join Prince Yubel’s army, and that he
            interacted with them as allies, everyone was left speechless.
          </p>
          <p>
            According to him, these were wild dwarves and elves. Interact with
            them? It was like saying he would interact with packs of wolves or
            tigers.
          </p>
          <p>
            But to dismiss his opinion meant losing the precious grain.
            Desperation made them reluctantly agree, though Repenhardt didn’t
            seem entirely sane.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, that wasn’t enough. Repenhardt now demanded in the meeting that
            the dwarves and elves he brought be formally recognized as military
            forces and contracted like human mercenaries to participate in the
            battles.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Once again, I must stress that their participation is one of the
            conditions for my providing the grain,” Repenhardt reiterated
            firmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Feonin frowned as he looked at the ‘insane’ mage maintaining
            his resolute stance.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘He’s a mage, so he must have used some kind of magic to tame them.
            But to treat those creatures like humans… Ah, the eccentricities of
            mages are truly incorrigible,’ he thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baron Haron spoke up, trying to placate Repenhardt with a soothing
            tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Whatever Your Grace plans within your domain, it is not our
            concern, so we won’t comment on it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A great merchant’s condition is to negotiate well. Baron Haron
            showed generosity by readily agreeing to the condition of the
            autonomous territory before immediately countering Repenhardt’s
            demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But to launch a counterattack with slave races? That is nothing but
            a dream, completely detached from reality. Why are you so
            insistent?”
          </p>
          <p>The other nobles eagerly chimed in from the sidelines.</p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, Lord Repenhardt. Let’s say those creatures know how to
            fight a bit. What can barely a hundred of them do?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Exactly 126, to be precise. And the free orcs and the Blue Bear
            Tribe will join as well.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “What use are wild orcs, who know nothing but savagery, in
            large-scale warfare?”
          </p>

          <p>
            Everyone tried their best to appease Repenhardt, even addressing him
            with the title of ‘Lord,’ though he wasn’t a noble. They all knew
            the truth but couldn’t say it in front of Prince Yubel. With only
            three thousand soldiers left, securing supplies wouldn’t win them
            the war.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with that amount of grain, a prolonged siege was possible!
          </p>
          <p>
            And that would allow them to negotiate with Carsus on favorable
            terms. They would lose a considerable amount of land, but they might
            be able to reclaim some of their territories. But such negotiations
            would inevitably require the head of Prince Yubel, which is why they
            couldn’t bring it up openly in this meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
            For those who had already lost their lands, Repenhardt’s grain was a
            lifeline. Yet, his stubbornness and lack of awareness of the
            situation were exasperating.
          </p>
          <p>The young Baron Galin spoke up in a gentle voice.</p>
          <p>
            “Lord Repenhardt, how much are the dwarves and elves worth that you
            would send them to the battlefield? Wouldn’t it be better to sell
            them and hire mercenaries instead? We could fetch a significant
            price for that number of dwarves and elves in the Principality of
            Chatan. Allow me to look into the trading companies.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In that instant, Repenhardt glared sharply. Speaking again in a firm
            voice, he said,
          </p>
          <p>
            “They are not slaves but free individuals. Let me remind you once
            more, I am here to represent their wishes as an ally.”
          </p>
          <p>Everyone sighed and began to speak.</p>
          <p>“Meaning? What meaning could those dwarves have?”</p>
          <p>“How can primitive wild elves possibly fight?”</p>
          <p>“How frustrating…”</p>
          <p>
            They all lamented, clutching their chests. Observing the atmosphere,
            Repenhardt muttered to himself.
          </p>
          <p>‘I expected this much.’</p>
          <p>
            He had anticipated all these reactions. Gradually, Repenhardt
            decided to reveal his hand.
          </p>
          <p>“Do you not trust them?”</p>
          <p>“Isn’t it obvious?”</p>
          <p>“In that case, let me show you proof.”</p>
          <p>
            The nobles looked at Repenhardt in curiosity. After a brief pause,
            Repenhardt looked around the room, his voice growing stronger.
          </p>
          <p>“We will capture Sinai Fortress with our own strength.”</p>
          <p>
            The expressions of all the nobles simultaneously hardened. Count
            Feonin, his wrinkled face frowning, muttered.
          </p>
          <p>“Did you just say… Sinai Fortress?”</p>

          <p>“That’s correct.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt nodded. Then others began shouting in disbelief.</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            “Are you joking? Do you think Sinai Fortress is some bandit
            hideout?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do you think defeating just Count Piterran makes you a master
            tactician?”
          </p>
          <p>Sinai Fortress.</p>
          <p>
            Located in the central region of the Crovence Kingdom, this massive
            fortress, built with dwarven technology, serves as a gateway to the
            royal capital, Crotin. Currently occupied by the Carsus army, the
            fortress, due to its strategic significance, housed a garrison of
            three thousand soldiers. The garrison alone matched the strength of
            Prince Yubel’s army.
          </p>
          <p>Furthermore…</p>
          <p>
            “You seem unaware, but Sinai Fortress is where Sir Tetsvalt, the
            kingdom’s strongest knight, resides.”
          </p>
          <p>Baron Haron muttered in a voice tinged with fear.</p>
          <p>Tetsvalt von Fernando.</p>
          <p>
            At the age of fifty-five, this seasoned warrior had awakened to his
            aura abilities at forty-five and had been honing them for ten years.
            Alongside Hatsbergen, the Captain of the Royal Knights, he was
            renowned as the strongest knight in the Crovence Kingdom. His
            loyalty was so profound that, despite lacking Fernando’s bloodline,
            he was granted the Fernando name. He was Carsus’s most reliable
            supporter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, Repenhardt had claimed he would capture a heavily fortified
            fortress, defended by the kingdom’s strongest aura user and a
            garrison of three thousand troops, with barely over a hundred
            soldiers, composed mainly of slave races. The others denounced him
            loudly.
          </p>
          <p>“Foolishness…”</p>
          <p>“Clearly, a mage knows nothing about war!”</p>
          <p>
            These reactions were also anticipated. Ignoring the nobles’
            attitudes, Repenhardt shifted his gaze to the head of the table,
            where Prince Yubel had been silently observing the meeting. Bowing
            respectfully, Repenhardt addressed him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “They possess such strength. If properly treated, they will bring
            victory to Prince Yubel.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Prince Yubel raised his hand, silencing the nobles. He looked around
            and spoke.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I fail to see why you are all so angry. What is the issue? If we
            capture Sinai Fortress, it would be excellent. If not, it proves
            your point. Our army has nothing to lose, does it?”
          </p>
          <p>Baron Galin shook his head, looking at Yubel.</p>
          <p>
            “But Your Highness, we would be sending valuable slaves to their
            deaths for nothing.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A hundred dwarves and elves were worth a fortune! To a merchant like
            Baron Galin, discarding such treasure was inconceivable.
          </p>
          <p>Yet Yubel disregarded Galin’s words.</p>
          <p>
            “Isn’t our current need more for provisions than slaves? Ah,
            Repenhardt, you are leaving the supplies behind, correct?”
          </p>
          <p>Pausing, Yubel turned to Repenhardt, who nodded.</p>
          <p>“Of course. We will move with only a week’s worth of rations.”</p>
          <p>
            “Then the supplies will mostly remain here. A mere hundred men, how
            much can they consume? It seems to me we have nothing to lose.”

          <p>[ Chapter 123 ]</p>
          <p>
            The nobles fell silent. Upon reflection, there was indeed nothing to
            lose. What was crucial now was the military provisions. Emotionally,
            they still found it outrageous, but it didn’t seem necessary to
            oppose it.
          </p>
          <p>“His Highness speaks the truth. I will support his proposal.”</p>
          <p>
            Marquis Got stood up, siding with the prince. The nobles seated near
            the marquis also began to express their agreement. Unlike the nobles
            of merchant origin, these were nobles with history and tradition,
            who were present out of respect for Yubel’s bloodline.
          </p>
          <p>
            They had a noble sense of duty, refusing to serve a flawed king even
            at the cost of losing the war. They were disillusioned by the
            self-preservation of the merchant-born nobles. To them, handing over
            their master’s head for their own safety was an act of disgraceful
            dishonor. Thus, they didn’t particularly care about the expense or
            value of the slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            With Marquis Got casting his vote in favor, the merchant-born nobles
            couldn’t oppose any longer. One by one, they began to agree with
            Repenhardt’s opinion. Finally, even Count Feonin, who had held out
            until the end, expressed his approval, prompting Yubel to rise from
            his seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yubel walked slowly, raising the ring on his right hand. As he
            displayed the royal seal, Repenhardt knelt respectfully. Yubel, with
            princely dignity, spoke solemnly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Lord Repenhardt, as the legitimate heir of the Crovence royal
            family, I command you. I assign you the mission of capturing the
            Sinai fortress. Serve with utmost loyalty!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I, Repenhardt, humbly accept your command, Your Highness Yubel!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaving the conference room, Repenhardt immediately exited Baron
            Delphina’s castle and headed towards the nearby forest.
          </p>
          <p>
            After walking through the castle gates and a bit into the forest, he
            arrived at a large clearing with dozens of tents. Near the tents,
            many members of different races were preparing dinner over hanging
            cauldrons. These were the dwarven warriors from the Grand Forge,
            along with the elves and orcs Repenhardt had brought.
          </p>
          <p>
            They all stayed in this forest clearing. Considering that Prince
            Yubel’s troops were living in proper wooden barracks, albeit shabby
            ones, it was quite a rough treatment. However, these people had come
            prepared for such conditions, so there were no complaints.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, Prince Yubel’s side had prepared accommodations for them on
            one side of the barony out of respect for Repenhardt. But that place
            was intended for slaves. As free individuals, they couldn’t possibly
            stay there. Moreover, compared to the cramped, poorly ventilated,
            and unhygienic slave quarters where a dozen or so people were
            crammed into a single room, it was better to camp in the forest and
            breathe fresh air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crossing the open area, Repenhardt arrived at a large tent on the
            outskirts. This was where his companions were staying. Although a
            rather decent accommodation had been specially prepared for them at
            the Baron’s mansion, they had all refused and were lodging together
            with the other races.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing Repenhardt’s footsteps, the tent flap opened, and a
            platinum-haired elf girl stepped out.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, Siris. Did Tassid leave as scheduled?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, he departed with the Black King a short while ago.”</p>
          <p>“Hmm, he needs to keep to the schedule…”</p>
          <p>“Did the meeting go well?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, it went according to plan.”</p>
          <p>
            Following this, Russ, Sillan, and Tilla came out. Sillan asked with
            an incredulous look.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, are we really going to take down Sinai Fortress with just us?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “A hundred warriors from the Blue Bear Tribe will join us, so it’s
            not just us.”
          </p>

          <p>
            “Even so, three thousand against a hundred, no, three thousand
            against two hundred…”
          </p>
          <p>
            As a general military rule, to attack a fortress, you need three
            times the number of defenders. Even if they had more troops, it
            would be insufficient, and here they were planning to capture a
            fortress with just two hundred men. Anyone would dismiss it as
            nonsense, even without being a strategist.
          </p>
          <p>Russ chuckled wryly.</p>
          <p>“What’s even funnier is that we have a chance of winning.”</p>
          <p>
            The combat power of dwarves and orc warriors far exceeded that of
            human knights. Russ, having met both, felt this keenly. Moreover,
            the orc warriors were direwolf riders, giving them a mobility that
            the dwarf warriors lacked. Despite the differences in defense and
            attack, these warriors could easily take on not only ordinary
            infantry but also several human knights alone.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt clicked his tongue and muttered.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s not that the knights of the Crovence Kingdom are weak, but the
            warriors of the Grand Forge and the Blue Bear Tribe are among the
            strongest of dwarves and orcs. With the strongest forces of two
            races gathered, it’s not impossible.”
          </p>
          <p>“It feels like cheating.”</p>
          <p>Siris also smiled bitterly. Russ shrugged his shoulders.</p>
          <p>
            “Besides, if everything goes as planned, there will be six Aura
            users, excluding you, at Sinai Fortress. Ha, six Aura users… it’s a
            sight rare in the history of the continent.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was hard for any kingdom to have more than five Aura users,
            making them incredibly rare. Just the sight of Aura bursting from
            all around Sinai Fortress would severely demoralize the enemy
            soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The status of orcs and dwarves across the continent will rise
            tremendously.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Imagining the scene, Sillan mumbled in an excited voice. Just then,
            a mature-looking elf man approached from a nearby tent and joined
            the conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The elves also have no intention of stepping back. We won’t be the
            same as before!”
          </p>
          <p>It was Relhard, the leader of the Dahnhaim clan.</p>
          <p>
            When Repenhardt had moved the Grand Forge forces, he had briefly
            visited the Dahnhaim clan through a spatial portal. His aim was to
            showcase the strength of various races to the world, and elves could
            not be excluded. Although the Dahnhaim clan’s numbers were small,
            Relhard had joined with twenty elf warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, those twenty elves were no longer what they used to be.
          </p>
          <p>“Friends of the blazing flame!”</p>
          <p>Relhard muttered softly, raising one hand.</p>
          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            Flames erupted, and a giant figure of fire appeared in the air. It
            was Ignatius, the fire spirit. He had manifested the spirit’s
            distinct form in an instant, a level of spirit magic far beyond what
            Relhard had previously been capable of.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thanks to our benefactor, Elvenheim has been revived. Humans will
            no longer dismiss us elves as a weak race.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Relhard, with a determined look, stroked the branch he carried in
            his bosom. It was a branch of Elvenheim, the world tree Repenhardt
            had revived using the bow Nihillen. To aid Elvenheim’s growth, they
            had pruned the tree and always carried the cut branches to practice
            their spirit magic.
          </p>
          <p>Seeing the majesty of Ignatius, Sillan expressed admiration.</p>

          <p>“Wow, that’s amazing!”</p>
          <p>“With the world tree, it’s not so extraordinary.”</p>
          <p>Retracting the fire spirit, Relhard smiled bitterly.</p>
          <p>
            In just a few months, the elves of the Dahnhaim clan had rapidly
            regained their former prowess in spirit magic. It wasn’t so much
            that their skills were exceptional, but rather that elves typically
            achieved such feats when the world tree existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Currently, the world tree is still small, so we need to carry
            branches like this when we move away from it. But in time, other
            elves will also feel the revival of Elvenheim.”
          </p>
          <p>“I’m looking forward to it as well.”</p>
          <p>
            At Repenhardt’s words, Relhard smiled broadly. Just then, someone
            was seen walking from the other side of the forest. Recognizing the
            young man, Siris spoke with astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“Prince Yubel?”</p>
          <p>
            Other nobles despised this open area as a slave lodging and would
            never approach it. But a prince coming here? Surprised, Siris
            watched as Yubel shrugged.
          </p>
          <p>“Finia wanted to meet the other dwarves.”</p>
          <p>
            Sure enough, in the distance, dwarf maiden Finia could be seen
            meeting with other dwarves from the Grand Forge. She chatted
            animatedly, occasionally laughing, with a face full of joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yubel, who was watching the scene with satisfaction, suddenly turned
            his gaze to Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I spoke as planned, but do we really have a chance of winning?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt smiled faintly.</p>
          <p>
            “We do have a chance. However, it doesn’t change the fact that we
            must be prepared to risk our lives.”
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how strong the warriors of the Blue Bear Tribe, the
            Dahnhaim clan, and the Grand Forge were, they were certainly
            outnumbered. The difference in strength, three thousand to two
            hundred, was not something to be ignored.
          </p>
          <p>Yubel nodded and then suddenly smiled.</p>
          <p>“Anyway, seeing Finia’s smile is good enough for me.”</p>
          <p>He then turned to Repenhardt with a serious expression.</p>
          <p>
            “Lord Repenhardt, I know that you don’t sincerely wish to become my
            vassal.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt showed an embarrassed expression. It was true. In front
            of other nobles, he knelt as a vassal, but he never truly intended
            to serve Yubel. Having been an emperor in a past life, how could he
            develop loyalty to a prince of such a small place? It was merely a
            stepping stone to achieve his own goals.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘That dwarf woman, Finia, must have told him. The truth is always
            inconvenient.’
          </p>
          <p>Yubel then relaxed his expression and continued.</p>
          <p>
            “But I don’t mind. As long as your intentions align with mine, I can
            trust you more than my loyal subjects.”
          </p>

          <p>“Thank you for thinking so.”</p>
          <p>
            Yubel’s expression changed from that of a prince to a young man in
            love.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So act as you wish. I will help you. Even if you fail, Lord
            Repenhardt, I will not resent you. Just seeing that smile makes me
            grateful to you.”
          </p>
          <p>It was a love that could never be fulfilled.</p>
          <p>It was a victory that could never be achieved.</p>
          <p>Even though the chances were slim, there was hope.</p>
          <p>
            For that alone, Yubel wanted to thank Repenhardt. He was sincere.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt bowed his head and replied.</p>
          <p>“You will not be disappointed.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The traces of winter had disappeared, and the sunlight was starting
            to get hot in the full bloom of late spring.
          </p>
          <p>
            Loud shouts were erupting from the spacious training ground on one
            side of Sinai Fortress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dark blue aura scattered in all directions. The owner of the aura
            was a middle-aged man with a sturdy build, who was continuously
            swinging a claymore that glowed with a navy blue aura, sweating
            profusely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, the middle-aged man sheathed his sword and caught his
            breath.
          </p>
          <p>“Phew, that’s enough morning training for now.”</p>
          <p>
            A waiting attendant quickly ran up to him and handed him a towel.
          </p>
          <p>“Here you go, Lord Tetsvalt.”</p>
          <p>“Thank you.”</p>
          <p>
            After wiping off his sweat, Tetsvalt handed the towel back to the
            attendant. As he walked back into the building, he muttered to
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>“Another tedious day begins.”</p>
          <p>
            It had already been a month since he had taken charge of Sinai
            Fortress. During that time, all Tetsvalt had done was spend his days
            in the training grounds, swinging his sword.
          </p>
          <p>“I could handle those remnants of the rebels even now…”</p>
          <p>
            Walking along the corridor, Tetsvalt wore a disgruntled expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was no doubt that Sinai Fortress was a crucial stronghold.
            However, it wasn’t significant enough to warrant the defense by
            Tetsvalt, the kingdom’s strongest aura user, the elite Fernando
            Knights, and three thousand troops.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, his legion should have been a storm fiercely sweeping
            away the treacherous Prince Yubel’s army. The reason his legion was
            holed up in the fortress was due to the command of Prince Carsus.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The victory is already assured. There is no need to hasten and
            spill more blood of our soldiers. Wait until we are fully prepared.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Though it was a reason to rejoice, seeing a ruler who cared for the
            well-being of his subordinates even with victory at hand, it was
            tedious for those waiting for battle. He would have preferred if
            Prince Yubel’s army attacked boldly…
          </p>
          <p>
            “But those scoundrels, with their depleted resources, will never do
            that.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, he had no other hobbies to pass the time. Consequently,
            Tetsvalt spent his days swinging his sword, filling the monotonous
            hours.

          <p>[ Chapter 124 ]</p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt was just about to return to his room after passing through
            the hallway when suddenly, a horn resounded.
          </p>
          <p>“Whoooong, whoooong, whoong!”</p>
          <p>Two long blasts followed by a short one.</p>
          <p>It was a signal that the enemy had appeared.</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt made a puzzled expression. He knew very well that the
            current forces under Prince Yubel had no capacity for a
            counterattack. Soon, he saw his lieutenant running towards him.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on!”</p>
          <p>“An enemy attack, Lord Tetsvalt.”</p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt was momentarily taken aback. His lieutenant’s expression
            was too calm. No, it was somewhat surprised, but it was certainly
            not the face of someone facing an enemy. It was more like someone
            who had seen something strange and bizarre.
          </p>
          <p>“Why do you look like that?”</p>
          <p>
            At Tetsvalt’s question, the lieutenant made a peculiar face. He
            hesitated before speaking.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, it seems the enemy has indeed attacked, but…”</p>
          <p>“What do you mean ‘seems’? Either they have or they haven’t.”</p>
          <p>“Umm…”</p>
          <p>After hesitating for a moment, the lieutenant gave a wry smile.</p>
          <p>“I think it would be best if you saw for yourself.”</p>
          <p>
            Equipped with only light armor, Tetsvalt immediately climbed the
            fortress wall. As he looked towards the gently sloping ridge outside
            the fortress, he understood why his lieutenant had made such a face.
          </p>
          <p>“…What is that?”</p>
          <p>The lieutenant replied awkwardly.</p>
          <p>“Are they…the enemy?”</p>
          <p>
            The lieutenant, uncharacteristically for a knight, did not answer
            straightforwardly, trailing off instead. Normally, Tetsvalt would
            have reprimanded his lieutenant for such an attitude, but this time,
            he said nothing. He just stared blankly at the scene outside the
            fortress.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the ridge, a group of soldiers was lined up. From their armor and
            raised flags, it was clear they were an army. But the composition of
            the force was extremely peculiar.
          </p>
          <p>“There are almost no humans, only dwarves?”</p>
          <p>“If you look closely, there are some elves and orcs mixed in…”</p>
          <p>
            The lieutenant scratched his head as he replied to Tetsvalt’s
            question. Tetsvalt clicked his tongue as he looked at the emblem on
            their flag.
          </p>
          <p>“The emblem is definitely that of Prince Yubel’s army…”</p>
          <p>
            In battle, it is customary to wave flags to signal the start of
            combat. And they were certainly initiating battle. From their
            actions, it was clear they intended to challenge the Sinai Fortress
            as part of Prince Yubel’s army.
          </p>
          <p>But…</p>
          <p>“With just that number?”</p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt looked around the fortress. He wondered if there were other
            forces.
          </p>

          <p>There were none.</p>
          <p>
            Undoubtedly, the little over a hundred soldiers before him were all
            there was. About a hundred dwarven warriors, twenty or so elves, and
            six or seven humans without even riding horses were challenging the
            impregnable Sinai Fortress.
          </p>
          <p>
            At this point, he was so dumbfounded that he didn’t know what to
            say.
          </p>
          <p>“What are they doing?”</p>
          <p>
            “They’re slaves. They just do as they’re told by their masters,
            don’t they? They’re probably just following orders.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Why waste such expensive slaves like that? Are they planning to
            throw money away?”
          </p>
          <p>“…Could it be some kind of trap?”</p>
          <p>“That’s possible.”</p>
          <p>
            The situation was so bizarre that he was almost certain it was a
            trap. Tetsvalt’s expression hardened. He gave orders to his
            lieutenant.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Strengthen the defenses and prepare for a possible surprise attack.
            Have the mages use the spell of farsight to scout the surroundings.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The lieutenant, who was selecting the orders to relay, suddenly
            asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Then should we ignore them?”</p>
          <p>Tetsvalt shook his head.</p>
          <p>
            “That would disgrace Prince Carsus. Prepare for battle. A hundred
            cavalry, three hundred infantry, and a hundred archers should
            suffice. Choose ten knights to lead them. Sir Zalt would be a
            suitable commander.”
          </p>
          <p>The lieutenant, surprised, asked,</p>
          <p>“Isn’t that excessive?”</p>
          <p>
            He thought it was too many troops for just a bunch of slave races.
            But Tetsvalt had his reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If it’s a trap, we need that many troops to break through. And it
            would be a waste to just kill them, wouldn’t it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Even if the dwarves could be disregarded, elves were valuable. With
            his keen vision befitting an aura user, Tetsvalt noticed that half
            of the twenty or so elves were women.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Kill all the dwarves and male elves, but capture the female elves.
            If the female elves are wielding swords, they must be Slayers. They
            will be excellent trophies to commend my subordinates’
            achievements.”
          </p>
          <p>The lieutenant nodded with a grin.</p>
          <p>
            Soon after, the gates of Sinai Fortress opened. Ten knights led five
            hundred troops, charging forward imposingly towards the front lines.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The knights of Sinai Fortress charged, raising clouds of dust. The
            forces of Prince Yubel, composed of slaves, also began to run
            towards them with shouts. Leading the charge, Sir Zalt glanced ahead
            and chuckled.
          </p>
          <p>“Living long enough, you see all sorts of ridiculous things.”</p>
          <p>
            The other knights running alongside him had similar expressions.
            Seeing those short, hairy dwarves charging at them, making guttural
            noises, what else could they do but scoff?
          </p>
          <p>As he put on his helmet, Sir Zalt shouted to his surroundings,</p>
          <p>“Remember, we need to capture the female elves! Understood?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir Zalt!”</p>
          <p>
            The response was utterly devoid of tension. As the distance to the
            dwarven group decreased, the knights collectively leveled their
            lances and increased their speed. They planned to plow through the
            dwarves, and the following five hundred troops would mop up the
            remnants.
          </p>
          <p>“In the name of Lord Carsus!”</p>

          <p>Thundering hoofbeats!</p>
          <p>
            Ten knights charged shoulder to shoulder, shaking the very ground.
            They looked like a massive spear forged of steel! Tetsvalt, watching
            from atop the wall, was about to smile in anticipation of the
            impending slaughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, three beams of light shot up from the forefront of the
            dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>Buuuuung!</p>
          <p>
            With a chilling roar, three dwarves wielding a giant axe, a spear,
            and a greatsword leaped directly at the knights. Three beams of
            light—reddish-brown, light green, and deep crimson—swept through the
            knights.
          </p>
          <p>Screams erupted continuously.</p>
          <p>“Keuh!”</p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>“Aaaargh!”</p>
          <p>
            Blood fountains spouted in all directions. The three dwarves,
            emitting beams of destructive light, decapitated the ten knights in
            an instant.
          </p>
          <p>Tetsvalt, observing from the fortress, shouted in astonishment.</p>
          <p>“…Blade Aura?”</p>
          <p>
            The advance slowed dramatically. The following soldiers were all
            taken aback by the scene before them.
          </p>
          <p>“Did Sir Zalt fall?”</p>
          <p>“No way!”</p>
          <p>“How could the knights be defeated?”</p>
          <p>
            The knights, who were supposed to slaughter the enemy and lead the
            charge, were killed in an instant. Moreover, those who had caused
            this unbelievable result were still approaching them, weapons
            glowing brightly.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go, Malroid!”</p>
          <p>“I understand, Kadamyte!”</p>
          <p>
            The three dwarves, who had slaughtered the knights, leaped again.
            This time, their target was the cavalry, closing the distance with
            superhuman speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The five hundred troops led by Sir Zalt had a formation with one
            hundred cavalry at the front, followed by three hundred infantry,
            and one hundred archers covering them. As the cavalry who had been
            diligently following the knights saw the approaching dwarf aura
            users, they screamed.
          </p>
          <p>“My God!”</p>
          <p>“That’s not a dwarf! It’s a dwarf monster!”</p>
          <p>
            Kadamyte, leaping into the panicked cavalry, swung his axe spear.
            Each time, reddish-brown blade aura scattered, slicing horses and
            men in two simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>Kadamyte let out a hearty laugh.</p>
          <p>“Haha! Wicked humans! Now, I avenge my kin!”</p>
          <p>
            Malroid also swung his greatsword, continuously cutting down
            cavalrymen. Wherever his blade passed, crimson aura and crimson
            blood flew, producing countless screams.
          </p>
          <p>
            The three aura users of the Grand Forge utterly ravaged the hundred
            cavalry in an instant. After smashing the heads of three cavalrymen
            with one swing, Sloytle, lifting his light green glowing battle
            hammer, shouted,
          </p>
          <p>“Comrades! Let us show them our strength!”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“Huh huh huh…”</p>

          <p>
            Tetsvalt let out a dry laugh. The scene before his eyes was so
            absurd that he couldn’t even muster anger.
          </p>
          <p>
            A hundred dwarf soldiers were mercilessly pushing back the vastly
            outnumbered Sinai Fortress troops. Each of those dwarves possessed
            terrifying skills, leaving no room for the soldiers to properly
            swing their swords. They were all dying without being able to put up
            any resistance.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, not a single dwarf was dead, or even slightly
            injured. The difference in power was so atrocious that even a scene
            of wolves attacking a flock of sheep seemed peaceful in comparison.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking down from the castle wall, his lieutenant murmured in a
            trembling voice.
          </p>
          <p>“My God, every one of them has the prowess of knights…”</p>
          <p>
            Even the archers were useless. With the battle in chaos, shooting
            arrows would only harm their own side. They should have launched a
            volley before it reached this point, but the commander of the
            archers was momentarily stunned and missed the timing.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, the infantry and archers could do nothing but spill
            their blood on the ground. It took barely a few minutes for a mere
            hundred dwarves to massacre nearly five times their number.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt groaned at the sight of the three main figures who led this
            entire situation—those dwarves, each wielding weapons glowing with
            dazzling light, rampaging like demons. At first, he couldn’t believe
            his eyes, but now he couldn’t deny it.
          </p>
          <p>“Aura users… Dwarves are aura users!”</p>
          <p>
            His lieutenant, who was also watching the situation, murmured in a
            dazed voice.
          </p>
          <p>“What should we do now, Sir Tetsvalt?”</p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt looked back at his lieutenant with equally dazed eyes. A
            full-course display of defying common sense was unfolding, rendering
            even his seasoned judgment ineffective. At that moment, the old mage
            standing beside him, Westrad, hesitated before speaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sir Tetsvalt, if they are truly aura users, the gate is in danger…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Following orders, he had been scouting around the fortress with a
            farsight spell. But seeing the current situation, it was no time to
            report that there were no ambushes. Westrad’s words snapped Tetsvalt
            back to his senses.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dwarves who annihilated the vanguard of Sinai Fortress could be
            seen charging towards the castle gate with renewed vigor. Indeed,
            with the power of an Aura User, they could easily break through even
            the thick gates of Sinai Fortress. Sir Tetsvalt himself was capable
            of such a feat.
          </p>
          <p>He stammered as he spoke,</p>
          <p>
            “Y-Yes… Activate the fortress’s defensive magic immediately, Mage
            Westrad.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon receiving the order, Westrad hurriedly ran towards the fortress
            wall. At the post above the gate, four mages were already standing
            on the magic circle, waiting for him. All were mages sponsored by
            the Fernando ducal family.
          </p>
          <p>“Everyone, begin the defensive magic!”</p>
          <p>At Westrad’s command, they all started chanting spells.</p>
          <p>“By the power, be upon my hand…”</p>
          <p>“By the ancient contract, I request…”</p>
          <p>“Wood becomes rock…”</p>
          <p>“Rock becomes steel…”</p>
          <p>“Become an indestructible shield!”</p>
          <p>
            As a strategic stronghold, Sinai Fortress had high-level defensive
            magic circles installed throughout to defend against powerful magic
            or attacks from Aura Users. The five mages combined their powers to
            activate the protective magic inscribed on the gate. The
            pre-positioned mana stones amplified their magic, imbuing the entire
            fortress with a strong protective force.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Sloytle arrived at the gate and swung his battle
            hammer with a powerful strike.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            A pale green aura struck the center of the gate precisely. A
            tremendous shockwave spread in all directions, shaking the ground
            like an earthquake. However, the gate did not break. As the hammer
            made contact, a faint light dispersed all the destructive power
            outward.
          </p>
          <p>Retrieving his hammer, Sloytle clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>“Tch!”</p>
          <p>Looking down from the wall, Westrad sighed with relief.</p>
          <p>“Phew, we weren’t too late.”</p>
          <p>
            Arrows began to rain down on Sloytle, who had failed to break the
            gate. The garrison of Sinai Fortress, who had initially been
            confused and disoriented, seemed to have prepared for battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sloytle retreated, deflecting the arrows with his hammer. Soon, a
            torrent of arrows fell upon the entire dwarf legion. The dwarves
            raised their shields to protect their heads and withdrew out of
            arrow range.
          </p>
          <p>Watching from a distance, Repenhardt nodded.</p>
          <p>
            “As expected, the defensive magic circle installed at Sinai Fortress
            is of high quality.”

          <p>[ Chapter 125 ]</p>
          <p>
            Currently, Repenhardt was stationed at the ridge where the fortress
            was visible, observing the battle situation. Although it was called
            the main camp, it only consisted of Siris, Sillan, and the group of
            elf women handling the supply wagons, along with Talkata.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the start, with a force of just over a hundred, the main camp
            only had about a dozen people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan looked worried as he watched the dwarves being pushed back.
          </p>
          <p>“It looks bad, doesn’t it, Mr. Repen?”</p>
          <p>“It’s fine. This was expected.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt raised one hand to signal. In response, about twenty elf
            warriors, who had been mingled among the dwarves, separated from the
            formation and stood side by side. They all raised their hands to the
            sky and began to shout.
          </p>
          <p>“O friends of the blazing flame!”</p>
          <p>
            Giant figures of fire appeared all at once. All twenty of them had
            summoned Ignatius, the fire spirit. The flaming giants heated the
            air as they charged towards the fortress. Naturally, the fortress
            troops responded with arrows, but…
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph, ordinary arrows won’t work on Ignatius, the spirit of fire,
            which isn’t a physical being.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Elf Relhard smiled coldly as he watched the spirits charge. Without
            powerful magic, divine power, or aura, they couldn’t be stopped!
          </p>
          <p>
            The twenty fire giants simultaneously struck various parts of the
            fortress. Each strike resounded with explosions and rising flames.
            The defensive magic circle, with strong resistance to aura, magical
            power, and divine power, was completely defenseless against the
            spirit power. Ignatius shook the fortress’s defenses, rapidly
            draining the magic circle’s power.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Finally, the last Ignatius sent by Relhard delivered a blow that
            shattered the defensive magic circle. The mages on the wall coughed
            up blood and collapsed.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>“Gah!”</p>
          <p>
            The faint light of the gate soon faded. Tetsvalt shouted in
            disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>“What is that?”</p>
          <p>
            He had occasionally seen mages summon spirits, but the elves’ method
            was completely different.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a mage to summon a spirit, a complex summoning magic circle was
            required. An elaborate pattern of light should appear, recognizable
            even to a layman. However, these elves summoned spirits without any
            such circle.
          </p>
          <p>A deputy muttered in bafflement.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s like… something out of a children’s fairy tale about spirit
            summoners…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt had read quite a few fairy tales in his childhood. He
            muttered incredulously.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Huh? Do those elves think they’re some kind of fairy-tale beautiful
            spirit summoners?”
          </p>

          <p>
            In fact, in the original versions of the fairy tales, those
            beautiful spirit summoners were indeed elves. However, since all the
            fairy tales and folklore had been revised from a human perspective,
            no one knew that elves could perform spirit summoning anymore.
          </p>
          <p>“Well done, Relhard!”</p>
          <p>
            Kadamyte, who had been parrying arrows, raised his axe spear and
            expressed his gratitude to Relhard. Now that the magic circle
            protecting the gate was gone, there was nothing to hinder them. He
            exhaled a long stream of reddish aura and charged forward.
          </p>
          <p>“Hyah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a vigorous shout, he summoned all his aura. Resonating with the
            earth, he amplified his energy even further. In that state, Kadamyte
            brought down his axe spear. The reddish aura extended and struck the
            gate of Sinai Fortress accurately.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            With a thunderous sound, sawdust and wooden fragments scattered
            everywhere. The thick gate was shattered with a single blow. The
            expressions of everyone in the fortress turned pale.
          </p>
          <p>The gate was broken.</p>
          <p>The fiends were coming inside the fortress.</p>
          <p>
            They advanced like a nightmare, led by monsters wielding dazzling
            aura!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even someone as thick-headed as Tetsvalt couldn’t just stand by and
            watch the situation unfold at this point.
          </p>
          <p>“Fernando Knights! All units, charge!”</p>
          <p>
            After shouting, he drew his sword. Grinding his teeth, he muttered.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ll take care of those bastards myself.”</p>
          <p>
            In fact, even with the gate broken, the dwarves were still few in
            number. Using the fortress structures for a siege would have been a
            rational choice. However, neither Tetsvalt nor anyone else even
            considered that.
          </p>
          <p>
            The very fact that mere slaves had broken through the gate was an
            indelible disgrace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Allowing their filthy footsteps inside the fortress? That itself was
            no different from defeat!
          </p>
          <p>“Repel those monsters!”</p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt mounted his steed and gallantly charged towards the gate.
            The Fernando Knights followed, shouting.
          </p>
          <p>“For the true king!”</p>
          <p>“Let’s show those lowly creatures the true power of knights!”</p>
          <p>
            As Tetsvalt deployed, two thousand troops charged out through the
            east and west gates of the fortress with a loud roar. All but a
            thousand soldiers guarding the fortress were deployed into the
            battlefield.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although it seemed like a straightforward challenge, the dwarves’
            attack was practically a psychological ambush. Even so, the troops
            marched in orderly ranks, forming a siege. This was evidence of
            their considerable elite status.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the individual prowess of the dwarf-elf allied force,
            numbering just over a hundred, facing a force of two thousand was
            indeed a daunting task. Kadamyte shouted urgently.
          </p>

          <p>“Malroid! Sloytle! Protect our comrades!”</p>
          <p>“Got it!”</p>
          <p>
            Malroid and Sloytle spread out, blocking three directions. The
            Fernando Knights, noticing the unguarded side where the aura users
            couldn’t defend, spurred their horses and charged in unison towards
            the dwarves. Holding their lances and increasing their speed, they
            rushed at the dwarves. The dwarven soldiers stood shoulder to
            shoulder, raising their shields to meet the knights’ charge. It was
            a human tactic.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do they think they can stop charging cavalry with just shields?”
            one knight scoffed at their folly, shouting, “I’ll pierce through
            you all, you fools!”
          </p>
          <p>
            In an instant, the knights overwhelmed the dwarven soldiers. Just as
            the heavy hooves of the horses were about to trample the dwarves
            along with their shields…
          </p>
          <p>“Hyah!”</p>
          <p>
            Astonishingly, the dwarves raised their shields, hurling the knights
            away!
          </p>
          <p>Neigh!</p>
          <p>“Aaargh!”</p>
          <p>
            The cries of horses and the screams of knights mingled as the
            leading knights were thrown from their horses. It was the power of
            earth resonance, temporarily increasing their strength tenfold. It
            was a limited technique that could only be used for a brief moment,
            but the seasoned dwarf warriors timed it perfectly to counter the
            knights’ charge. In that instant, they weren’t just soldiers with
            shields; they were as impenetrable as a solid wall.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>“Curse it!”</p>
          <p>
            The other knights cursed. They had barely managed to fend off the
            first attack, but there were still many knights left. Enraged by
            their comrades’ deaths, the knights started to furiously charge at
            the dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>Chaos erupted outside the fortress.</p>
          <p>
            “Where on earth did these bastards come from?” Tetsvalt gritted his
            teeth, swinging his navy-blue aura-infused sword repeatedly. Despite
            having nearly twenty times the number of troops, it was the Sinai
            fortress troops suffering the casualties.
          </p>
          <p>
            These dwarf warriors were nearly impervious to the regular soldiers.
            Their skill was formidable, but the performance of their weapons and
            armor was also extraordinarily superior.
          </p>
          <p>
            One knight, throwing aside a shield crushed by an enemy blow,
            shouted, “Why are their weapons so damn good?”
          </p>
          <p>
            They already knew that dwarves were skilled craftsmen, but the
            quality of the dwarves’ equipment was excessive. Even the finely
            forged dwarf-made weapons of the Fernando knights quickly became
            dull or bent when clashing with the enemy’s gear.
          </p>
          <p>
            But for the dwarves of the Grand Forge, the outcome was natural.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though both sides wielded dwarf-made weapons, the ones used by the
            fortress troops were reluctantly produced as tributes, while those
            used by the warriors here were crafted with the full inheritance of
            their ancestors’ techniques, with utmost care to achieve the highest
            quality for their kin’s warriors. How could there be any comparison?
          </p>
          <p>
            Screams continued to fill the air. Most of them came from the troops
            stationed at Sinai Fortress, but among them were also the cries of
            elves and dwarves. In a brutal battle with odds of twenty to one,
            even the elite of the elves and dwarves could not escape unscathed.
          </p>
          <p>
            And those screams were mostly caused by the hands of the strongest
            knight of Crovence, Tetsvalt, who wielded a dark blue aura.
          </p>
          <p>“You wretches dare to overstep your bounds!”</p>
          <p>
            Cursing, Tetsvalt cut down his enemies one after another. Already,
            more than ten dwarven warriors had become cold corpses by his hand.
            On the other side, Kadamyte, who was fending off the offensive, bit
            his lip at the sight.
          </p>

          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>
            Kadamyte launched himself towards Tetsvalt, quickly closing the
            distance and striking first. A reddish-brown aura traced a circular
            trajectory aimed at Tetsvalt’s head.
          </p>
          <p>“I will take you on!”</p>
          <p>
            “Insolent fool! How dare you, a mere ground beetle, imitate an Aura
            User!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Shouting, Tetsvalt deflected the attack. The clash of auras created
            a powerful rebound that struck both of them.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            As shockwaves rippled out, the two men simultaneously stepped back.
            Tetsvalt’s expression hardened as he adjusted his stance.
          </p>
          <p>‘What is this…?’</p>
          <p>
            In truth, Tetsvalt had still been underestimating them. He had
            assumed that even though they had been lucky enough to awaken their
            auras, dwarves were still dwarves, and in comparison to a proper
            ‘human’ Aura User, they would be halfwits at best.
          </p>
          <p>But with just one clash, he had to change his mind.</p>
          <p>‘He’s not beneath me at all, is he?’</p>
          <p>
            His hand still tingled from the recoil of the aura felt through his
            sword. With a serious expression, Tetsvalt dismounted. In a battle
            between Aura Users, the mobility of a horse was meaningless and
            could even be a hindrance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt had finally acknowledged Kadamyte as a worthy opponent.
          </p>
          <p>Bang! Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Reddish-brown and dark blue auras clashed repeatedly, echoing with
            loud roars. Kadamyte’s axe-spear and Tetsvalt’s longsword
            continually brushed past each other. Deadly strikes rained down on
            both sides, narrowly missing and flowing back into the next move.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other knights engaged in the battle voiced their surprise at the
            sight.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s that guy?”</p>
          <p>“It’s surprising enough that a dwarf is an Aura User…”</p>
          <p>“To think he can go toe-to-toe with Sir Tetsvalt!”</p>
          <p>
            He couldn’t believe the sight before him. Tetsvalt had spent his
            entire life training with the sword and, even after awakening his
            aura, had never neglected his training. Yet, here he was, locked in
            an even battle with a mere dwarf, despite being renowned as the
            strongest knight of the Crovence Kingdom for over ten years.
          </p>
          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            The dark blue aura curved like a whip, aiming for his side. Kadamyte
            tilted his axe-spear to deflect the attack and calmly stared at his
            opponent.
          </p>
          <p>‘As expected, humans are not to be underestimated.’</p>
          <p>
            Sir Tetsvalt was indeed a powerful aura user whose reputation was
            well-deserved. The surge of his dark blue aura and the swordsmanship
            he had honed over decades were formidable even to Kadamyte, who had
            lived for 150 years. In fact, in terms of skill alone, Tetsvalt
            seemed to surpass Kadamyte.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘At his age, he could have only trained in swordsmanship for about
            40 to 50 years, yet he’s better than me…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Deflecting Tetsvalt’s invasive aura, Kadamyte’s expression grew
            bitter.
          </p>
          <p>Humans were indeed a quick race.</p>
          <p>
            When it came to mastering something over the same period, elves and
            dwarves could never match the growth rate of humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Acknowledging the latent potential of humans with a sigh, Kadamyte
            swung his axe-spear even more fiercely. Whenever Kadamyte pressured
            with his powerful, dwarf-like strikes, Tetsvalt evaded with his
            seasoned swordsmanship. The two aura users clashed repeatedly, their
            weapons gleaming with the brilliant light of destruction. Both of
            them were giving their all, relentlessly striking at each other.

          <p>[ Chapter 126 ]</p>
          <p>“Fortunately, Kadamyte can face Tetsvalt.”</p>
          <p>
            Watching the two fiercely battling in the middle of the battlefield,
            Repenhardt sighed in relief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had also heard of Tetsvalt, the strongest knight of
            Crovence, in his previous life. Although Tetsvalt had died of old
            age by the time Repenhardt established the Antares Empire, he was
            well aware of Tetsvalt’s prowess in his prime.
          </p>
          <p>
            While he acknowledged Kadamyte as a powerful Aura User, he wasn’t
            entirely sure if he could stand against Tetsvalt…
          </p>
          <p>‘At least it seems he won’t lose.’</p>
          <p>
            For now, he was relieved. Repenhardt turned his gaze to another part
            of the battlefield. Although Kadamyte was holding off Tetsvalt well,
            the overall battle situation wasn’t promising.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the valiant efforts of the three dwarf Aura Users, the
            formation had not yet collapsed. The elves were also fighting well
            with their powerful spirit magic. There had been no significant
            casualties on their side so far. Most of the increasing number of
            corpses were from the Sinai Fortress garrison.
          </p>
          <p>Even so, the enemy’s numbers remained overwhelming.</p>
          <p>
            Hundreds had fallen, but nearly three hundred knights and over a
            thousand soldiers still pressed on. The fortress troops advanced
            relentlessly like a surging tide, making it dizzying to watch. The
            dwarf-elf allied forces were holding the line like a sturdy dam
            against the current, but signs of fatigue were becoming evident.
          </p>
          <p>Russ gripped his sword hilt and clenched his teeth.</p>
          <p>
            “Hyung! Even with the situation like this, do we still have to stay
            here?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ was waiting in the main camp with Repenhardt because Repenhardt
            hadn’t permitted him to participate in this battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            -This war is to make the world aware of the strength and existence
            of the non-human races. Neither you nor I should intervene. We can
            fight together after winning here, but for now, it is crucial for
            them, the non-human races, to secure victory on their own for it to
            hold any significance.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a reasonable explanation, and Russ had agreed, but seeing the
            old knight exuding that deep blue Aura made him feel regretful. His
            dream was to gain fame as a warrior and return proudly to the Tenes
            family. Watching Tetsvalt, a renowned Aura User from the Crovence
            Kingdom, presented a perfect opportunity to gain such fame, and
            merely observing from the sidelines made him impatient.
          </p>
          <p>Feeling sorry, Repenhardt consoled Russ.</p>
          <p>
            “Just endure this time. I’ll let you fight to your heart’s content
            next time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I understand that, but… if we lose this battle, it won’t mean
            anything, will it?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh, that’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            Once the dam breaks, that vast army will become a torrent and
            overwhelm the dwarf-elf allied forces. If that happens, the
            outnumbered allies will be slaughtered. Before it comes to that,
            they needed to break the enemy’s momentum and turn the tide…
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt bit his lip and grumbled.</p>
          <p>“Why on earth are they taking so long?”</p>
          <p>
            Just as Repenhardt was growing more anxious, he saw a Direwolf
            galloping bravely over the ridge where the main camp was located.
            The rider, a sturdy orc with green skin, was shouting while
            brandishing a greatsword.
          </p>
          <p>“Benefactor! My brothers and sisters have arrived!”</p>

          <p>
            Behind him, about a hundred orcs on Direwolves were charging forward
            with terrifying momentum. These were the orc warriors of the Blue
            Bear Tribe, led by Kalken and Stalla. They had finally arrived.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re late!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt shouted with a mix of joy and frustration. Kalken drew
            his greatsword and laughed heartily.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Apologies, brother! It took a while to avoid the humans’ eyes!”
          </p>
          <p>At this, Repenhardt smacked his forehead.</p>
          <p>‘Ugh, I didn’t consider that.’</p>
          <p>
            Before the battle, he had anticipated that the Sinai Fortress troops
            would use reconnaissance spells to scout the surroundings. He had
            positioned the orcs in a distant forest and asked them to rush in at
            the right moment. However, the orcs had taken a roundabout route to
            avoid detection, causing the delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘That was a mistake. I should have planned their route with that in
            mind…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt knocked himself on the head in self-reproach. It was a
            mistake his past self would never have made. This brain of Teslon’s
            was a problem, leaving gaps even when things were going well.
            Despite Elucion’s voice enhancing his capabilities, there still
            seemed to be shortcomings.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ugh, changing bodies inevitably comes with side effects. I just
            have to live with it.’
          </p>
          <p>
            The Direwolves carrying the orcs kicked up dust as they passed
            Repenhardt’s camp. At the forefront, Stalla raised her fist and
            shouted in Orcish.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go! Warriors of the Blue Spirit!”</p>
          <p>“Kraaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs charged into the heart of the battlefield, urging their
            Direwolves forward with war cries. Their shouts soon transformed
            into a song. The orc war song, meant to rouse their fighting
            spirits, echoed across the battlefield sky.
          </p>
          <p>The blade of the warrior tears the sky!</p>
          <p>The axe of the hero splits the earth!</p>
          <p>We are the great warriors of the Blue Spirit!</p>
          <p>Our hot blood leads us to victory!</p>
          <p>
            Raise your swords! Swing your axes! Split the heads of the
            approaching enemies!
          </p>
          <p>Fight until your heart bursts!</p>
          <p>Fight until your heart bursts!</p>
          <p>The spirit of the warrior will bless us!</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The orc warriors, capitalizing on the mobility of their Direwolves,
            quickly raced over the ridge and charged into the battlefield. The
            beast-mounted, fearsome-looking orcs pierced through the flanks of
            the fortress troops like a spear.
          </p>

          <p>“Aaargh!”</p>
          <p>“Orcs!”</p>
          <p>“Where did such orcs come from?”</p>
          <p>“Monsters! More monsters have appeared!”</p>
          <p>
            The sight of them made the soldiers scream in panic. As the charging
            orcs opened their mouths and roared in unison, the primeval howls,
            akin to the cries of wild beasts, swept over the Sinai Fortress
            troops. This was the orcs’ unique method, the roar of intimidation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Spirits Weapon, the orcs had a taming technique that involved
            imprinting their will onto their beasts (though the orcs themselves
            simply believed they bonded with the beasts through persistent
            effort). This roar was an application of that technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s easier to project residual will onto a living being that shares
            the same kind of will. It’s akin to how it’s easier to hypnotize a
            person than to imbue a rock with a lingering spirit. Imbuing weapons
            with will took a long time, but taming a beast took only a few days,
            and when dealing with people, this kind of instantaneous effect was
            possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            The willpower contained in the orcs’ shouts momentarily shattered
            the soldiers’ mental state. Already disoriented by the sudden
            ambush, their spirits were broken in an instant, causing the
            frontline to collapse. The precarious balance that had been
            maintained was destroyed.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaah!”</p>
          <p>“Help!”</p>
          <p>
            The soldiers began to scream in terror. The formation collapsed in
            seconds, and deserters started to appear. The knights shouted
            continuously, trying to restore their plummeting morale.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it! Get a hold of yourselves! They’re just beasts!”</p>
          <p>
            Of course, it had no effect. The knights’ morale was already at rock
            bottom. The orcs that appeared were all wielding massive, terrifying
            weapons. Even the well-trained knights were intimidated by their
            size.
          </p>
          <p>One knight muttered in a daze.</p>
          <p>“Why in the world do they need to make their weapons so big?”</p>
          <p>
            It was completely contrary to martial common sense. Yet, the orcs
            swung those massive weapons naturally, slaughtering the Sinai
            Fortress troops.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt watched the knights in astonishment and smiled faintly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Surprising, isn’t it? In this era, humans don’t even have basic
            information, let alone the tactics of non-human races.”
          </p>
          <p>There are five intelligent races on the continent.</p>
          <p>
            Their martial arts appear similar but have distinct differences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elves prefer light and sharp weapons. Their innate quick and precise
            movements are reflected in their swordsmanship, making such weapons
            the most suitable for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dwarves consider long weapons to be the best. Due to their shorter
            stature compared to other races, they developed martial arts that
            emphasize long-range weapons to overcome their disadvantage in
            reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trolls dislike weapons crafted by human hands. Troll shamans, or
            Gurus, who harness the power of nature, can only wield their magic
            effectively with unrefined weapons. Thus, they often use crude stone
            axes, bone knives, or wooden clubs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orcs, on the other hand, believe that the bigger and more
            magnificent the weapon, the better. Their racial secret, Spirits
            Weapon, tends to be more powerful the larger the weapon is.
          </p>

          <p>
            Humans, in contrast, don’t have a standardized weapon type due to
            their versatility. If one had to categorize it…
          </p>
          <p>‘They prefer expensive weapons, don’t they?’</p>
          <p>
            Each race has different physical traits, which naturally leads to
            differences in martial arts and tactics. Non-human races have
            continuously studied ways to counter human martial arts, dreaming of
            revenge. In contrast, humans know nothing about their tactics and
            martial arts.
          </p>
          <p>This was the result.</p>
          <p>“Aaaargh!”</p>
          <p>“Ahhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Every time an orc warrior swung his sword, the knights screamed. The
            enormous weapons, empowered by Spirits Weapon, flew through the air
            on their own and struck down enemies.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s a cursed sword!”</p>
          <p>“Help!”</p>
          <p>
            The soldiers panicked and ran in all directions. The knights, too,
            were stunned by the bizarre sight of swords flying autonomously.
            They fell helplessly, never having encountered such tactics before.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan, who was watching the situation unfold next to Repenhardt,
            tilted his head in confusion. Despite the dire situation, it was
            baffling to see over three hundred knights being so easily
            overwhelmed by a hundred orc warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know orc warriors are strong… but isn’t the Fernando Knights
            Order among the most elite? How can there be such a disparity?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “They don’t know,” Repenhardt said, clicking his tongue. He
            continued, “They know nothing about the tactics and skills of
            non-human races. The Fernando Knights Order might be elite, but
            they’re unprepared for this kind of warfare. Orcs use brute strength
            and intimidation, which is very different from the disciplined
            combat the knights are used to.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan nodded, starting to understand. The orc warriors, using their
            Spirits Weapons, were not just fighting with physical force but also
            with psychological warfare. The knights, despite their training and
            skill, were caught off guard and demoralized by these unexpected
            tactics.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Actually, Spirits Weapon has many flaws if you look closely. Even
            now, if they respond calmly, it’s not something they can’t handle.
            They still have the numbers. They just need to form ranks, have one
            side deal with the flying swords, and the rest handle the orcs.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But in the midst of battle, no one would think of such a strategy.
            If they had even basic knowledge about the orcs, they could respond
            adequately…
          </p>
          <p>“Ignorance is truly frightening.”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing Repenhardt’s bitter smile, Sillan felt a mix of emotions.
            Despite his deep goodwill toward the non-human races, he was still
            human. Watching humans be foolishly defeated by other races, even if
            they were the enemy, was unpleasant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Noticing this, Repenhardt gently patted Sillan’s head and spoke
            softly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This world didn’t just make non-human races foolish. Humanity has
            also become foolish. That’s why I want to change the world. I want
            everyone to realize that acknowledging those different from oneself
            ultimately benefits oneself.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was an arrogant statement, but Sillan, witnessing the scene
            before him, couldn’t help but agree. Suddenly, Repenhardt chuckled
            and asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s not pleasant to see humans dying before your eyes, is it?”
          </p>
          <p>“Well, it’s natural. I’m human too.”</p>
          <p>
            “But don’t forget. Elves, dwarves, orcs—though they are different
            races, they are the same ‘people’ as humans.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone else might have been confused. In this era, the word “people”
            is synonymous with “human.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But having met many non-human races, Sillan understood Repenhardt’s
            words.
          </p>
          <p>
            If beings with reason, intelligence, emotions, who can feel joy,
            sorrow, happiness, and anger are considered people…
          </p>
          <p>Elves, dwarves, orcs—they are all people.</p>
          <p>
            Sillan nodded with an understanding expression. The carnage before
            him was indeed horrific, but he was no naive youngster unaware of
            reality. Repenhardt spoke with a solemn voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “They are fighting to live as people. This is that kind of war. And
            they have the right to shed that blood. The blood they have spilled
            over the years amounts to hundreds, thousands of times more than
            this!”

          <p>[ Chapter 127 ]</p>
          <p>
            With the intervention of the Blue Bear Tribe, the tide of battle
            completely reversed.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go, comrades!”</p>
          <p>
            Malroid charged confidently into the midst of the enemy. Until now,
            he had been unable to advance to maintain formation, but the arrival
            of the orcs had caused the enemy lines to collapse. Now, he could
            run wild.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sloytle also leaped forward with a burst of laughter. The elves
            unleashed fire and wind spirits in all directions, felling the enemy
            soldiers. Once the line was broken, even a thousand men were of no
            use. They were all shouting in confusion, not knowing what to do.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, Seiya!”</p>
          <p>
            An old knight, filled with despair, cried out the name of the god
            Seiya. The elite Fernando Knights were being trampled by what they
            considered wild slave races. The situation felt so surreal that it
            naturally drove him to call upon the divine.
          </p>
          <p>
            A massive orc blocked his path. As huge as a mountain and as
            steadfast as a rock, he was Kalken, the chieftain of the Blue Bear
            Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old knight pointed his sword at him and cried out in despair.
          </p>
          <p>“How can a filthy orc harm a human blessed by Seiya!”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken gave a nonchalant expression to the outcry, which was an
            insult if anything. Indeed, even he had to admit orcs lived without
            bathing, so he had no real rebuttal. Water was a precious resource
            in the desolate lands of Deathland.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, you do look clean.”</p>
          <p>Kalken stared at the old knight, rubbing his tusk.</p>
          <p>
            “Did you spend more time bathing than practicing with your sword?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Though rough, his words were understandable in the common tongue.
            The old knight’s face turned red with anger. How could he, as a
            knight, endure such an insult!
          </p>
          <p>“Arrgh!”</p>
          <p>
            The knight charged with a roar, his vision filled with a deep green
            light, like the lushness of a midsummer forest.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            As the decapitated knight fell back, Kalken rode his direwolf
            forward. In his hand was a weapon glowing with a great destructive
            power. The soldiers’ cries of shock echoed around them.
          </p>
          <p>“Blade Aura!”</p>
          <p>“My God! Even there?”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla began to sweep through the battlefield, her twin daggers
            infused with aura. All around the battlefield, the dazzling lights
            of aura, something a person might be lucky to see once in their
            lifetime, were bursting forth repeatedly. The giant beast’s fangs
            cruelly took life after life.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it…”</p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt groaned. He was still locked in combat with Kadamyte.
            Unlike Kadamyte, who focused purely on his immediate opponent,
            Tetsvalt was distracted by the overall battle situation, causing him
            to be gradually pushed back.
          </p>
          <p>‘What in the world is happening…’</p>

          <p>
            Dazzling Blade Auras were blazing from all directions. The level of
            swordsmanship, which Tetsvalt had achieved through a lifetime of
            training and took great pride in, was now appearing so commonly.
          </p>
          <p>
            A faint light flickered in Tetsvalt’s aged eyes. His mind felt
            utterly empty.
          </p>
          <p>“What on earth has happened to the world!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Kadamyte gritted his teeth and raised his halberd
            above his head. Seeing Tetsvalt’s hesitation, he was making his
            final move.
          </p>
          <p>“Yaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a loud yell, Kadamyte swung his halberd down. Despite his
            confusion, Tetsvalt took a steady defensive stance. Although his
            mind was already in a state of panic, his body, honed through
            relentless training, did not abandon its duty even in this
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the halberd and the long sword clashed, waves of Aura spread out.
          </p>
          <p>Woooong!</p>
          <p>
            A crimson light flared and swelled like flames from Kadamyte’s
            entire body. Without missing the timing of the clash, he amplified
            his Aura several times using the power of Earth Resonance. Pushing
            against Tetsvalt’s sword entwined with his halberd, Kadamyte
            shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Go! Haltron!”</p>
          <p>
            In a situation where it had already turned into a contest of
            strength, with the sudden amplification of his opponent’s power,
            there was no way even Tetsvalt could avoid it. The overwhelming
            force crushed Tetsvalt along with his defending sword. Blood burst
            from his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>“Kaaagh!”</p>
          <p>
            With a scream, Tetsvalt’s head split in two along with his helmet.
            From the torn steel, blood and brain matter spouted like a fountain.
            Even as he was dying, he glared. He still couldn’t accept this
            reality.
          </p>
          <p>This is a nightmare!</p>
          <p>It’s nothing but a terrible nightmare!</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Kadamyte swung his halberd horizontally and
            effortlessly severed Tetsvalt’s head.
          </p>
          <p>“I have beheaded the enemy commander!”</p>
          <p>
            Kadamyte raised his halberd and shouted loudly. The dazzling crimson
            Aura pierced the sky. Following him, four streaks of Aura shot up
            from all around the battlefield in response.
          </p>
          <p>“Victory is ours! Now, let’s deal with the remnants!”</p>
          <p>
            Malroid shouted, infusing his voice with Aura. The cry echoed
            thunderously across the sky. The entire allied forces of different
            races, emboldened, charged at the fortress defenders. The Sinai
            Fortress’s army, already demoralized, had no fighting spirit left
            upon hearing of Tetsvalt’s death.
          </p>
          <p>The dwarves charged in unison, swinging their axes.</p>
          <p>
            The elves unleashed flames and wind, scattering sharp sword strikes.
          </p>
          <p>The orcs threw their swords, creating fountains of blood.</p>
          <p>
            They unleashed their rage, carrying the weight of hundreds of years
            of oppression and suffering.
          </p>
          <p>And then…</p>
          <p>
            By the time the shadows of the late spring sun had grown long, Sinai
            Fortress, which had been defended by the strongest knight of
            Crovence and his three thousand troops, had finally fallen to two
            hundred warriors of different races.
          </p>

          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>The capital of the Crovence Kingdom, the royal city of Crotin.</p>
          <p>
            In a reception room situated at the heart of the palace, an angry
            shout echoed.
          </p>
          <p>“What nonsense is this!”</p>
          <p>
            A young man in his late twenties, clad in the lavish attire of a
            noble, slammed his fist on the table. The young man, with dazzling
            blonde hair and green eyes, clearly bore the bloodline of the
            Crovence royal family. In front of him, a middle-aged man bowed his
            head, unsure of what to do.
          </p>
          <p>“But, it’s the truth, Sir Carsus.”</p>
          <p>
            Carsus pressed his hand to his forehead, shaking his head. He
            struggled to calm his rising anger, but it wasn’t easy. The news
            brought by Baron Felik was truly shocking.
          </p>
          <p>The Sinai Fortress had fallen!</p>
          <p>
            The strongest fortress of the Crovence Kingdom had been overrun by
            Prince Yubel’s forces, who had been pushed to their limit. This
            alone was astonishing, but the subsequent report was even more
            shocking.
          </p>
          <p>Most of the three thousand troops were massacred.</p>
          <p>Over a thousand were taken prisoner.</p>
          <p>The elite Fernando Knights, save for a dozen, were all killed.</p>
          <p>And the great knight, Tetsvalt von Fernando, was lost…</p>
          <p>“This is impossible. How could Sir Tetsvalt…”</p>
          <p>
            It was an unprecedented, tragic defeat in the long history of the
            Crovence Kingdom. The details made it even more unbelievable. The
            enemy forces numbered barely two hundred, most of whom were
            non-human slave races.
          </p>
          <p>“Is this truly certain?”</p>
          <p>“From the accounts of the survivors, there is no doubt.”</p>
          <p>
            Baron Felik replied bitterly to Carsus, who continued to shake his
            head. The defeat was so severe that a considerable number of
            surviving troops had fled. Among them, over a hundred had returned
            to the royal city of Crotin.
          </p>
          <p>They all recounted the same facts.</p>
          <p>The enemies were Dwarves, Elves, and Orcs.</p>
          <p>
            Each one was a monstrous being that surpassed knights in combat, and
            five Orc and Dwarf Aura Users were leading them.
          </p>
          <p>
            One Dwarf, wielding a reddish-brown aura, had been seen beheading
            Tetsvalt with his own eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            With so many survivors recounting the same story, it was impossible
            to dismiss it as a lie.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It hasn’t even been a day since I heard of Count Piterran’s fate…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Carsus shook his head. He had just learned of Count Piterran’s death
            the previous day, who had attempted to seize Prince Yubel’s military
            supplies. Unlike the Sinai Fortress, Count Piterran’s importance
            within Carsus’s army was not high, so the information had reached
            the royal city late.
          </p>

          <p>
            At that time, Carsus had scoffed at the mention of Dwarves being
            involved. He had dismissed it as the ramblings of traumatized
            soldiers speaking nonsense out of the fear they experienced on the
            battlefield.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, given the current situation, he began to think that battle
            might have been real as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Frowning, Carsus muttered, “Could they all have been collectively
            mesmerized by powerful magic?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Baron Felik only responded with a bitter smile, knowing it was not
            worth replying to. Carsus quickly fell silent, realizing how absurd
            his own words sounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            To suggest that all those survivors were mesmerized by magic? That
            was even more far-fetched than the idea of Dwarves being Aura Users.
            If such a sorcerer existed, there would be no need for a siege. They
            could simply cast a curse over the entire fortress on their own.
          </p>
          <p>“What about Sir Tetsvalt’s body?” he asked.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, the Prince Yubel’s forces have respectfully prepared it for
            burial and are sending it back to the royal city of Crotin. It
            should arrive in three days…”
          </p>
          <p>
            At Baron Felik’s somber words, Carsus closed his eyes. With all he
            had heard, he could no longer doubt the truth of this news.
          </p>
          <p>“Truly, Sir Tetsvalt has passed away…”</p>
          <p>
            Tetsvalt had been a loyal vassal of the Fernando ducal family and
            Carsus’s own swordsmanship mentor. He was like an uncle who had been
            by his side since childhood.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, my master…”</p>
          <p>
            Overcome with grief, Carsus’s eyes welled with tears. Baron Felik
            watched him with sympathetic eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was indeed a catastrophic defeat, one rarely seen in the history
            of warfare. For the young Carsus, it was an overwhelming blow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, even in his sorrow, Carsus forced himself to regain his
            composure. He muttered calmly, “So, our current forces number twelve
            thousand. With the loss of the Sinai Fortress, the royal city of
            Crotin is also at risk. And the city’s defense force is only about
            four thousand…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Carsus gave a solemn command, “Contact my father and my
            grandfather. And inform the other nobles as well. Gather all their
            forces in the royal city.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Carsus’s father and grandfather were the Duke of Fernando and the
            Marquis of Brozen. Both had returned to their territories with their
            troops. The other nobles had done the same. Due to a poor harvest,
            they could not continue the war and had returned to strengthen their
            own territories.
          </p>
          <p>
            Baron Felik looked puzzled. Although the Sinai Fortress had fallen,
            Prince Yubel’s forces still numbered only three thousand.
            Considering their numerical superiority, was such an action
            necessary?
          </p>
          <p>
            “If we do that and lose our territories, our supply lines could be
            cut…”
          </p>
          <p>However, Carsus spoke firmly.</p>
          <p>
            “No matter the circumstances, it is a fact that they have taken the
            Sinai Fortress. Thus, we cannot judge their strength by numbers
            alone. Lost territories can be reclaimed, but if we lose the
            capital, we cannot recover. They possess the crown and the seal, so
            if they hold a coronation in the capital, the neutral nobles might
            side with Prince Yubel. We must concentrate all our strength in one
            place now.”
          </p>
          <p>“Your judgment is wise.”</p>
          <p>
            Baron Felik bowed his head in admiration. It wasn’t flattery; he
            genuinely felt this way. It had only been a few minutes since he
            heard of the death of his mentor and uncle-like figure, Tetsvalt.
            Yet, he had already regained his composure, embodying the qualities
            of a renowned knight and commander.
          </p>
          <p>To exhibit such cold, quick judgment at such a young age?</p>
          <p>‘Indeed, the true king of this country can only be Sir Carsus!’</p>
          <p>
            Baron Felik rose to carry out the orders. Just then, Carsus spoke
            again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And organize an intelligence unit to gather accurate information.
            We need to know exactly what happened. Do not overlook even the
            smallest detail, and pay special attention!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike other knights, Carsus had studied tactics and strategy
            extensively. Most knights believed that victory could be achieved
            with just bravery and a large number of troops, but the most crucial
            aspects of warfare were supplies and intelligence about the enemy.
          </p>
          <p>
            He didn’t believe the preposterous tale of five Aura Users from
            different races, but it was certain that the enemy had used some
            strategy involving these slave races. To enter battle without
            knowing this would be an improper stance for a commander.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, Sir Carsus.”</p>
          <p>
            Baron Felik bowed and left the room. Once the baron was gone, Carsus
            slumped deeply into his chair and let out a sigh.
          </p>
          <p>“Phew, I thought the throne was within reach…”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 128 ]</p>
          <p>Sinai Fortress, one day after its fall.</p>
          <p>
            A young man stood atop the still-smoldering fortress wall, facing
            the spring breeze as he surveyed the landscape.
          </p>
          <p>“I can’t believe I’m standing here….”</p>
          <p>
            His golden hair fluttered in the wind like the wheat fields, while
            his green eyes roamed the fortress with an expression of deep
            emotion.
          </p>
          <p>A large man in robes, standing beside him, spoke softly.</p>
          <p>“I told you it wouldn’t disappoint, Prince Yubel.”</p>
          <p>Prince Yubel shook his head, looking at Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>
            “Truly… When I heard the news last night, I couldn’t believe it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The news of Sinai Fortress’s fall reached Prince Yubel’s army
            immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before dispatching his troops, Repenhardt had sent messengers to
            other nobles, instructing them to send inspectors to verify their
            battle. He knew they wouldn’t believe the victory without their
            trusted subordinates witnessing it firsthand.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though Repenhardt expected his request to be dismissed as
            unnecessary, the nobles surprisingly complied, each discreetly
            placing a few of their men around the fortress. They didn’t trust in
            Repenhardt’s victory but intended to gather evidence to claim the
            supplies if he failed and fled.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their expectations were brutally shattered. That evening, all
            inspectors returned to Baron Delphina’s territory with dazed
            expressions. They would have dismissed Repenhardt’s message as
            nonsense, but their own loyal subordinates unanimously confirmed the
            fall of Sinai Fortress, leaving no room for doubt.
          </p>
          <p>
            With faces like they had seen ghosts, Prince Yubel and the nobles
            departed Baron Delphina’s territory with their entire forces. The
            strategic value of Sinai Fortress was incomparable to Delphina’s
            territory. Controlling it was akin to holding a knife to the throat
            of the royal capital, Krotin. If the fall was true, relocating the
            main force was imperative. Despite their disbelief, they marched
            their entire army, and at dawn, they triumphantly entered the
            now-conquered Sinai Fortress.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even standing here, it still feels like a dream,” Yubel muttered,
            gazing at his banners fluttering atop the fortress towers. Around
            the fortress, soldiers were busy with post-battle clean-up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon their entry, the first task for Prince Yubel’s army was
            ‘cleaning’. Corpses of Carsus’s soldiers lay strewn across the
            fortress, and with only two hundred allied troops, clearing them all
            was a daunting task. Repenhardt scratched his head and gave a wry
            smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sorry for the unkempt appearance. Managing and housing the
            prisoners with just two hundred people is quite overwhelming.”
          </p>
          <p>Yubel burst into laughter.</p>
          <p>
            “Haha, how could we make such valiant warriors handle the aftermath?
            Have they all been well-fed and rested?”
          </p>

          <p>“They are all resting comfortably, Prince Yubel.”</p>
          <p>
            Currently, the allied forces of different races were each taking
            rooms and recovering from their fatigue inside the large central
            building of the fortress. Yubel asked about this.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s the reaction of the nobles?”</p>
          <p>
            The building was originally used by the Knights of Fernando. The
            concern was that the nobles might not take well to having slave
            races occupying the luxurious rooms once used by knights.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt shrugged his shoulders.</p>
          <p>
            “They might be furious inside, but what can they do? They’ve done
            nothing, and the rooms were already assigned by the time we arrived
            at the fortress.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of merit, the nobles who entered Sinai Fortress were not
            in a position to say anything to the different races.
          </p>
          <p>
            They had been horrified upon entering the fortress and seeing the
            countless piles of corpses. Moreover, according to their
            subordinates, there were as many as five Aura Users among them. No
            matter how deep-seated their prejudices against slave races were,
            the reality was undeniable.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, having witnessed their battle firsthand, they can’t really
            say anything.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Yubel smirked. He spoke as if he had seen the battle of Sinai
            Fortress in person, which was indeed true.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had no intention of ending his ‘different races publicity
            strategy’ with just sending inspectors to the nobles. He knew well
            that humans only hear what they want to hear. So, he had recorded
            the entire battle using a relic from the Age of Silver.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason he stayed at the main camp was not only to avoid
            revealing himself but also because he needed to be in a position
            where he could see the entire battlefield. Using a video recording
            crystal, an artifact from the Age of Silver, he had recorded the
            battle from start to finish and showed it to the nobles as soon as
            Prince Yubel’s army arrived.
          </p>
          <p>‘If you’re going to publicize, you must do it thoroughly.’</p>
          <p>In that ‘screening’, all the nobles saw clearly.</p>
          <p>
            The formidable power of the Dwarves, Orcs, and Elves, and the five
            streams of Aura soaring across the battlefield. Repenhardt didn’t
            forget to zoom in on the moment Kadamyte and Tetsvalt decided the
            victory. The vivid, magnified replay of the strongest knight of the
            Crovence Kingdom being beheaded was enough to terrify the nobles.
          </p>
          <p>“By the way…”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Yubel glanced at the building where the different races
            were staying and continued to speak.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s good to revel in the glory of victory, but for them to engage
            in such a battle with that number, their casualties must have been
            significant. What were the losses?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Seventeen Dwarven warriors and nine Orc warriors died. Fortunately,
            there were no casualties among the Elves, but they were all
            seriously injured. If you ask about the number of wounded, I would
            have to say all of them are injured.”
          </p>

          <p>
            As it was, Sillan and the clerics of Redanti from Prince Yubel’s
            army were sweating profusely as they healed the wounded of the
            different races. The battle had been so brutal that many had
            sustained injuries beyond immediate recovery. Without the immense
            holy power of Sillan, the number of fatalities might have been much
            higher.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah, deciding to bring him along was the best decision of this
            life.’
          </p>
          <p>At that moment, Yubel wore a bitter expression.</p>
          <p>
            “Considering the enemy’s numbers, one might say it’s minor, but
            given their numbers, it’s indeed a significant loss.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching Yubel lament earnestly, Repenhardt was impressed
            internally.
          </p>
          <p>‘Oh? This guy is a much more competent prince than I thought?’</p>
          <p>
            An ordinary prince wouldn’t have cared about such losses. It wasn’t
            just that he was soft-hearted and lamenting over a single life.
            Yubel was accurately assessing the strength of the different races,
            mourning the loss of renowned knights.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Honestly, I felt a bit guilty about backing him instead of Carsus…’
          </p>
          <p>
            In the previous life, after becoming king, Carsus had ruled Crovence
            Kingdom as a wise and renowned ruler. Under his reign, the kingdom
            prospered, and the people lived in peace and wealth, praising him
            highly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Replacing such a Carsus and attempting to enthrone the debauched
            Prince Yubel had pricked Repenhardt’s conscience. But seeing Yubel
            now, if not for his love for Finia, he seemed to have no reason to
            be slandered. Yubel was also wise, quick in judgment, and possessed
            the dignity of a prince who faced reality without arrogance.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Hmm, if both have the qualifications of a king, then supporting the
            one who matches my preference is the right choice.’
          </p>
          <p>With a much lighter heart, Repenhardt bowed his head.</p>
          <p>
            “Then, Prince Yubel, I will take my leave. There is much to be
            done.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, indeed. I’ve kept a weary man for too long, go and rest.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt hadn’t done anything during the battle except commentate
            and record it. What fatigue? Smiling wryly, he descended from the
            wall.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The attitudes of the nobles had clearly changed. Repenhardt had
            kindly shown them the video, and since all that they saw matched the
            reports of their subordinates, how could they not believe?
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the responses varied from person to person, at least among
            Prince Yubel’s forces, there were no longer any who called the
            different races incompetent.
          </p>
          <p>The only problem was…</p>

          <p>‘Even so, there are still some who talk nonsense like this.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt sighed inwardly as he looked at the thin man before him,
            Viscount Damon. The man was rubbing his hands together, speaking in
            a sly voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Our family’s wealth is considerable. We can afford whatever price
            you name.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Viscount Damon was currently proposing to buy the Dwarven Aura
            Users, Kadamyte and Malroid, from him. Despite witnessing the
            remarkable prowess of the different races, he remained stuck in his
            prejudices. He believed that their strength wasn’t due to their own
            capabilities but rather to Repenhardt’s extraordinary ability to
            command them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You are mistaken. They are not slaves. They are proud allies of
            ours. I have told you this repeatedly.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sigh, you refuse again. Well, I suppose I wouldn’t want to exchange
            such beings for money either…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the repeated explanations, Viscount Damon still didn’t
            understand and thought Repenhardt was just being reluctant to part
            with valuable assets. Ending the conversation with him in the nicest
            way possible, Repenhardt heaved a deep sigh.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ugh, I’d like to shut his mouth with a punch, but I can’t do that.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, Repenhardt was busy meeting with Yubel’s nobles. Having
            showcased the power of the different races, the next step was to
            strengthen relations with the humans to minimize any future
            betrayals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the nobles had attitudes similar to that of Viscount Damon.
            Although they praised Repenhardt’s skills, few genuinely
            acknowledged the different races. Some, upon hearing they were free,
            interpreted it as ‘wild’ and secretly attempted to capture and tame
            the warriors of the Dahnhaim tribe and the Blue Bear tribe. Of
            course, Repenhardt had anticipated this and prepared in advance, so
            these attempts ended with the nobles getting beaten up.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there were some nobles who sensed that something was
            different.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the corridors of Sinai Fortress, two middle-aged men were
            walking together amiably. They were Baron Haron and Baron Galin.
            These two were merchant-turned-nobles from the Feonin family, and
            unlike the others, they were among the more enlightened ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If he can interact with them, there’s no reason we can’t, is
            there?”
          </p>
          <p>“But what kind of interaction can we have with mere slaves…”</p>
          <p>
            “Even with the same material, a coarse item can be a chamber pot,
            while a masterpiece crafted by a skilled artisan can be a priceless
            porcelain.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s true. I still can’t fully accept that slave races can be
            like that, but we can’t ignore the reality before us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “For now, let’s observe a bit more. Anyway, the power they
            demonstrated is undeniably real.”
          </p>
          <p>“Agreed.”</p>
          <p>
            With that, the two men, reserving their judgment, headed to their
            quarters. As their footsteps faded down the corridor, a massive
            shadow emerged from the darkness on the opposite side. It was
            Repenhardt, who had been using detection magic to gauge the
            reactions of the nobles.
          </p>
          <p>
            “At least, it wasn’t all in vain. Thankfully, there are some who
            understand.”
          </p>
          <p>The war had just begun.</p>
          <p>The exploits of the different races were only starting.</p>
          <p>
            From now on, humans would fight shoulder to shoulder with them.
            Together, they would wield their swords as comrades.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If that happens, my dream will come one step closer to reality.”

          <p>[ Chapter 129 ]</p>
          <p>
            The capital city of Crotaine was enveloped in a chaotic atmosphere.
            This turmoil stemmed from the news that Sinai Fortress, the
            steadfast shield defending the capital, had fallen. Both the
            citizens engaged in their daily lives and the soldiers guarding the
            capital were all abuzz with fear and rumors.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I can’t believe it. Wasn’t Sir Tetsvalt an Aura User renowned
            across the continent?”
          </p>
          <p>“And yet they say it was a dwarf who killed Sir Tetsvalt?”</p>
          <p>“That’s utter nonsense!”</p>
          <p>“But hasn’t Sinai Fortress actually fallen?”</p>
          <p>
            Most of the capital’s citizens supported Prince Carsus. Being a
            famous knight with a brilliant mind and known for his fair and
            impartial attitude, Prince Carsus was far more popular than the
            libertine Prince Yubel. Every evening, worried voices filled the
            taverns around the capital as people discussed the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Could it be true? That those orc-like creatures are so terrifying?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know, aren’t the orcs who participate in gladiator fights
            quite violent?”
          </p>
          <p>“But still….”</p>
          <p>
            The men drinking and talking in the tavern hall suddenly looked to
            their side. A clumsy-looking orc was passing by them, carrying a
            pile of firewood. It was an old orc slave owned by the tavern.
            Having become useless after working on a farm and growing old, it
            had been sold cheaply as a menial laborer.
          </p>
          <p>“Master. I chopped the wood. Brought it.”</p>
          <p>
            The orc slave spoke in a clumsy voice towards the counter. Soon, a
            stout woman appeared, pointing her finger and shouting irritably.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Then you should immediately take it to the backyard! Stupid thing!”
          </p>
          <p>“Understood. Kaltu. Going to backyard. Taking the wood.”</p>
          <p>
            Even as he was being scolded, the orc merely shuffled along,
            following orders. The men shook their heads at this sight.
          </p>
          <p>“See, that is what an orc is.”</p>
          <p>“Surely it’s just a false rumor, right?”</p>
          <p>“Of course.”</p>
          <p>
            They dismissed it as a mere rumor and continued drinking. However,
            their expressions remained somber. No matter how much it was
            considered hearsay, the fall of Sinai Fortress and the defeat of
            three thousand soldiers was an undeniable truth. Prince Yubel’s army
            would soon launch a counterattack, which meant the capital would
            become a battlefield. There was no way to enjoy the drink.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Who in the world would have orchestrated such a thing using the
            orcs?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, I heard something about it. It’s said to be Count Piterran’s
            army.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, the one that was supposedly annihilated by the dwarves….”</p>
          <p>
            “Shh! The honor of the noble families is at stake, we shouldn’t
            speak too loudly about it!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The man who brought it up hushed the others and lowered his voice.
            The others, too, hunched their shoulders and waited for him to
            continue.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I heard there is a priest of Philanence who commands those dwarves.
            Someone mentioned seeing him directing them with a mere flick of his
            fingers.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Huh? Aren’t priests usually reluctant to use slaves because of
            their reputation?”
          </p>
          <p>“Exactly, which makes it even stranger.”</p>
          <p>
            It was at that moment that a woman’s voice interrupted their
            conversation.
          </p>
          <p>“Could you tell me more about that story?”</p>
          <p>
            The voice belonged to a slender beauty who appeared to be in her
            mid-twenties. Dressed as a traveler, she held a bronze wine cup in
            one hand, suggesting she had been drinking. She had approached the
            men’s table and was now looking down at them. With her perfect
            eight-head proportion, alluring face, and extraordinary beauty, she
            would have been considered a stunning beauty by any man.
          </p>
          <p>However, the men she approached were visibly taken aback.</p>
          <p>‘What the—?’</p>
          <p>‘Who is this woman?’</p>
          <p>
            She was undeniably a beauty. In a portrait, she would be praised as
            a peerless beauty by anyone who saw it. But there was a problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman was nearly two meters tall. From the seated men’s
            perspective, her beautiful face was so high up that they had to tilt
            their heads back to see her.
          </p>
          <p>‘Why is this woman so tall?’</p>
          <p>
            ‘Did she inherit the bloodline of a legendary giant or something?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Under normal circumstances, encountering such a beautiful woman
            might encourage them to try striking up a conversation, especially
            after a few drinks. But her height was so overwhelming that they
            couldn’t muster the courage. One of the men, looking intimidated,
            asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Wh-what do you want?”</p>
          <p>
            “It’s about the priestess of Philanence you were just talking about.
            Have you heard anything else?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Her tone was polite but somehow commanding. Her demeanor was so
            natural that the men instinctively responded respectfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, yes. I haven’t heard much. Just that the priestess who commands
            the orcs is from Philanence… and he’s a very young girl, about
            fourteen years old? They say he has extremely long red hair and is
            so pretty that he looks like a beautiful girl.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman’s eyes flashed with a terrifying intensity. The men
            shivered involuntarily, taken aback by her predatory look.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like a beast that had found its prey, the woman burst into laughter.
          </p>
          <p>“Hohohoho!”</p>
          <p>Crunch!</p>
          <p>The bronze cup in her hand crumpled effortlessly!</p>
          <p>
            The men were struck with fear. To crumple a bronze cup with just her
            grip? What kind of unbalanced beauty was this?
          </p>
          <p>
            But the woman seemed uninterested in answering their questions. She
            turned and headed towards the exit of the tavern. As she pushed the
            door open, she muttered in a low voice,

          <p>“I’ve finally found you. Sillan Phil Marcis, my betrothed!”</p>

          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Prince Yubel’s army, having captured Sinai Fortress, immediately
            advanced towards the capital, Krotin. The terrain between Sinai
            Fortress and Krotin was a vast plain with no natural obstacles,
            which is why Sinai Fortress was known as the gateway to the capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although there were small garrisons along the way, most surrendered
            immediately when faced with an advancing force of three thousand
            soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some loyal to Carsus attempted to resist, leading to occasional
            skirmishes, but they were no match for Prince Yubel’s numerically
            superior army. It was a rapid and overwhelming advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The strategy of Prince Yubel’s army was a blitzkrieg, aiming to
            reclaim the capital while the enemy’s forces were scattered.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Carsus was no easy opponent. With swift responses and the
            use of magic for information dissemination, Carsus managed to gather
            all his forces in Krotin within just five days. Remarkably, his
            forces assembled even faster than those who had already started
            marching. Even Repenhardt could not help but be impressed by the
            speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            ”This means he assessed the situation immediately upon hearing of
            the fortress’s fall, right? And his vassals packed up and moved
            right away too? Impressive. His strategic capability, popularity,
            and the training of his soldiers… there’s nothing to criticize.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that the news of Sinai Fortress’s fall reached them so
            quickly and that they could immediately mobilize their army
            indicated that Carsus had a well-established communication and
            command system. Carsus excelled not only in strategy and bravery but
            also in administrative capabilities. Although an enemy, he was
            undoubtedly a person worthy of respect.
          </p>
          <p>‘Truly a future wise king.’</p>
          <p>
            In contrast, Prince Yubel’s army, despite advocating for a
            blitzkrieg, had been delayed at Sinai Fortress for two days. The
            rushed march had left them unable to properly organize their forces,
            and some who distrusted Repenhardt opposed the hasty advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite capturing the fortress, they argued that they should spend
            more time gathering troops, citing the persistent numerical
            disadvantage.
          </p>
          <p>To Repenhardt, this was an absurd stance.</p>
          <p>
            ‘We’ve gained the upper hand and have the enemy at our mercy, but
            now they suggest waiting for reinforcements because the enemy’s neck
            might be tougher than expected?’
          </p>
          <p>
            The combined effect of Carsus’s competence and the ineptitude of
            Yubel’s faction led to Carsus’s forces arriving in the capital two
            days ahead of Prince Yubel’s army. Carsus allowed his troops a day
            of rest, then the next day led an army of ten thousand out of the
            capital.
          </p>
          <p>And one day later…</p>
          <p>
            On the vast plain of Redanti, between the forests in the center of
            Crovence, the two armies faced each other at a distance. It was the
            ten thousand strong army of Carsus against the slightly over three
            thousand soldiers of Prince Yubel. The blitzkrieg had ultimately
            failed, and now the two sides were poised for a direct confrontation
            of strength.
          </p>
          <p>”Well, it’s not all bad for us.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, surveying both camps from horseback, shrugged. Although
            the failure to retake the capital before the enemy forces combined
            had caused Yubel’s strategists to lament, a direct confrontation was
            actually better for demonstrating the power of their allied
            non-human forces.
          </p>
          <p>Beside him, Siris frowned slightly.</p>
          <p>”But wouldn’t this lead to heavy casualties on our side?”</p>
          <p>
            She wore light battle attire and was armed with a scimitar, also
            mounted on a horse. Repenhardt shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>”Considering their capabilities, it’s better this way.”</p>
          <p>
            The initial plan of Prince Yubel’s army had been to retake the
            capital Krotin before the enemy forces could regroup and then hold a
            defensive position against reinforcements.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this strategy was only viable under the assumption that
            they could indeed recapture the capital. If the reinforcements
            arrived during a siege, they would be attacked from both the front
            and rear.
          </p>
          <p>
            And given what they had seen, it was unlikely that Carsus, with his
            abilities, would easily surrender the capital.
          </p>
          <p>”In fact, our delay worked out in our favor.”</p>

          <p>
            Once all his forces had gathered at the capital, Carsus had
            confidently led his army out into the open field. As a future king,
            he needed to consider public opinion. Turning the capital Krotin
            into a battlefield carried significant risks, making his decision a
            logical one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, no competent commander would opt for a defensive battle
            when their forces outnumbered the enemy three to one.
          </p>
          <p>”Then, I’ll get going.”</p>
          <p>”Alright, be careful!”</p>
          <p>”Yes!”</p>
          <p>
            With a slight smile, Siris urged her horse towards the other side of
            the camp to join the elven warriors of the Dahnhaim tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s group was currently scattered. Tilla was with the dwarf
            warriors of Grand Forge, Tassid was in the Blue Bear tribe’s camp,
            Sillan was among the clerics of Redanti within the healing corps,
            and Russ was with Prince Yubel’s royal guard preparing for battle.
          </p>
          <p>”I hope everyone stays safe…”</p>
          <p>
            Despite his confidence in their abilities, Repenhardt couldn’t help
            but worry about his cherished companions as they faced the impending
            battle. As his voice trailed off, a loud, boisterous shout erupted
            right next to him.
          </p>
          <p>”My lord, I pledge my life to protect you!”</p>
          <p>
            It was Talcata, the orc gladiator. He wore the plundered armor of
            the Fernando knights and stood by Repenhardt’s side as his
            bodyguard, his face still burning with loyalty.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt glanced at him and nodded weakly.</p>
          <p>”Sure, go ahead.”</p>
          <p>
            In truth, he had wanted to send Talcata to the Blue Bear tribe with
            Tassid, hoping he could learn a thing or two from them.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Stalla had refused. The warriors of the Blue Bear tribe fought
            together as one for a long time, and even though Talcata was also an
            orc, his lack of skill and synchronization meant he couldn’t be
            integrated into their ranks.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Instead, leave him with me for about half a year after this. I’ll
            train him to be an excellent orc! I raised Tassid too, you know?
            Hohoho!
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s expression had been one of excitement, and Tassid, standing
            beside her, had looked alarmed, making it clear that her ‘training’
            would be rigorous and ‘orc-like.’ Repenhardt felt a pang of sympathy
            as he looked at Talcata.
          </p>
          <p>”I’m sorry. It’s all for your own good.”</p>
          <p>”My lord? Why are you looking at me like that…?”</p>
          <p>”Oh, nothing. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
          <p>
            Feeling a twinge of guilt, Repenhardt turned his gaze back to the
            camp.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the disparity in numbers—ten thousand versus three
            thousand—the morale of the two armies wasn’t as different as he had
            feared.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Carsus army was well-trained and had great trust in their
            commander, and their numerical superiority naturally boosted their
            morale.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Prince Yubel’s army wasn’t significantly demoralized
            either. Though nervous faces were evident at the sight of an army
            three times their size, they had five Aura Users among them and a
            formidable battalion that had taken a fortress of three thousand
            with just two hundred men.
          </p>
          <p>”In the end, the rest is up to fate.”</p>
          <p>He had done his best. Repenhardt looked up at the sky.</p>
          <p>
            ”All that remains is to hope for victory. Well, if it gets too
            desperate, I’ll have to jump in myself…”
          </p>
          <p>Given his past experiences, he hoped it wouldn’t come to that.</p>
          <p>
            Standard-bearers at the front of both armies waved their flags,
            signaling the preparation for battle. The camps aligned, and the
            vast plain filled with an atmosphere charged with anticipation.
          </p>
          <p>Buuuuung!</p>
          <p>
            The war horns sounded from both sides, marking the beginning of the
            decisive battle for the throne of Crovence.

          <p>[ Chapter 130 ]</p>
          <p>
            The forces of Carsus and Prince Yubel were both arrayed in
            formations that deviated from conventional battlefield strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Carsus army had formed a strong defensive formation with tightly
            packed troops and positioned their knights at the forefront, aiming
            for a central breakthrough. While not necessarily a poor formation,
            this was typically a strategy employed by a smaller force facing a
            larger army.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, Prince Yubel’s forces had stretched their formation
            thin and wide, creating an encircling shape with arms extended. This
            was usually a formation used when attempting to overwhelm the enemy
            with superior numbers.
          </p>
          <p>In essence, the formations of both sides were reversed.</p>
          <p>
            “Of course, if you understand the circumstances, it’s quite
            reasonable,” Repenhardt remarked, stroking his chin.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason Prince Yubel’s army, despite its smaller numbers, adopted
            an encircling formation was simple. It wasn’t actually an encircling
            formation but rather multiple assault units. With six Aura Users
            among their ranks, there was no need to concentrate their powerful
            force in one spot.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, the knights who had lost the honor to Repenhardt vied
            to be at the forefront this time. Thus, the decision was made to let
            them all lead the charge. Knights are most useful on the battlefield
            when they are charging at the front, so relegating them to the rear
            was not an option.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Carsus was wary of the combat prowess of Prince Yubel’s
            forces, who had managed to capture Sinai Fortress with only two
            hundred men. Although he was reluctant to acknowledge the prowess of
            a slave race, the fact remained that Sinai Fortress had fallen to
            those two hundred men. He wasn’t foolish enough to ignore the
            reality before his eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            In terms of ‘knight-level’ strength, Prince Yubel’s forces were
            actually superior to Carsus’s. Despite this seemingly illogical
            scenario, Carsus’s keen intellect grasped the situation. Thus,
            adopting a defensive formation was the rational choice.
          </p>
          <p>Buuuuuuung!</p>
          <p>
            As the horn sounded, both sides erupted in cheers. Amidst the
            booming voices that elevated their morale, a knight on horseback
            slowly advanced from the Carsus formation. He was a middle-aged man
            in his early forties, with light red hair and a magnificent beard.
          </p>
          <p>Cheers erupted from the Carsus army.</p>
          <p>“The Demon Sword of Brozen!”</p>
          <p>“Sir Spirius!”</p>
          <p>
            Raven von Spirius, a knight serving the Marquess of Brozen, was
            another Aura User within the Carsus army. Having awakened his Aura
            at the age of forty, and training diligently for three years, he was
            a relatively new Aura User but possessed formidable combat prowess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Spirius drew his sword. Displaying a brilliant red Blade Aura,
            he proudly showcased his power as he shouted.

            Spirius, challenge you! If there is a warrior among you, step
            forward!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The cheers of the Carsus army grew louder. The radiant sword of the
            Aura User was indeed effective in boosting the soldiers’ morale.
            Just the sight of such valor was enough to elevate spirits and make
            hearts race with excitement.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is there no warrior among you? It seems it was certainly a cowardly
            trick that defeated Sir Tetsvalt!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kadamyte, who had been waiting, frowned as he watched Sir Spirius
            shouting.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Shall I go out there and cut him down? Just by looking at him, he’s
            weaker than that Tetsvalt fellow.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, we already know who’s going out, don’t we?”</p>
          <p>
            The Dwarf warrior standing beside him stopped him. As expected, a
            man rode out from the camp. Sir Spirius’s expression twisted
            slightly. He had heard rumors that Sir Tetsvalt had been killed by a
            Dwarf Aura User. But the man now emerging was clearly a human.
          </p>
          <p>“Who are you?”</p>
          <p>The man drew a long sword and shouted boldly.</p>
          <p>
            “I am Cyrus of the Tenes family, an ally of Prince Yubel. It is an
            honor to face the renowned Sir Spirius!”
          </p>
          <p>Wooooom!</p>
          <p>
            With a roar, a blue Blade Aura erupted from Russ’s sword. This time,
            it was Prince Yubel’s army that cheered. Spirius muttered in
            disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>“Incredible. He doesn’t even look thirty.”</p>
          <p>
            Considering the common knowledge of the present age that even the
            most exceptional warriors only awaken to Aura in their late
            thirties, Russ’s existence was indeed astonishing.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I commend your martial prowess! Now, I shall present your head to
            Lord Carsus!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Spirius began to charge on his horse. Russ also rode forward,
            shouting.
          </p>
          <p>“It will not be easy!”</p>
          <p>
            Red and blue lights collided at the center of the battlefield,
            causing an explosion.
          </p>

          <p>KABOOOM!</p>
          <p>
            At first glance, it might seem meaningless for renowned warriors to
            settle their skills one-on-one before a battle. However, any proper
            strategist knew how significant this act was in determining the
            soldiers’ morale.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the perspective of a commander, troop movements might be
            visible, but for an ordinary soldier, war was merely about wildly
            following orders, risking death if unlucky, and surviving if
            fortunate. To help these soldiers overcome the fear of death and
            boost their combat spirit, it was necessary to show them directly,
            ‘Look! Our side is this strong! Fight with confidence!’
          </p>
          <p>“Taaaah!”</p>
          <p>“Haaap!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ and Spirius continuously clashed their Blade Auras, leaving
            dazzling trails in the air. Each time their auras collided, sending
            shockwaves, the soldiers erupted in cheers. The cheers from Prince
            Yubel’s army were louder than those from the Carsus army.
          </p>
          <p>“Aura User!”</p>
          <p>“We have an Aura User too now!”</p>
          <p>“But who is that knight? He looks human.”</p>
          <p>“They say it’s Cyrus! Does it matter? He’s on our side!”</p>
          <p>
            Since the civil war began, Prince Yubel’s army had always ignored
            the Carsus army’s provocations for one-on-one duels, immediately
            engaging in battle instead. Only an Aura User could face another
            Aura User, and it was always Tetsvalt or Spirius who issued the
            challenges. Knowing that they would surely lose if they accepted,
            Prince Yubel’s army couldn’t afford to take up the challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, Prince Yubel’s troops always entered battle with lower
            morale compared to the Carsus army. The mere fact that they avoided
            these duels made the soldiers feel inferior. This sometimes led to
            the unfortunate situation where Prince Yubel’s army, despite having
            the upper hand, would lose due to lower morale.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now it was different. Russ was holding his own against Sir
            Spirius with remarkable skill. Just having an Aura User to step up
            for a one-on-one duel sent Prince Yubel’s army’s morale soaring.
            Conversely, learning that their opponents had an additional Aura
            User dampened the Carsus army’s spirits.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sir Spirius, you must win this,” Carsus muttered, watching the duel
            from the main camp while biting his nails.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was anxious. He had heard that two Orcs and three Dwarf Aura
            Users had taken down the Sinai Fortress. Now, there was an
            unexpected human Aura User in the mix.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Do they mass-produce Aura Users or what? Why do they keep popping
            up?’
          </p>
          <p>
            If the information was correct, the number of Aura Users on their
            side now exceeded that of the entire Crovence Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It seems unlikely, but with such rumors circulating, Sir Spirius
            must defeat that young knight impressively.’
          </p>
          <p>An adjutant beside him spoke cautiously.</p>
          <p>
            “Do not worry too much, sir. Awakening Aura at such a young age is
            impressive, but he does not look to be even thirty. In terms of
            experience and skill, Sir Spirius cannot possibly lose.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s true,” Carsus nodded. Yet he couldn’t shake the sense of
            unease that filled his heart.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            A sharp trajectory of red Blade Aura rushed towards a vital point,
            only to be deflected by a dazzling circle of blue Blade Aura. Light
            clashed with light, creating a splendid dance in the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spirius’s expression hardened as he observed Russ, who countered his
            mounted swordsmanship with equal skill.
          </p>
          <p>“You have impressive skills for a young warrior!”</p>

          <p>“You too live up to your renowned reputation!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ responded with a shout, hiding a smile. With each clash of
            their swords, exhilaration surged through him.
          </p>
          <p>‘I can do this!’</p>
          <p>
            He could indeed. He could hold his own and potentially even defeat
            Sir Spirius, the famed Aura User of Crovence. The realization
            brought him incredible satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Spirius’s swordsmanship was undoubtedly superior to Russ’s. Russ’s
            unique, unpredictable style was not enough to penetrate Spirius’s
            mastery of orthodox swordsmanship. In terms of pure swordsmanship,
            Russ would surely lose.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this, Russ was fighting Spirius on equal terms. Ironically,
            Russ had more ‘experience’ than Spirius.
          </p>
          <p>‘I must thank hyung for this.’</p>
          <p>
            Spirius had roamed the continent as a young knight, surviving
            numerous deadly battles. However, after becoming an Aura User, he
            had never faced a true life-or-death struggle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Crovence Kingdom had enjoyed peace for the past decade, with no
            wars against other nations. As one of the most prominent noble
            families, the Marquisate of Brozen faced no significant threats,
            leaving Spirius without serious challenges. At best, he demonstrated
            his overwhelming prowess by scattering Aura against bandits and
            thieves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, Aura Users rarely sparred with each other to avoid
            revealing their techniques. Tetsvalt was considered the strongest
            knight in Crovence not because he had defeated all other Aura Users
            in combat, but because he had trained the longest and his Aura
            manifestation was the most intense. Aura Users could generally gauge
            each other’s level by sensing their Aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, Russ had encountered numerous Aura Users, including
            Repenhardt, Dwarves, and Orcs. In terms of fighting Aura Users, the
            young Russ, who had only recently awakened his Aura, had more
            practical experience than the forty-year-old Spirius, who had spent
            a lifetime mastering swordsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ll kill you!”</p>
          <p>“You impudent brat!”</p>
          <p>
            Spirius roared, his red Aura flaring as he charged. Russ, unfazed,
            met the attack head-on, his blue Aura blazing. The battlefield
            crackled with energy as the two warriors clashed, the outcome
            uncertain but the spectacle undeniable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shouting fiercely, the two knights continued their exchange of
            attacks. Unlike ordinary knights, who might rely on weapons like
            spears or shields, they only wielded long swords.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with Aura capable of changing form at will, such
            conventional weapons were rendered meaningless. Each extended,
            fired, blocked, and redirected their red and blue Blade Auras in a
            ferocious battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Spirius had the upper hand in swordsmanship, their Aura
            reserves were evenly matched, and Russ’s proficiency and experience
            in utilizing Aura were superior. The battle gradually tilted in
            Russ’s favor.
          </p>
          <p>Seeing this, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Well, I sent him out there thinking it wouldn’t matter if he lost.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Having missed the battle at Sinai Fortress, Russ had pestered
            Repenhardt for the chance to face Sir Spirius this time. Russ’s
            loyalty to Repenhardt was driven by his ambition to make a name for
            himself and return to the Tenes family with honor, a reasonable
            request.
          </p>
          <p>
            This time, Repenhardt had readily agreed. At Sinai Fortress, the aim
            had been to prove the true strength of the other races, but that
            wasn’t necessary now.
          </p>
          <p>
            Proving the strength of other races was good, but if they continued
            to outshine the humans, it would overshadow the humans’
            achievements.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would create a dichotomy of humans versus other races rather
            than allies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given that most of Prince Yubel’s army were humans, having a human
            Aura User step up was crucial to preserving the dignity of other
            nobles and preventing unnecessary jealousy and rivalry.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If it looks like humans are being overshadowed by Dwarves or Orcs,
            it could give the wrong impression. But if Russ steps up, they’ll
            see us as a formidable, diverse group of Aura Users. If Russ falls,
            then Kalken or Kadamyte can step in.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had his reasons for sending Russ out. He hadn’t expected
            Russ to win, as, based on his past life, Russ had little chance of
            defeating Sir Spirius at his current age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, Russ was fighting remarkably well, far exceeding expectations.
            He was nearly dominating the situation.
          </p>
          <p>‘At this rate, he’ll be called a Sword Saint in a few years.’</p>
          <p>
            But on reflection, it wasn’t so surprising. Russ’s talent was
            extraordinary, nearly complete in itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had only earned the title of Sword Saint in his forties because
            Aura Users typically avoided sparring, forcing him to learn
            everything on his own, which took time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, thanks to Repenhardt, he had the opportunity to learn from
            various sources, making his rapid progress unsurprising.
