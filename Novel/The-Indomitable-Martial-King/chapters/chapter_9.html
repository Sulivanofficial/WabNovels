          <p>[Chapter 81]</p>
          <p>Russ chuckled dryly.</p>
          <p>“Ah, no wonder…”</p>
          <p>
            Building a city of this scale from scratch would require an enormous
            number of workers. However, driving out whatever was inside and
            remodeling it could be achieved with relatively few hands. Even the
            slave race of dwarves might manage it, given their fine
            craftsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>It was then that Repenhardt corrected his misconception.</p>
          <p>
            “But it’s clear that this was a city of dwarves even in the Silver
            Age.”
          </p>
          <p>“How can you be so sure, brother?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt pointed to the buildings along the road.</p>
          <p>“Notice the low thresholds.”</p>
          <p>
            Russ understood immediately. It wasn’t just about low thresholds—low
            ceilings, overly short stairs, and low handrails too. Everything
            indicated it wasn’t built for humans. Furthermore, the dwarf statues
            and sculptures scattered throughout the city undeniably proved it
            was a dwarven city.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, in the Silver Age, dwarves were prosperous enough to have their
            own cities. A race born to be slaves couldn’t have done that,
            right?”
          </p>
          <p>“Umm…”</p>
          <p>
            Russ grunted, dodging a direct response. Repenhardt’s reasoning
            sounded convincing, but changing deep-rooted perceptions was not
            easy.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a long walk, they arrived in the residential area, and Pulbart
            led the group to a house. A middle-aged dwarf woman came out to
            greet them. After a brief exchange, Pulbart told the group,
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s stay here for now. I will prepare some food.”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone entered with awkward expressions. The house Pulbart had
            chosen was relatively large compared to nearby dwellings, but it was
            still built to dwarf standards. Russ smirked as he entered.
          </p>
          <p>‘It feels like crawling into a doghole.’</p>
          <p>
            For Repenhardt, standing 192 centimeters tall, or Russ at 180
            centimeters, it was needless to say, and even Siris, an elf who was
            still a girl but already over 170 centimeters tall, had to bend her
            back to get through the doorway.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ah, and of course, Sillan followed in dejectedly, fully upright.
          </p>
          <p>“I… I wish I could bend my back too…”</p>
          <p>
            Tilla giggled as she followed Sillan. They started unpacking their
            belongings here and there until Pulbart apologized with a look of
            regret.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve contacted the high priest now. It’s humble fare, but please
            have something to eat while you wait.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Given the constant attacks by monsters, it had been a long time
            since the party had enjoyed a decent hot meal. With expectations
            rising, the middle-aged dwarf woman approached, carrying a large
            tray.
          </p>

          <p>
            The meal consisted of a soup made with turnips and potatoes and a
            mysterious type of boiled meat. While the food seemed overly modest
            to offer to a group known as saviors of their clan, considering that
            the dwarves lived hidden in the most remote of places, it was
            clearly prepared with great care. Everyone gratefully picked up
            their spoons.
          </p>
          <p>Taking a bite of the boiled meat, Sillan suddenly asked,</p>
          <p>“What kind of meat is this?”</p>
          <p>
            It was oddly tough and had a gamey smell. It wasn’t inedible, but it
            certainly wasn’t delicious. Pulbart proudly replied,
          </p>
          <p>“It’s boiled basilisk liver.”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone’s expressions hardened. Basilisk? They were eating the
            innards of that monster?
          </p>
          <p>
            Instantly, both Sillan and Russ seemed to lose their appetites,
            their faces dropping. Siris, who had been eagerly using her fork,
            subtly tried to push her plate away.
          </p>
          <p>“Eh, elves primarily eat vegetables, haha.”</p>
          <p>“You were munching on jerky just yesterday… Ouch!”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan pouted after being pinched in the side by Repenhardt. Having
            eaten all sorts of dreadful foods under Gerard, Repenhardt continued
            to chew the meat nonchalantly.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s edible. What’s everyone’s problem?”</p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the taste, the idea of eating monster meat was hardly
            appealing. As everyone made uncomfortable faces, Pulbart looked
            slightly disappointed,
          </p>
          <p>
            “It might not taste the best, but it’s quite a rare delicacy. It’s
            good for your health.”
          </p>
          <p>“Good for what?”</p>
          <p>“Um…”</p>
          <p>Pulbart stroked his beard with a meaningful smile.</p>
          <p>
            “Well… it’s particularly beneficial for men… though I can’t quite
            explain how…”
          </p>
          <p>“Wow!”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Russ and Sillan’s eyes gleamed. Whether human or dwarf, no man could
            resist! Overcoming racial boundaries, they both eagerly started
            devouring the basilisk liver. Tilla and Siris pouted their lips.
          </p>
          <p>“Typical men,” muttered Siris.</p>
          <p>“Beasts,” added Tilla.</p>
          <p>“I expected it from Mr. Russ, but not Sillan,” she commented.</p>
          <p>
            “I’ll soon have a muscular physique too, so I need to prepare in
            advance,” Sillan declared.
          </p>

          <p>
            What exactly he needed to prepare for was unclear, but being
            well-prepared surely couldn’t hurt?
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to them, the mood quickly warmed. Even Russ, who held
            stereotypes, thought, ‘Dwarves, better fellows than I expected!’
            Thus, the pleasant(?) meal concluded, and a young dwarf entered from
            outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mr. Pulbart, the high priest commands that the Savior be escorted
            to the Central Tower.”
          </p>
          <p>As if he had been waiting, Repenhardt stood up.</p>
          <p>“Then I’ll head out. Rest here, everyone.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            At the heart of the Grand Forge, a massive tower, connected to the
            ceiling like stalactites, was where Makelin, the high priest of Al
            Port, resided. As the young dwarf led them to the base of the tower,
            he bowed his head.
          </p>
          <p>“Then you can go up these stairs.”</p>
          <p>Looking up at the tower, Repenhardt nodded as if he understood,</p>
          <p>
            “It seems no one else can enter from here. Well, it’s a kind of
            sanctuary if it’s where the high priest resides…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, it’s just that it’s a hassle to go up,” the dwarf retorted
            dryly.
          </p>
          <p>“…”</p>
          <p>
            Remembering the nature of dwarves, Repenhardt let out a hollow laugh
            before ascending the stairs. Upon reaching the top, he found himself
            in a space surrounded by brown walls. The walls and pillars were
            carved with all sorts of images, and in the center, a large altar
            adorned with gold and bronze was placed.
          </p>
          <p>An elderly dwarf greeted Repenhardt in front of the altar.</p>
          <p>“Welcome, O Savior ordained by the oracle.”</p>
          <p>
            The dwarf was truly enveloped in his white hair and long beard and
            eyebrows. Repenhardt’s eyes momentarily reddened.
          </p>
          <p>‘Makelin…’</p>
          <p>
            His most loyal subordinate, his most trustworthy friend, and at
            times, a respected and relied upon teacher.
          </p>
          <p>
            His appearance had not changed in the slightest despite the barrier
            of 30 years. Unlike Siris or Tassid, Makelin had already been of old
            age for a dwarf when he first met Repenhardt in a previous life.
            Considering that 30 years for a human was only about 7 or 8 years
            for a dwarf, it made sense that Makelin’s appearance had not
            changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Overwhelmed by the memory of him, Repenhardt almost blurted out,
            ‘Wow, Makelin! It’s been so long!’ He swallowed the words before
            they escaped his lips and composed himself. He then replied
            formally.
          </p>
          <p>“It has been a long time, high priest of Al Port, Makelin.”</p>
          <p>Makelin looked at Repenhardt with a curious expression.</p>
          <p>
            “Those words you speak are true, O Savior. But it is strange. Have
            we met before?”
          </p>

          <p>He then tilted his head in thought, muttering to himself,</p>
          <p>“No, that cannot be. I have not left this place in 50 years.”</p>
          <p>
            The young savior before him did not look a day over thirty (in fact,
            he was in his early twenties). Logically, it was incomprehensible.
          </p>
          <p>With a knowing look, Repenhardt nodded.</p>
          <p>“I know you, but you do not know me.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt spoke earnestly, knowing that while others might not
            believe him, Makelin, the high priest who could hear the voice of
            truth, would trust him.
          </p>
          <p>“It will be hard to understand. I met you ten years from now.”</p>
          <p>
            Makelin looked at him with a perplexed expression. It was clear that
            Repenhardt was speaking the truth, yet his words made no logical
            sense. Usually, there was only one explanation for such a scenario.
          </p>
          <p>‘…Could the Savior be mentally ill?’</p>
          <p>
            But that seemed unlikely. While it’s true that mental illness isn’t
            always immediately obvious, it seemed improbable that Al Port, the
            god of the dwarves, would choose someone mentally unstable as the
            savior of his people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Addressing the bewildered Makelin, Repenhardt calmly said, “I am one
            who has traveled back in time.”
          </p>
          <p>He told him everything.</p>
          <p>
            The tales of his wanderings across the continent as a great
            sorcerer, his efforts to ascend to the 10th circle of magic by
            seeking the secrets of different races and building alliances with
            them, how he aided them at every turn and increasingly clashed with
            human forces to protect these races, and how he eventually
            established the Antares Empire, becoming known as the Demon King and
            waging war against the entire continent until his demise.
          </p>
          <p>
            He shared who he lived as, whom he met, how he died, and how he was
            resurrected and came to be here.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know it’s hard to believe. But I have indeed spoken the truth,
            and whether you believe it or not is up to you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing his explanation, Repenhardt smiled wryly,
            straightened his back, and leaned against the chair. Makelin, who
            had listened intently to every word, slowly shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even for a dwarf who can hear the voice of truth, this is indeed a
            hard story to believe.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The dwarves indeed hear the voice of truth, yet that does not
            guarantee they can discern it fully. If the person speaking believes
            their words to be true, even if they are false, it still sounds like
            truth to the dwarves’ ears.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I too would have considered you mad, had it not been for Lord Al
            Fort’s oracle. However, your words seem quite plausible,” said a
            voice suddenly.
          </p>
          <p>Makelin’s eyes lit up.</p>
          <p>
            “May I test you? I wish to know whether you are a lunatic or a sage
            transcending time.”
          </p>
          <p>“A test?”</p>
          <p>
            His curiosity was piqued. Repenhardt nodded. Makelin pondered for a
            moment before speaking again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Had I been one of the Four Heavenly Kings under your command, and
            close to you as I was, I certainly would have mentioned this
            characteristic of mine. So I ask you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Stroking his dazzlingly white beard, Makelin asked meaningfully,
            “What color is my beard?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Asking the color of a beard that is visibly white would typically
            suggest a trap. It was likely not as white as it appeared. Makelin
            watched Repenhardt closely. What would this young man respond?
          </p>
          <p>But the answer came promptly as if he had been waiting.</p>
          <p>
            “There can’t be a color if there’s no beard, can there? Makelin, you
            were still wearing that thing 30 years later. Your condition hasn’t
            changed.”
          </p>
          <p>“……That’s sad.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 82 ]</p>
          <p>
            Makelin stroked his beard in distress, when suddenly, his lush beard
            fell off his chin, revealing the face of a rather stately old man.
            Indeed, Makelin’s beard, which suited the grandeur of a dwarven
            Grand Priest, was fake.
          </p>
          <p>“Do you know the story behind this beard?” he asked.</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt gave a wry smile as he responded, “I’ve heard it’s a
            blessing from Al Port.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Among dwarf men, a lush beard was a symbol of masculinity. Baldness
            might be acceptable, but a clean-shaven chin was despised and
            considered repulsive by all dwarf women. Sadly, Makelin had been
            afflicted with a peculiar condition since his youth, which prevented
            him from growing a beard.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he had been a human, he might have resorted to a fake beard.
            However, among dwarves, who could see through such deceits, wigs or
            false hair held no value and only made one look more pitiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, Makelin was an extraordinary talent among dwarves. With
            his incredible divine power and leadership, he had the honor of
            being chosen as the Grand Priest of Al Port after 200 years. And it
            was then that Al Port, the dwarven god, bestowed upon his earthly
            representative this magnificent fake beard.
          </p>
          <p>
            A divine beard that even the Eyes of Truth could not penetrate! To
            humans, it might seem like an unnecessary act by Al Port, but among
            dwarves, the story was entirely different. This beard was clear
            proof of Makelin’s genuine favor with Al Port! With it, Makelin
            earned the respect and awe of all dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even we dwarves cannot discern the true nature of this beard;
            surely, a human like you would not have known, which assures me that
            your words are true,” Makelin affirmed, reattaching the beard. If
            Repenhardt were a madman, believing his own delusions to be real, he
            wouldn’t have known this information. Indeed, the young human before
            him had truly traveled through time.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The reason I originally sought you out was to offer some advice
            about your destiny as a savior and your path forward. But you
            already know everything there is to know about being a savior.”
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Makelin rose from his seat.</p>
          <p>“Then there is only one thing left for me to do.”</p>
          <p>
            Makelin knelt down formally. With a grave and solemn voice, he
            declared to Repenhardt, “On behalf of all dwarves who serve Al Port,
            I, Makelin Port Hammerline, pledge my allegiance to you, Repenhardt
            Wald Antares.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt silently observed the old dwarf, Makelin, kneeling before
            him. He was not surprised by this seemingly abrupt declaration,
            having anticipated it, as it had happened in his past life. Thus, he
            felt no gratification from receiving the dwarves’ loyalty.
          </p>
          <p>Instead, a heavy sense of responsibility weighed on his heart.</p>
          <p>
            He had already betrayed their loyalty once. Despite their loyalty
            and devotion, his incompetence had led them to death and suffering.
          </p>
          <p>Could he truly reciprocate their loyalty in this life?</p>
          <p>‘No, I must.’</p>
          <p>Shaking off his thoughts, Repenhardt reached out his hand.</p>
          <p>“Rise.”</p>
          <p>
            His tone had changed, yet it did not come off as arrogant; instead,
            it felt natural and even warm.
          </p>
          <p>“Your words are half wrong, Makelin.”</p>
          <p>
            As the old dwarf stood up, Repenhardt urgently continued his speech.
          </p>
          <p>“I need your advice now more than ever.”</p>

          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, seated once again across from Makelin, spoke in a
            melancholy voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I have already failed once. I tried to handle everything with my
            power, my magic, and ultimately became humanity’s enemy, meeting my
            death.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He couldn’t repeat the mistakes of his past life. However, he was
            still unsure how he could achieve his dreams by other means than
            power. This was the issue that currently troubled Repenhardt.
            Recovering his magic had been a priority he had put off until now,
            but it was not a problem he could indefinitely delay.
          </p>
          <p>“Of course, I have a few ideas, but none are certain…”</p>
          <p>Makelin asked.</p>
          <p>“What plans do you have?”</p>
          <p>“It’s hardly a plan…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt spoke in a calm voice about his time in the Duchy of
            Chatan. He had taken in elf and orc slaves and given them the same
            education humans received, hoping that this would become a trend and
            spread.
          </p>
          <p>Hearing this, Makelin nodded thoughtfully.</p>
          <p>
            “Hmm, not bad. Enlightening human consciousness to bring about
            gradual change is certainly hopeful for the other races. Of course,
            from my perspective, humans are the other race, but I’ll use this
            term for ease of understanding for you, Repenhardt.”
          </p>
          <p>He added with a smile.</p>
          <p>
            “However, that could easily take 100 years. Elves and we dwarves may
            have the lifespan to endure such a time, but might you not age
            before seeing the changes?”
          </p>
          <p>“That is the problem…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt sighed and leaned back in his chair. Peaceful change
            sounded nice and ideal, but it was also difficult to achieve. No
            matter how great a sage’s philosophy, it could take centuries to be
            rightly recognized. Breaking a fixed paradigm is never easy.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt snapped his fingers.</p>
          <p>“Lairan.”</p>
          <p>
            A small flame sparked at the tip of his finger. It was the most
            basic ignition spell among flame spells, useless in combat and
            typically used as a substitute for flint, a spell learned at the
            beginning of magical training to grasp the basics. However, the fact
            that he had activated it with only a command word, without a magic
            spell, was evidence of Repenhardt’s considerable magical prowess.
          </p>
          <p>Waving the flame slightly, Repenhardt said,</p>
          <p>
            “I am now regaining my magic. And unlike in my past life, I’ve also
            gained another kind of power.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Above the flame-covered finger, a golden aura surged, enveloping the
            flame.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt declared, “Honestly, if I were to regain my magic, it
            wouldn’t be difficult to rebuild the Antares Empire and become a
            Demon King who rules the continent with fear.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was something he had already done once before. He was confident
            that he could enlist the aid of other races again. Unlike his
            previous life, he now possessed an untiring body. Additionally, he
            had never actually intended to establish a nation in his past life;
            it was more of a happenstance that a country of different races had
            formed. If he were to properly plan and establish an empire from the
            start, he felt that failure was unlikely.
          </p>
          <p>However, Repenhardt shook his head.</p>

          <p>
            “But if I do that, I would merely recreate the Dark Empire again.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Rebuilding the Dark Empire would only make it a target of humanity’s
            fear once more.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, unlike his passive past life, if he actively attacked the
            human kingdoms and expanded his power by dominating them, conquering
            the entire continent within a decade wouldn’t be a difficult task.
            He had that much power in his past life. If he had divided and
            conquered from the start, he wouldn’t have met such an end.
          </p>
          <p>
            But that would be equivalent to setting the entire continent ablaze
            with the horrors of war.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I do not wish to drench the continent in blood to that extent.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt sighed. Makelin fell into deep thought. Watching him,
            Repenhardt smiled gently.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do you see my dilemma now, Makelin? If I dominate the world with
            power, I will ultimately fail. Yet, I haven’t found a clear way to
            transform the world without relying on power. I would like to hear
            your advice, wise dwarf.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Makelin stroked his beard silently, seemingly organizing his
            thoughts, before he finally spoke.
          </p>
          <p>“I see the problem.”</p>
          <p>The aged dwarf stared directly at Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>“Repenhardt, my lord.”</p>
          <p>“Speak, Makelin.”</p>
          <p>Makelin replied in his gruff voice.</p>
          <p>“You are taking the world too lightly.”</p>
          <p>“Eh?”</p>
          <p>
            Surprised by the unexpected remark, Repenhardt’s eyes widened.
            Makelin clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You failed because you suppressed with power, and now you seek
            another way?”
          </p>
          <p>“What, what is wrong?”</p>
          <p>Makelin shook his head as if in disappointment.</p>
          <p>
            “Your failure, Lord Repenhardt, was not because you pressed with
            power.”
          </p>
          <p>“Then?”</p>
          <p>Putting strength into his voice, Makelin declared emphatically.</p>
          <p>“It was because you pressed with ‘only’ power.”</p>
          <p>
            Makelin’s voice carried the weight of profound wisdom as he
            continued, “The affairs of the world are not simple. There are
            countless people, and just as many beliefs and opinions. What the
            absolute majority of these beliefs and opinions accept becomes the
            paradigm of that era. How many have had to speak and exchange
            convictions to establish such universally accepted common sense?”
          </p>

          <p>
            “You, Lord Repenhardt, must destroy that fixed common sense. Even if
            you mobilize everything you possess, it may still not be enough. You
            must press with force, persuade with words, sometimes leave things
            to autonomy, and at other times enforce… Even with all these
            methods, it’s uncertain how many years it might take, or even if you
            can succeed at all in achieving your dreams and ambitions.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            “Just because pressing with force failed once doesn’t mean a simple
            change of tactic will suffice. The world isn’t so simple,” Makelin
            advised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt groaned. Every word rang painfully true and hit a sore
            spot. Yet, there was also a sense of enlightenment dawning on him.
          </p>
          <p>“So, what should I do?”</p>
          <p>After organizing his thoughts, Makelin posed another question.</p>
          <p>“Do you hate humans, Lord Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>
            Hate? Repenhardt pondered for a moment. No, it didn’t seem quite
            like that. Despite his attachment to other races, he had never
            regretted being human. He wasn’t dissatisfied with himself to the
            extent of wishing he had been born an orc, elf, dwarf, or troll.
            Sure, he had occasionally wished to be an elf, especially since
            Siris was one; they could have lived together much longer.
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t think so.”</p>
          <p>Makelin asked again.</p>
          <p>“Then, do you like humans?”</p>
          <p>
            This time, Repenhardt needed no hesitation. As a human himself, he
            saw many ugly aspects of humanity.
          </p>
          <p>“Not particularly fond of them, no.”</p>
          <p>Makelin nodded as if he had anticipated this response.</p>
          <p>
            “I thought as much. In your past life stories, there were no human
            companions.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Makelin chuckled wryly, the irony not lost on him. “It might sound
            odd coming from a dwarf, but humans aren’t such bad seeds. Listening
            to you now, Lord Repenhardt, it seems you treated humans as poorly
            as you treated elves, orcs, trolls, and even us dwarves with
            decency.”
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            “Why didn’t you include humans in the army to defend the Antares
            Empire in your past life?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well… I couldn’t trust them… and besides, it wasn’t their war, was
            it? I felt sorry for involving them in a conflict that wasn’t
            theirs…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “And why didn’t you include humans in the administrative roles that
            ran the Antares Empire?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “For the same reason, I couldn’t trust them… Plus, elves and
            dwarves, having longer lifespans, tended to be less corrupt.
            Especially dwarves, who can hear the voice of truth, made clear and
            fair judgments. I thought I had placed everyone where they best
            fit.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Makelin snorted with a smirk as Repenhardt stuttered his excuses.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So… after accepting them as members of the nation, you didn’t grant
            humans any duties or rights necessary to sustain that nation?”
          </p>
          <p>“Is that how it’s interpreted?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his head. In his view, he had implemented
            policies that wouldn’t leave the humans dissatisfied. He had only
            taxed them minimally and hadn’t subjected them to any oppressive
            rule. The burdensome wars were fought by orcs, trolls, or the
            monsters under his control. The complicated tasks of administration
            and politics were handled by dwarves and elves. He thought he had
            allowed humans to simply enjoy their lives, doing what they wanted…
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, you’re saying humans were not even given the opportunity to
            participate in administration or politics?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, things ran much smoother without them… Why bother involving
            them unnecessarily…”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt began to sweat profusely, Makelin let out a hollow
            laugh, then chided him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You’ve done all the things a Demon King would do, haven’t you?”

          <p>[ Chapter 83 ]</p>
          <p>“Is that so?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt made a disgruntled face. He didn’t particularly want to
            argue with Makelin’s words, but he still believed that the humans of
            the Antares Empire were leading relatively happy lives. Compared to
            other countries on the continent, there was less corruption, less
            poverty, and hardly anyone who suffered from abuse.
          </p>
          <p>“Isn’t this enough? What’s the problem?”</p>
          <p>The old dwarf smirked as he looked at his grumbling lord.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, it might be a better world for ordinary peasants. But what
            about the capable ones? Those with knowledge and ambition, those
            like Lord Repenhardt who have the drive and passion to pursue their
            dreams, is it really a good world for them? A world where
            institutional barriers block the way to dreaming, and where there is
            no path for those who wish to advance?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had no retort. He closed his mouth. Makelin’s voice
            softened.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Being a Demon King does not necessarily mean slitting throats with
            bloodshed, tearing flesh, piling up corpses to form mountains, and
            bursting into laughter upon reaching the peak.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a stern yet gentle tone, as if a father were admonishing his
            son, Makelin continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If a powerful being chooses to ignore those around him, listening
            only to the opinions that suit his taste, moving the world according
            to his own preferences…”
          </p>
          <p>The final words fell to a stern-faced Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>“That is exactly what a Demon King is.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt slumped over in his chair, drained of his usual boundless
            energy. Makelin’s direct words had struck his heart without any
            filter, deeply affecting him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You were indeed good, but you were also certainly a Demon King, my
            lord, Repenhardt.”
          </p>
          <p>It was always so.</p>
          <p>There is nothing more painful than the truth in this world.</p>
          <p>
            Observing the depleted Repenhardt, Makelin suddenly tilted his head.
          </p>
          <p>“No, but didn’t I talk about this in my past life?”</p>
          <p>
            Thinking back, it didn’t seem unlikely that his past self would have
            remained silent. Given his personality, if he had served under
            Repenhardt, he would have spoken his mind, regardless of whether it
            brought him hatred or not.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s expression darkened slightly.</p>
          <p>
            In fact, the past-life Makelin hadn’t said such things. When Makelin
            had come to serve under Repenhardt, the continent was already rife
            with a mood of massacring dwarves at any opportunity. It was because
            of the rumors that Demon King Repenhardt was gathering monsters that
            all humans feared the clusters of dwarf slaves.
          </p>

          <p>
            Just for being dwarves, many were put to death. In such
            circumstances, even the wise Makelin could not help but be swept up
            by emotions. Though he did not indiscriminately hate humans, as a
            wise proxy of the gods, he also did not consider mingling with them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The system of the Antares Empire, the very system that Makelin now
            criticized, was ironically largely created by Makelin himself in his
            past life.
          </p>
          <p>As they discussed this, Makelin’s expression also hardened.</p>
          <p>“Is that so? Then I am not one to talk either.”</p>
          <p>
            The two sat in silence for a moment. Repenhardt suddenly scratched
            his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Anyway, that hasn’t happened yet. We just need to do well from now
            on. Hmm.”
          </p>
          <p>He asked,</p>
          <p>
            “Makelin, now that I understand the general issues, what should I
            start with?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Power alone is not enough, but some level of force is necessary to
            change the world. He understood this much. So, how should this force
            be applied?
          </p>
          <p>Makelin replied,</p>
          <p>
            “The biggest mistake you made in your past life, Lord Repenhardt,
            was framing the conflict in terms of humans against other races.”
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt urged for an explanation.</p>
          <p>“So what are you suggesting we do?”</p>
          <p>With a firm voice, Makelin replied.</p>
          <p>
            “Instead of a human versus non-human dynamic, let non-humans take
            sides among humans. While one half of humanity might despise them,
            the perception of the other half can be forcibly changed over time.”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt frowned.</p>
          <p>
            “So, you’re saying we should secretly manipulate the humans into
            fighting each other and then quietly support one side?”
          </p>
          <p>Makelin smirked.</p>
          <p>
            “Do we really need to resort to such tricks? Left to their own
            devices, humans will fervently quarrel among themselves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            And it was true. Without Repenhardt doing anything, wars were
            continuously erupting all over the continent. For power, wealth,
            territory, minor disputes between nations and factions never ceased.
            There was no need for subterfuge; human conflicts were ubiquitous.
          </p>
          <p>
            Makelin’s advice was to subtly intervene in these disputes, gaining
            their support and easing the treatment of elves, dwarves, orcs, and
            trolls through institutional changes.
          </p>
          <p>It sounded rational. Yet, Repenhardt tilted his head in doubt.</p>

          <p>
            “Can humans really let go of their prejudices against non-humans
            that easily?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Makelin wasn’t foolish enough as a dwarf to expect that much from
            humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of course not. Even with such efforts, those who see non-humans as
            more than slaves probably wouldn’t even make up 10 percent. But it’s
            a mistake to be too greedy from the start.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt tapped his head. He was not naive. He could understand
            what Makelin was implying.
          </p>
          <p>
            To press on with force, to change the perception of non-humans
            situationally, to pinpoint the contradictions of the current world
            ideologically, and to politically acknowledge non-humans as a
            distinct faction while reviving their culture and history for
            autonomy—all of these were essential to his dreams and ambitions.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, it’s a headache.”</p>
          <p>“Keep your wits about you. That’s all the advice I can offer.”</p>
          <p>
            Smiling warmly, Makelin looked at the young lord before him, their
            divinely chosen savior. Although he had more to say, as a wise
            dwarf, he knew it was now Repenhardt’s turn to decide.
          </p>
          <p>
            The task of changing the world belonged to Repenhardt; thus, his
            actions must stem from his own will and choices. If Makelin’s
            ideology was entirely correct, Al Port wouldn’t have chosen
            Repenhardt as their savior but would have opted for Makelin instead.
            What he offered was merely advice, providing Repenhardt with the
            ‘information’ needed to make decisions.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt appeared deep in thought, his face marked by seriousness.
            Seeing this, Makelin rose from his seat.
          </p>
          <p>“Do you have any plans moving forward?”</p>
          <p>Snapping back to the present, Repenhardt stood up as well.</p>
          <p>
            “I intend to stay at Grand Forge for a while. I need to spend about
            a month here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            His reason for coming to Grand Forge was certainly to meet Makelin,
            but there were other motives as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I need to borrow the Underground Sun of Al Port, Magrim, for about
            a month.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt turned towards the staircase. It was time to rejoin his
            companions. Makelin followed him, preparing to say farewell.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ll make the arrangements right away. I’ll also prepare lodging
            for the other members of your party.”
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you, Makelin.”</p>
          <p>
            On a ridge where the cold north wind harshly swept through, under a
            sky obscured by dark storm clouds mixed with bright, white snow, a
            tremendous beast roared.
          </p>
          <p>ROAAAAAR!</p>
          <p>
            It was a Drake, a reptilian monster with vast membranous wings and a
            body stretching over 30 meters long. The wings were tangled with
            dozens of ropes and nets, and its body was sporadically pierced with
            numerous arrows and bolts. Surrounding it were about fifty dwarf
            warriors, each robustly muscled and heavily armored, wielding giant
            axes and hammers.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the Drake roared, it opened its mouth wide. A sulfurous smell
            filled the air, and smoke billowed from between its sharp teeth.
          </p>

          <p>WHOOSH!</p>
          <p>
            Flames erupted, scorching the earth as one of the dwarf warriors
            cried out.
          </p>
          <p>“Breath attack! Form up the defense!”</p>
          <p>
            Red flames whipped across the mountain ridge like a fiery lash. A
            wall of fire erupted, radiating intense heat that began to thaw the
            frozen ground. Facing the onslaught of flames, the dwarf warriors
            unitedly raised their shields to protect themselves. From behind,
            two dwarfs raised their hands high and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Al Port, bestow your protection upon us and keep us safe from the
            flames!”
          </p>
          <p>
            A silvery grey aura, reminiscent of iron, enveloped the area,
            bestowing upon the dwarf warriors a divine blessing that increased
            their resistance to heat. Dwarves naturally possess a strong
            resistance to heat, and with the priest’s blessing, they managed to
            preserve themselves even amidst the flames.
          </p>
          <p>GRRRRRR…</p>
          <p>
            As conventional weapons proved ineffective, the Drake showed signs
            of confusion. Seizing the opportunity, the dwarf warriors began to
            fire their crossbows. Once again, dozens of bolts flew towards the
            Drake, targeting its entire body. While most were deflected by its
            thick scales, a good number found their way into the gaps between
            the scales. Enraged by the pain, the Drake became even more
            ferocious.
          </p>
          <p>ROAAAAAR!</p>
          <p>
            It screamed wildly, thrashing its tail repeatedly and slashing
            furiously with its claws. The dwarf warriors skillfully dodged and
            launched their counterattack. They charged from all sides, swinging
            axes and slamming hammers. Some dwarfs were thrown by the beast’s
            tail or claws, but no one screamed in fear. Even those knocked down
            merely let out shallow groans, their eyes burning with fighting
            spirit as they quickly got back on their feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although not as legendary as dragons, a single Drake could easily
            trample a human fiefdom. Such a monster would be a challenge even
            for renowned knightly orders. Yet these fifty or so dwarf warriors
            were holding their ground without yielding.
          </p>
          <p>
            After exhausting the Drake’s stamina through a series of hit-and-run
            tactics, a dwarf shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Now’s the time, use the Cadamite!”</p>
          <p>“Understood!”</p>
          <p>
            With a booming voice, one of the dwarf warriors lunged forward.
            Holding a gigantic axe spear firmly with both hands, the dwarf known
            as Kadamyte rolled once on the ground and covered nearly 20 meters
            in an instant, soaring over the head of the drake. The speed he
            achieved with his short legs was almost unbelievably fast. Kadamyte
            raised his axe spear above his head and let out a powerful shout.
          </p>
          <p>“Uratta!”</p>
          <p>
            The blade of the axe spear emitted a dark red glow, brilliantly
            shining. Kadamyte then swung it down. The dark red aura transformed
            into a giant blade of light, slicing through the shoulder joint of
            the drake. A massive wing was severed in an instant, and a fountain
            of blood spurted out.
          </p>
          <p>Kaaaa!</p>
          <p>
            The drake screamed in terrible pain, flailing its head from side to
            side. Kadamyte, having landed again, held his axe spear in a reverse
            grip and slightly bent his knees. Then, he drew up the aura from his
            entire body.
          </p>
          <p>“Wooooooo!”</p>
          <p>
            Instantly, a reddish-brown aura exploded and swelled around him.
            This was a technique used by dwarf warriors to momentarily increase
            their strength by resonating with the earth’s energy, applying it to
            their aura. Kadamyte amplified the aura around his body nearly
            tenfold and released a roaring cry as he hurled his axe spear.
          </p>
          <p>“Go! Haltron!”</p>
          <p>Whoom, whoom, whoom!</p>
          <p>
            The reddish-brown aura projectile accurately struck the drake’s
            torso. It easily split the steel-like scales and tore through the
            thick muscles, causing a devastating explosion. The blast resounded,
            and fragments of the drake’s flesh and blood scattered through the
            air.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Kadamyte gestured in the air, his axe spear, Haltron,
            automatically withdrew and flew back into his grasp. Watching
            Kadamyte resume his combat stance, the human swordsman, Russ, who
            fought alongside him, was impressed.
          </p>
          <p>‘Incredible…’</p>
          <p>
            Although Russ had seen Kadamyte fight several times before, he
            couldn’t help but admire him each time.
          </p>
          <p>
            At just over a hundred and fifty years old, Kadamyte was considered
            quite young among the dwarves. He was also one of only three aura
            users in the Grand Forge.

          <p>[ Chapter 84 ]</p>
          <p>
            When he first learned of the existence of a Cadamite, the shock he
            felt was immense.
          </p>
          <p>A dwarf among aura wielders?</p>
          <p>
            Aura, a power thought to be awakened only by the primal instincts of
            barbaric beings, is actually the culmination of combat skills
            refined and specialized over generations. A mere orc gladiator,
            driven by savagery, might be a formidable warrior but could never
            awaken to the aura without someone teaching them. Such teaching
            requires a culture of martial arts developed over dozens of
            generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ too had awakened his aura on his own after observing
            Repenhardt. So, it was conceivable that this Cadamite might be a
            genius like Russ, having awakened his aura after witnessing a human
            aura user. However, from what had been observed, that was not the
            case.
          </p>
          <p>
            The power of this first-seen dwarf aura user exceeded anything Russ
            had imagined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his short stature, the Cadamite was remarkably strong. His
            shorter limbs allowed for quicker and more powerful maneuvers than
            humans. The shorter legs meant a more stable center of gravity,
            which almost eliminated vulnerabilities between techniques and quick
            recovery even if his stance was slightly disrupted. Although he had
            a shorter reach compared to humans, as an aura user, this was hardly
            a disadvantage since the aura could be extended. Honestly, Russ
            couldn’t fathom contending with him at this point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the aura techniques this dwarf used, capable of producing
            incredible power instantaneously, were so unique that even
            Repenhardt might doubt his ability to counter them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every aspect of his movement and technique was optimized for a
            dwarf’s physique, separate from human capabilities. Even Russ,
            having observed the aura amplification, couldn’t grasp or replicate
            it immediately. The techniques used by the Cadamite were simply not
            possible with a human body.
          </p>
          <p>
            This dwarf-exclusive aura technique signified one thing: the dwarves
            had a distinct culture and history sufficient to produce their own
            aura wielders.
          </p>
          <p>‘Maybe my brother’s words… weren’t entirely baseless…’</p>
          <p>
            The grandeur of the Grand Forge, the presence of the dwarf aura user
            before him, and the free-spirited dwarves surviving in this harsh
            wilderness by their own will and strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything was shattering Russ’s understanding. All that he had
            considered obvious was falling apart, filling his mind with
            tumultuous thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Russ was momentarily distracted, Cadamite’s pointed remark
            snapped him back to reality.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, Sir Russ! What are you doing?”</p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>
            He had drifted off into his thoughts in the midst of battle again.
            Russ clicked his tongue and lunged forward, brandishing his sword,
            emitting a blue blade aura as he soared to the opposite side of the
            wounded drake.
          </p>
          <p>“Hup!”</p>
          <p>
            The blue aura stretched out, turning into a sharp blade-whip.
            Covering a distance of about ten meters, Russ continuously lashed at
            the drake. Now familiar with maintaining the power while extending
            the aura, the force did not diminish even at this length.
          </p>
          <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Each strike of the aura whip created a thunderous explosion. The
            drake’s scales were sliced, its flesh shredded as it wildly spewed
            flames into the air.
          </p>

          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            The flames targeted Russ, chaotically coloring the air red. However,
            Russ dodged them with the grace of a butterfly, and once more, he
            swung his sword, releasing another blade aura.
          </p>
          <p>“Seven Shredder!”</p>
          <p>
            With a sharp cry, Russ rapidly swung his sword, forming seven blades
            of aura, and launched them at the drake. The crescent-shaped auras
            boomeranged through the air, striking the drake’s body. However,
            this time there was no explosion. The thick scales of the drake
            deflected all the attacks.
          </p>
          <p>“Tch!”</p>
          <p>Russ clicked his tongue and retreated.</p>
          <p>‘Is this still not enough…’</p>
          <p>
            The technique of creating and firing seven aura blades was something
            Russ had devised himself after observing Repenhardt’s explosive
            projectiles. Naming the technique Seven Shredder—advice from
            Repenhardt that naming techniques could help solidify the image and
            proficiency—hadn’t seemed to enhance its effectiveness as expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            While he had become reasonably adept at maintaining power while
            extending the aura, thanks to intensive training and mastering the
            technique of sustaining the aura’s force, he had reached a level
            where he could freely alter the form of his aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, converting the aura into a projectile form and launching it
            from a distance was still a challenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I understand the method somewhat from watching my brother’s
            explosive projectiles, but…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Mastering the technique of manipulating aura was akin to acquiring a
            knack, and as the amount of aura increased, it could be quickly
            learned. However, while one could quickly grasp the knack and learn
            the technique, proficiency was needed to utilize the skill
            powerfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Indeed, mastering and becoming proficient are entirely separate
            matters.’
          </p>
          <p>
            A refreshing voice came from behind Russ as he smacked his lips.
          </p>
          <p>“Nihillen!”</p>
          <p>
            From about 30 meters away on a rocky ridge, Siris, holding a bow of
            light, was aiming at a drake. While the dwarf warriors pressured the
            drake, she kept focusing on Nihillen, amplifying her power. Although
            Siris could not manipulate magic herself, the magical bow Nihillen
            had the inherent power of mana gathering, allowing her to
            continuously charge up power.
          </p>
          <p>Twang!</p>
          <p>
            With the clear sound of the bowstring being released, a beam of
            light shot towards the drake. The arrow of light, concentrated with
            immense magical power, struck the drake like a lance.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The part Russ had missed was precisely compensated by Siris’s arrow.
            Now, not even a scream came out. The drake’s massive body slowly
            began to sink, and eventually, it knelt down. The dwarf warriors
            burst into cheers.
          </p>
          <p>“Oooooh!”</p>

          <p>“We got it!”</p>
          <p>“Hahahaha!”</p>
          <p>
            As the drake lay dying, the dwarves rushed towards it, axes in hand.
            Among them, Tilla, with her hefty battle axe and gleaming eyes, was
            also present.
          </p>
          <p>“It looks like we’re feasting today, huh?”</p>
          <p>Siris just passed by Tilla with a bitter smile, saying nothing.</p>
          <p>
            It had been about a month since Russ, Siris, and Tilla had stayed at
            the Grand Forge, and this was already their sixth time participating
            in surface monster hunts with the dwarf warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Grand Forge was deep underground, making it relatively easy to
            defend against surface monsters. However, securing food was
            challenging. Although the geothermal stones embedded throughout the
            Grand Forge and the artificial suns of Al Port and Magrim provided
            some light, allowing the cultivation of mushrooms and a few edible
            tuber plants underground, feeding nearly a thousand dwarves of the
            Grand Forge was impossible. Thus, the dwarves risked their lives by
            coming to the surface to hunt monsters and supplement their food
            supplies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, the dwarves hadn’t forcibly brought them along. The
            dwarves were not a miserly race to the extent of nagging such
            esteemed guests, who were as significant as saviors of a clan, to
            earn their keep. It was merely that, feeling apologetic for eating
            freely without working for several days, they had volunteered to
            help.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Still, to treat a higher-tier monster like a drake as mere food…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ shook his head. The dwarves were gathered around the lifeless
            corpse of a drake, enthusiastically hacking it with their axes,
            selecting the edible parts to carry away. He had accompanied them on
            such ‘hunts’ several times before, but he still couldn’t get used to
            the sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            How shocked had he been when he first heard about their ‘hunting’?
            The idea of eating monsters… Of course, given the living conditions
            at Grand Forge, he understood that they had little choice, but he
            still couldn’t help feeling a repulsion.
          </p>
          <p>‘But as I eat, it seems to taste okay…’</p>
          <p>
            No matter how desperate the dwarves’ situation was, they didn’t eat
            monsters that resembled humans, like harpies or ogres. The usual
            prey were beast-type monsters like drakes, basilisks, or cockatrices
            caught that day, which surprisingly turned out to be quite
            palatable.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Cockatrice meat tasted a bit like tough pheasant, and the basilisk
            meat wasn’t as bad as I thought…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching the drake being methodically disassembled, Russ smacked his
            lips. What would this creature taste like? After all, a drake was a
            type of reptile, and humans often ate snakes or crocodiles. Even sea
            turtles were considered a delicacy, weren’t they?
          </p>
          <p>‘Considering that, it might actually be quite delicious?’</p>
          <p>
            Humans were creatures of adaptation, and despite his initial
            discomfort, Russ was showing curiosity about the taste.
          </p>
          <p>
            About ten minutes later, the drake had been completely disassembled
            into chunks of meat fit for consumption. The dwarves boldly
            discarded the drake’s scales and horns. While such items might be
            valuable to humans, the dwarves, who could forge far superior armor
            and weapons from metal, had no need for them.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the meat loaded onto a prepared cart and the rest carried on
            their backs, the dwarves prepared to return home. Cadamyte led the
            way, bursting with a cheerful shout.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s head back!”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>

          <p>
            The entrance to Grand Forge was located in various parts of the
            mountain range, but the main entrance, which the dwarves themselves
            called the main gate, was on the middle slopes of Fortraide
            Mountain, the highest peak of the Setelrad mountain range.
            Originally, a large building ten meters tall stood there with
            massive steel gates visible from afar, proudly displaying its
            grandeur. However, it was discreetly concealed with rocks and
            foliage to avoid catching human eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the dwarves burdened with drake meat and Siris’s party reached
            the gate, two dwarf warriors standing guard greeted them warmly.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah! So you caught this beast?”</p>
          <p>“Looks like we’ll get to taste some meaty broth today.”</p>
          <p>
            Both guards let the group pass, visibly excited. Everyone’s faces
            were filled with anticipation for the meat they were about to enjoy.
            Russ sighed again at the heartwarming scene of the dwarf warriors
            congratulating each other and sharing their joy. No matter how hard
            he tried to view it objectively, their behavior seemed no different
            from that of humans.
          </p>
          <p>-Follow me. See with your own eyes and judge for yourself.</p>
          <p>
            The longer he stayed, the more Repenhardt’s words echoed in his
            mind. With a stern face, Russ followed the other members of the
            party into the underground passage leading to Grand Forge.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was about 30 minutes later when they arrived at Grand Forge.
            Suddenly, Siris tilted her head curiously. A boy with red hair was
            running towards them frantically. It seemed like something urgent
            had happened, but his expression was not one of distress; rather, he
            looked like a puppy happily greeting its returning owner.
          </p>
          <p>‘Wow, were you really that happy to see us back?’</p>
          <p>
            Siris, Russ, and Tilla had been out hunting while Sillan had stayed
            inside Grand Forge. Following Repenhardt’s advice, he had been busy
            implementing a special physical training program for the entire
            month, which left him unable to join the hunts. The intensity of the
            training meant that he wasn’t in a condition to hunt, especially
            without using healing magic. As a result, he had often been left
            alone…
          </p>
          <p>‘Was he really feeling lonely?’</p>
          <p>
            Understanding this, Siris’s perspective shifted, and although a bit
            startled, she tried to smile as she spoke.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, Sillan. We’re back…”</p>
          <p>“Hahahaha!”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Sillan burst into insane laughter, dancing around and
            shaking his shoulders. He grabbed Siris’s hand and Tilla’s shoulder,
            and enthusiastically shook hands with Russ, continuing to wave his
            hands excitedly.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
          <p>“Sillan, why are you acting like this?”</p>
          <p>“Snap out of it!”</p>
          <p>“Hehehehehe!”</p>
          <p>
            Regardless of the party’s surprise, Sillan just kept on releasing
            his strange laughter. Even the dwarves began to murmur at his
            bizarre behavior. Finally, Sillan stopped laughing and looked at his
            friends with serious eyes.
          </p>
          <p>Russ asked, “What’s the matter, Sillan?”</p>
          <p>
            With a triumphant gesture, forming a ‘V’ with his fingers, Sillan
            shouted proudly.
          </p>
          <p>“I grew 1 centimeter!”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>“I grew taller! By 1 centimeter!”</p>
          <p>
            Indeed, after following the schedule Repenhardt had set for a month,
            Sillan’s body had finally begun to grow normally. It was only 1
            centimeter, but for Sillan, who hadn’t grown even a single
            millimeter since he was fourteen, this was truly an incredible
            miracle!

          <p>[ Chapter 85 ]</p>
          <p>
            Russ and Siris finally grasped the significance and were genuinely
            surprised.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh!”</p>
          <p>“Really?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris and Russ, having long observed how Silan was deeply
            self-conscious about his naturally frail physique, were genuinely
            delighted and congratulated him warmly.
          </p>
          <p>“Good for you, Silan!”</p>
          <p>“That’s great! Congratulations, Silan!”</p>
          <p>
            With bright smiles, Siris and Russ, and in the middle, Silan, who
            seemed almost ready to dance in joy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Tilla and the other dwarves looked on, utterly baffled.
          </p>
          <p>“Why are they so happy?”</p>
          <p>“He grew taller.”</p>
          <p>“But why are they happy about that?”</p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know. Do humans only recognize worth if someone is tall?”
          </p>
          <p>Recalling the dwarven perspective, Siris quickly translated.</p>
          <p>
            “So for a dwarf, it’s like having their shoulders widen by one
            centimeter.”
          </p>

          <p>
            At last, the dwarves also offered their heartfelt congratulations.
            “Oh! You must be pleased! Amazing! Congratulations!” and so forth.
          </p>
          <p>
            For dwarves, manliness was symbolized not by height but by the
            breadth of shoulders and chest thickness. Likewise, while women
            appreciated fuller chests and wider hips, they showed little
            interest in height.
          </p>
          <p>In the midst of these celebrations, Russ suddenly asked.</p>
          <p>“But what about your brother?”</p>
          <p>
            It was a reminder that they should first inform the creator of this
            miracle(?). Silan pouted in response.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, as usual.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, is he still there today?”</p>
          <p>
            Recalling the reason they had been staying in the Grand Forge for a
            month, Russ nodded.
          </p>
          <p>
            A month ago, upon returning from meeting with Makelin, Repenhardt
            declared.
          </p>
          <p>-I’ll be staying in the Grand Forge for a while.</p>
          <p>
            When asked why, he explained that a device necessary to replenish
            his depleted magical energy was located here, meaning he couldn’t
            leave for some time. Since then, Repenhardt had been spending most
            of his days inside the massive steel tower at the center of the
            Grand Forge. He only emerged to eat, sleep, and occasionally train
            to prevent the decline of his physical and martial skills.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nobody was particularly upset about the delay. After all, there were
            no urgent schedules to keep. Silan was pleased to have the chance to
            build his muscles. Russ was also enhancing his skills by regularly
            sparring not only with Repenhardt but also with other dwarven aura
            users. Tilla and Siris were improving their martial skills and
            gaining experience through hunting magical beasts. It was a
            fulfilling time for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there was still lingering curiosity. Silan tilted his head
            in wonder.
          </p>
          <p>“What exactly is he doing in there?”</p>
          <p>
            When entering the steel tower, Repenhardt had firmly declared that
            no one should approach it. He had made sure that his companions, as
            well as the dwarves through Makelin, could not come near. It was
            unusual for Repenhardt to prevent even Siris from getting close; his
            behavior did not usually align with such restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>Russ suggested a possible explanation.</p>

          <p>
            “It is said that a warrior who has reached a certain level of
            mastery needs time alone for reflection to attain enlightenment.
            Even a minor external disturbance could be problematic. I don’t know
            much about magic, but perhaps it’s something similar?”
          </p>
          <p>That seemed plausible. Silan nodded in understanding.</p>
          <p>“Ah, is that it?”</p>
          <p>
            Located in the central part of the Grand Forge, the towering steel
            structure, which housed the residence of the High Priest Makelin at
            its upper levels, was the heart of this vast underground city. The
            Grand Forge was powered by geothermal stones, which were crucial for
            its operation, laid out in arrays every hundred meters. The magical
            energy that powered these geothermal stones flowed from this steel
            tower.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other parts of the continent, enslaved dwarves managed their
            villages with human magicians regularly recharging these geothermal
            stones. However, the geothermal stones in the Grand Forge were not
            powered by dwarf magic. Humans, fearing the dwarves’ ability to
            create powerful magical tools, had done everything to sever their
            knowledge of magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to these efforts, the Grand Forge currently had no one who
            possessed knowledge of magic, although it did have priests capable
            of casting divine spells of Al Fort and warriors awakened to aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ability to wield aura was clandestinely preserved, primarily
            through the motions of smithing, building, and mining with a
            pickaxe. These movements were concealed as part of everyday tasks, a
            practice not uncommon even among humans, who often disguised
            traditional martial arts as dance forms to ensure their transmission
            to future generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Religious faith, more a domain of wisdom than of mere knowledge, has
            a profound depth but is not informationally dense. Essentially,
            possessing a single scripture of Al Fort could suffice to sustain
            the teachings. Hence, despite being enslaved, dwarves were able to
            maintain their faith through oral traditions passed down from their
            ancestors.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the knowledge of magic is vast. While some dwarven
            magicians survived, most were of low proficiency, and unlike
            priests, a magician cannot enhance their skills without substantial
            knowledge. Unfortunately, much of this magical knowledge had been
            buried by human efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dwarves, having lost their great magicians and much of their
            magical lore, found salvation in the sacred underground sun of Al
            Fort, Magrim.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a massive stone chamber sealed on all sides, with magical
            conduits sprawling in every direction, hovered a large orb of fire
            about 8 meters in diameter. Pulsing like a heart, this fiery mass
            sent massive amounts of magical energy through the pipes to various
            parts of the forge. This was Magrim, the lifeblood of the Grand
            Forge, not just a source of energy but akin to a living entity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standing before the vigorously pulsing Magrim, shirtless, was a
            young man. His well-toned, bronze muscles glistened with sweat,
            softly illuminated by the glow of the fire orb. As he wiped the
            sweat from his forehead, Repenhardt muttered to himself,
          </p>
          <p>“The Silver Age was indeed remarkable…”</p>
          <p>
            Though named the underground sun of Al Fort, Magrim was actually an
            artifact from the Silver Age, not a sacred creation by Al Fort
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The divine power of a god is influenced by the influence of their
            followers. As the dwarves’ prominence on the continent diminished,
            so too did Al Fort’s ability to intervene in worldly affairs. What
            Al Fort could presently do was merely to awaken the slumbering heart
            of the Grand Forge, Magrim, with his divine power.
          </p>

          <p>
            This in itself was a miracle that no modern magician could achieve,
            so it couldn’t be said that the dignity of a god was compromised.
            The dwarves’ reverence for Al Fort as the underground sun had some
            justification.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, I know how to operate it too…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt chuckled ruefully, scratching his chin. In his past life,
            he had spent nearly a year studying Magrim, and he had eventually
            managed to control even this supposed god-only artifact at will.
            Inspired by this, he had also created the 10th circle ultimate
            destruction magic, Nuclear Burst.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I did seal it away after firing it just once, shocked at its
            power.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Though there was a penalty of spending at least a month in spell
            calculation and mana charging, this supremely powerful spell could
            obliterate the capital of a sizable nation in one strike, a power
            that even Repenhardt himself found terrifying. In his past life, he
            had used Nuclear Burst in actual combat only once. It was merely to
            break the morale of his enemies by annihilating a couple of
            uninhabited mountains during the destruction of the Vasily Kingdom.
            Even the mighty Repenhardt could not bring himself to unleash such
            brutishly extensive destructive magic on people.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Thanks to that, the Vasily Kingdom was easily destroyed, but the
            aftermath was no joke.’
          </p>
          <p>
            He had instantly earned the notorious title of ‘Demon King’ across
            the continent. Previously cautious nations turned ashen and united
            against him. When an army of two million marched against him at the
            end, he didn’t have time to prepare the magic and couldn’t use it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflecting on his past life’s memories, Repenhardt clicked his
            tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, still immersed in his thoughts, finally felt his body’s
            magical energy replenished. It was time to resume his magical
            practices using Magrim.
          </p>
          <p>He sighed deeply, his frustration evident.</p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>
            Then he looked down at the ground, up at the ceiling, and wore an
            expression of utter exasperation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve been doing this forever, but I still can’t get used to it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, he was engaged in using the power of Magrim to transform
            Teslon’s body into one more conducive to magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            His computational abilities had improved somewhat thanks to using
            the voice of Elucion. The next challenge was filling the
            deficiencies in magical power. Despite his efforts to manipulate
            magic, the capacity of this body to hold magic was frustratingly
            unresponsive.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were many ways to augment the lacking magical power. He had
            artifacts from the Divine Spirits of his previous life, and even if
            not those, there were artifacts from the Silver Age that could drain
            mana. By diligently scouring his memories for relics and collecting
            artifacts, accumulating magic itself was feasible.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, no matter how much water one could scoop from a lake, it
            was pointless if the container was only as big as a small jar. The
            container itself needed to be expanded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had opted for a method that involved resonating his own
            magic with a powerful magical entity to increase his capacity for
            magic. This required highly delicate manipulation of magic, a
            challenging task, but not overly so for a grand sorcerer like him.
            Initially, he planned to perform this with the Mana Core Yudram in
            the ruins of Dalkas in the southern continent, but Magrim was
            equally effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            The challenge lay in the need to make as much contact as possible
            with the magic entity to improve his body’s constitution. An even
            bigger issue was that for the resonance of magic, not even the
            slightest foreign substance could be present between them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, this ritual of bodily improvement had to be performed
            completely naked.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, how embarrassing…”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 86 ]</p>
          <p>
            Sighing, Repenhardt took off his trousers. His muscular and
            appealing buttocks were clearly exposed. Something sizable swung
            forward as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Completely naked now, Repenhardt first blocked his senses. It was
            crucial not to let other senses interfere as he focused his mind on
            the magic resonance. Then, he leapt onto the magrim.
          </p>
          <p>Slap!</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt spread his limbs wide and adhered in a spread-eagle
            position to the scorching surface of the fireball. Although he was
            stuck to the ball of fire, it wasn’t hot at all. Once the resonance
            of magic occurred, the heat from the magrim couldn’t harm him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem was that no matter how one looked at it, he resembled a
            frog stuck to a wall under the scorching midsummer sun.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sight of the muscular man, his rear fully exposed and sticking
            tightly, was indeed a frightful scene that could haunt one’s dreams.
            It might have a profound effect on someone needing weight control.
            Clearly, it was a sight not meant to be shown to others.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It absolutely can’t happen! I can’t show this sight to anyone!
            Especially not to Siris!’
          </p>
          <p>
            Feeling relieved that he had made sure no one could approach,
            Repenhardt continued to cling to the magrim. As the surface of the
            magrim moved about, so did Repenhardt. Each movement caused red heat
            to shimmer over his bronze buttocks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as fish need to be flipped to cook evenly and brown nicely,
            Repenhardt decided it was time to shift the resonance to the front
            after a while. He straightened his back and pressed it against the
            magrim, inevitably causing something(!) in the front to swing.
          </p>
          <p>‘Oh, what a sight this is, alas…’</p>
          <p>
            But to achieve his dream, Repenhardt knew he must overcome even
            minor hardships! With a flushed face, he struggled to turn his body
            over. He fervently wished for the day his constitution would
            improve.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘At least no one is watching. If someone were to see me like this…
            ugh…’
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt was unaware that there were secretly placed
            surveillance holes in the corner of the chamber, using mirror
            reflections. This chamber, where the solar magrim was located, was
            among the most critical places for the dwarves. It was necessary to
            always keep an eye on it in case something went wrong.
          </p>
          <p>
            About 30 meters from the chamber was the magrim observation room.
          </p>
          <p>
            There, a group of dwarf matrons were swallowing their saliva as they
            watched the reflection in the mirror.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Look at that back. It’s finely sculpted. Ah, our husbands are
            nothing compared to this.”
          </p>
          <p>“Look at those forearms.”</p>
          <p>“His buttocks are so plump.”</p>
          <p>
            These were veteran housewives who had been married for decades. The
            shame of seeing a naked man was a thing of the past for them. They
            were all joyously admiring Repenhardt’s muscles. Despite being
            called matrons, dwarf women often looked youthful, appearing like
            girls with only their bosoms being voluptuous. It was a terrifying
            sight as these seemingly teenage-like women gathered, exchanging
            risqué jokes.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh my! He’s turning over! He’s turning over!”</p>
          <p>“Look at that thick chest.”</p>

          <p>“And he’s got some real goods there.”</p>
          <p>“How nice~.”</p>
          <p>
            Of course, Repenhardt, unaware of any of this, continued to rub his
            entire body against the magrim.
          </p>
          <p>‘At least no one is watching. What a relief, let’s keep at it!’</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            On the fortieth day of his stay at the Grand Forge, Repenhardt was
            shouting with joy inside the stone chamber where the magrim was
            located.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s done!”</p>
          <p>
            He beamed a wide smile, lifting both hands to his chest, and began
            to chant softly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hast Garatad Delpinard. Hahnseol’s son, being of the northern wind,
            come forth by my will! Frost Elementor!”
          </p>
          <p>
            His hands shimmered, forming a fierce magical storm in the air.
            Soon, a swirling vortex of ice over three meters tall sprang up,
            scattering coldness all around. Repenhardt grinned broadly. He had
            successfully summoned the Frost Elementor, a fifth circle summoning
            spell of the ice spirits.
          </p>
          <p>“Good, it worked as expected.”</p>
          <p>
            With a wave of his hand, the Frost Elementor soon disappeared. Still
            feeling the aftereffects of the magic tingling in his right hand,
            Repenhardt looked down with a satisfied expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how much he meditated, until now, his innate magical power
            had been too low to employ spells above the fourth circle. But now,
            he could handle up to the fifth circle, and with some effort, even
            sixth circle spells were within reach.
          </p>
          <p>
            His constitution improvement was finally complete. No longer did he
            need to expose his rear and roll over fireballs!
          </p>
          <p>
            Overcome with emotion, Repenhardt quickly put on his trousers first.
            Then, finally relaxed, he muttered to himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Phew, I planned for a month, but it took 40 days. Why does this
            body of mine always have to be so resistant to magic?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt concentrated and measured his magical power. His body’s
            formerly meager magical power had astonishingly increased, now
            seemingly reaching the level he had in his mid-twenties.
          </p>
          <p>
            “All that’s left is to travel around and increase my magic power.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There was no longer any business for him in this place. With a
            relieved expression, Repenhardt left the stone chamber. He walked
            briskly through the Grand Forge, heading back to his lodging while
            pondering his next steps.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Should I start by searching for the relics of the Four Gods? Or,
            since it’s nearly spring, maybe I should visit the Chatan Duchy
            first? If I follow Makelin’s advice, I’ll need to stop by the
            Crovence Kingdom too. I guess I should start by visiting the ruins
            and go from there.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Lost in his thoughts, Repenhardt moved along. Now that his
            constitution improvement was complete, his steps felt remarkably
            light. How anxiously had he clung to the magrim over the past 40
            days, fearing discovery? Every day was a continuous strain of
            nervousness.
          </p>
          <p>‘But in the end, I wasn’t caught. Hahaha.’</p>

          <p>
            Repenhardt continued walking with a proud smile. Although the dwarf
            women on the street were showing peculiar behaviors—smiling slyly,
            nodding without reason, and even giving thumbs-ups—poor Repenhardt,
            oblivious to all, merely strode along cheerfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon reaching his lodging, he saw Sillan doing pull-ups. Repenhardt
            was slightly impressed.
          </p>
          <p>‘Huh? This guy, he’s gained some muscle?’</p>
          <p>
            During the 40 days, Sillan had focused solely on physical training,
            having sealed his healing magic. He had changed quite a bit—although
            not to the extent of becoming notably manly. Had he transformed from
            a frail, delicate beauty to a lively, healthy one? Considering that
            Sillan was indeed a man, there was still a long way to go.
          </p>
          <p>
            But to speak such truth outright was not the attitude of an adult.
            After moistening his lips slightly, Repenhardt spoke.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow! Sillan, you’ve become quite manly, haven’t you?”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Having just finished his pull-ups, Sillan stopped wiping his sweat
            and turned around with a surprised look. He quickly ran over and
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>“Really? Does it really show that much?”</p>
          <p>“Of course…”</p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt nodded, Sillan’s face lit up with joy. Feeling
            somewhat guilty, Repenhardt averted his gaze. After all, Sillan had
            indeed grown taller, and it wasn’t like the changes were entirely
            unnoticeable.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Sillan tilted his head in confusion.</p>
          <p>“But why are you back so early? It’s not even mealtime.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, I’ve finally finished.”</p>
          <p>Sillan immediately understood what had ended.</p>
          <p>“So, you’ll be leaving the Grand Forge soon?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            At that, Sillan’s face showed a mix of emotions, and Repenhardt let
            out a forced laugh.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Why? Have you grown so fond of this place that you don’t want to
            leave?”
          </p>
          <p>“Well, there’s that, but…”</p>
          <p>
            In truth, besides his physical training, Sillan had been busy
            spreading the teachings of Philanence to the dwarves during his rest
            periods. Since Philanence’s teachings were essentially akin to a
            guide on romance or a manual for marital life, they had been quite
            popular among the dwarves. It seems that issues of love and
            relationships transcend species, garnering empathy from everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Given his efforts, it was natural for Sillan to want to see the
            results, and his hesitation to leave was understandable.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, that wasn’t the only reason Sillan was feeling awkward.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The thing is, Mr. Russ suddenly got a feeling and, like you, rented
            a chamber to seclude himself.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Apparently, Russ, who had been sparring frequently with a dwarf aura
            master, had an epiphany two days ago and had since sequestered
            himself in a quiet room.
          </p>
          <p>
            “He took about a week’s worth of food and said not to let anyone in
            until he decides to come out himself.”
          </p>
          <p>“No wonder I haven’t seen Russ around lately…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue. It was not uncommon for martial
            artists who had awakened their aura to seek solitude after gaining
            enlightenment, occasionally isolating themselves from the world for
            days. He had heard that his master, Gerard, had similar experiences
            in his youth. Of course, Repenhardt had never experienced such
            martial enlightenment himself, so he just accepted it for what it
            was.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Already an enlightenment? How long has it been since he awakened
            his aura?’
          </p>
          <p>
            While Repenhardt, nearly four years into his aura awakening, had yet
            to experience such an epiphany, Russ had seemingly grasped something
            significant and immediately commenced his practice. Perhaps he truly
            was a prodigy?
          </p>
          <p>Understanding the situation, Repenhardt smacked his lips.</p>
          <p>“Well, he won’t be coming out for a while, then.”</p>
          <p>
            Opportunities like this don’t come often in life. Indeed, they may
            never come at all. Such precious moments must not be missed, so now
            it was a matter of waiting for Russ to come out on his own.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, staying a few more days before we depart won’t cause any
            major issues. Oh, but what about Tilla and Siris?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Tilla is training with other dwarf warriors. Siris said she went
            out for a walk… I’m not sure where she is right now.”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            As she watched the young dwarf children swinging wooden hammers and
            axes around a skillfully carved wooden drake, Siris felt a pang of
            nostalgia. The dwarf children, embodying their culture even in play,
            wielded toys that were so finely crafted they could function as real
            weapons in human hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            They struck the wooden drake from all angles. Though it was just a
            game now, one day these children would become true warriors, bearing
            steel weapons to fight for their tribe. Their expressions were
            utterly serious, a testament to their future responsibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standing a bit apart on the stairs, Siris watched them with a
            distant gaze.
          </p>
          <p>
            The noisy children overlaid by faint images like ghosts—images of a
            harsh wasteland where the sun mercilessly scorched the earth, and
            small elf children, from Siris’s own past, raced across it.
          </p>
          <p>“I caught a Sakko lizard!”</p>
          <p>“I found Silphard grass!”</p>
          <p>“Wow, that root tastes good!”</p>
          <p>
            It was a harsh environment where gathering daily sustenance was the
            entirety of their routine, a tough life for the young elves of the
            Danhaim clan. For them, playing was a survival act, just like
            collecting food to help the adults. Their play, much like that of
            these dwarf children, was training for survival—not a life of ample
            food as might be had by elves or dwarfs raised by human hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, those young elves had smiles on their faces, just like the
            dwarf children before her.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>
            Feeling a bitter wind sweeping through her, Siris sighed weakly. It
            was a memory from decades ago, thought to be forgotten, believed to
            be something she would never recall again.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Why is it that seeing these children brings back memories so
            painfully vivid?’ she wondered. These were memories from a childhood
            she had surrendered, with no lingering attachments or dreams left.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris smiled weakly, lost in the throes of her thoughts. It was then
            that something happened.

          <p>[ Chapter 87 ]</p>
          <p>“Siris?”</p>
          <p>Startled, Siris turned her head.</p>
          <p>“Ah, Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had been wandering around the Grand Forge for a while
            looking for Siris.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
          <p>Siris replied absently.</p>
          <p>“I was watching the children.”</p>
          <p>“The children?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked puzzled, turning his gaze as he tilted his head,
            watching the dwarf children. Siris silently watched his profile.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>
            Her master, once thought to be merely a pervert. But now, a man with
            astonishing martial and magical powers, dreaming an absurd dream of
            changing the fate of other races.
          </p>
          <p>And… always looking at her with warm eyes…</p>
          <p>Siris inadvertently spoke out.</p>
          <p>“These children are free.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked back at her with somber eyes. A soft, somewhat
            melancholic voice followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The tough life of hardship awaits these children… There are those
            among them who will not live to grow up…”
          </p>
          <p>“…Siris.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt uttered her name almost like a moan. Siris was flustered.
            ‘Why am I talking about this?’ But once opened, her lips continued
            to spill the thoughts of her heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yet, these children are free. Like my people when I was young…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s expression hardened. Clamping her mouth shut, Siris
            clicked her tongue. She didn’t even know why she had said those
            things. It wasn’t even a complaint…
          </p>
          <p>She forced her expression to harden.</p>
          <p>“It’s nothing. I just suddenly thought of home…”</p>
          <p>
            After getting up from her seat, Siris spoke with a calm expression.
          </p>
          <p>“You came back a bit early today. I’ll prepare dinner.”</p>
          <p>
            With that, she strode away. Repenhardt’s expression sank as he
            watched her go.
          </p>
          <p>‘Home, huh…’</p>
          <p>He already knew where Siris’s homeland was.</p>
          <p>
            The Spelrat Desert in the western part of the Graim Kingdom, a
            remote area in the western continent, a barren land of only sand and
            rocks where no human was allowed. The land of lamentation where her
            family, the Dahnhaim tribe, had lived.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a past life, Repenhardt had visited there several times with
            Siris.
          </p>

          <p>
            ‘After all, it’s practically my in-laws’ home, so how could I not
            visit?’
          </p>
          <p>That’s when Repenhardt realized.</p>
          <p>‘Wait? Haven’t I visited there at all in this life?’</p>
          <p>
            Siris remembered that all her kin had died, but the reality was
            slightly different. Indeed, when Siris, then a child, was kidnapped
            by slavers, the Dahnhaim kin had been driven to the brink of
            extinction. However, a few elves had barely managed to escape and
            when they later returned to the Land of Wailing, they found a
            substantial number of elves still alive. The memory of how overjoyed
            Siris had been at that time was still vivid in her mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah, I feel like I have already been back, so I didn’t think of it…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt chastised himself as he smacked his forehead. Knowing how
            happy Siris would be, yet he hadn’t even thought about it until now…
            Returning to the past and knowing the future was advantageous, but
            having memories of a future that hadn’t happened yet often led to
            confusion.
          </p>
          <p>“Tsk, I was careless.”</p>
          <p>
            With a click of his tongue, Repenhardt made a decision. Now that he
            had about five days of free time because of Russ, he resolved to
            earn some points with Siris!
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking the lead, Repenhardt grabbed Siris’s hand as his eyes
            sparkled.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris!”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            At his call, Siris turned her head with a blank expression.
            Repenhardt continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Since it came up, why don’t we visit your homeland for a while?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Her expressionless face suddenly lit up with emotion. Seeing the
            bewildered Siris, Repenhardt smiled triumphantly.
          </p>
          <p>“Just the two of us.”</p>
          <p>
            Indeed, this was what he had truly aimed for. A trip just for the
            two of them, how cozy and wonderful would that be?
          </p>
          <p>Siris asked incredulously.</p>
          <p>“It will take at least two months to get there, you know?”</p>
          <p>
            It was a valid concern. The Spelrat Desert, where the Land of
            Wailing was located, and the Setelrad Mountains where they currently
            were, sat nearly at opposite ends of the continent—north and west
            respectively. The distance was not minor by any means.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt was not so foolish as to overlook such details,
            being a powerful sorcerer often referred to as a demon king.
            Although having Teslon’s body had habituated him to handling things
            with brute force, he was not simple-minded.
          </p>
          <p>Grinning slyly, Repenhardt confidently replied.</p>
          <p>“Here, at Grand Forge, there is a way.”</p>
          <p>
            Deep within the heart of Gairak’s Grand Castle, the Abyssal Throne.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Until yesterday, this hall boasted its grandeur as the greatest
            architectural marvel on the surface, but now it stood in ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            The once sturdy granite walls bore horrific signs of destruction,
            appearing as if they might collapse at any moment. The marble floors
            were ripped apart and cracked as if they had encountered an
            earthquake. Fires blazed here and there, casting intense heat all
            around. Cold dawn light seeped through the cracks in the shattered
            ceiling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beneath the faint light of the early dawn, two men faced each other.
          </p>
          <p>
            A man in a blood-red robe with long black hair spoke in a feeble
            voice to his opponent.
          </p>
          <p>“You are strong, Fist King Teslon…”</p>
          <p>
            The towering middle-aged man, reminiscent of an iron tower, wiped
            the blood from his mouth and responded.
          </p>
          <p>“It is our victory, Demon King Repenhardt.”</p>

          <p>Despite his pain, Teslon managed a smile of victory.</p>
          <p>
            They had won. They had finally subdued the ‘Nightmare of the
            Continent.’
          </p>
          <p>Demon King Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>
            The emperor of the Dark Empire of Antares, the strongest and most
            malevolent sorcerer in human history.
          </p>
          <p>
            He commanded a million forces of darkness, summoned demons from
            another world, scorched half the continent, and slaughtered
            millions—a true demon god incarnate among humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            How many lives had been lost in the effort to bring down this wicked
            sorcerer who harbored an infinite hatred for humanity?
          </p>
          <p>
            Millions in the army had sacrificed their lives to carve a path
            through the dark forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Numerous heroes had given their lives battling demons from another
            realm.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bleeding rivers of blood and sacrificing their lives like stray
            dogs, they never hesitated to give up their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was on the backs of these countless sacrifices that they had
            finally made it here. Through the setting of the sun and the rising
            of the moon, through the waning of the moon and the arrival of dawn,
            they fought with all their might against the Demon King. But the
            power of Repenhardt, the Nightmare of the Continent, was
            unimaginably tremendous. Swordsmanship, martial arts, divine power,
            magic, etc., even his comrades who had reached the pinnacle in their
            respective fields fell one by one, vomiting blood before the
            limitless magical power of the Demon King.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the chill of dawn enveloped the surroundings, only one stood
            among them, the one with the strongest physique, hence called
            ‘Unbreakable,’ Fist King Teslon.
          </p>
          <p>Though all his comrades had fallen, Teslon did not give up.</p>
          <p>
            Fending off cascading despair with a single blade of will, Teslon
            endured and endured. Then, in the final moment, with an iron will,
            he burned all his life force, moving his body, which seemed on the
            brink of death, to deliver the first and last strike.
          </p>
          <p>“Ku, kugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was continuously vomiting blood. The blackened blood,
            like rot, was evidence that his body was rapidly dying.
          </p>
          <p>“Finally, everything is over…”</p>
          <p>
            Teslon murmured with an emotional expression. Memories of past
            events flashed before his eyes like a fast-moving lantern slide.
          </p>
          <p>
            Countless sacrifices, endless pain, frenzied orcs, dwarves, trolls,
            and elves swarming in demonic frenzy, many comrades dying at their
            hands…
          </p>
          <p>Their sacrifices were not in vain.</p>
          <p>Never in vain.</p>
          <p>
            “…Now the others will also escape from the demonic influence and
            return to their original forms.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything would return to normal. Orcs, elves, and dwarves would
            regain their gentle and good-natured temperaments, living peacefully
            as friends of humanity.
          </p>
          <p>Now, it was time to end everything.</p>
          <p>“Disappear, Nightmare of the Continent!”</p>
          <p>
            With a solemn voice, Teslon clenched his fist. Now, all that
            remained was to deliver the final blow to that wicked Demon King.
          </p>
          <p>That’s when it happened. Repenhardt gave a faint smile.</p>
          <p>“Hehehe…”</p>
          <p>
            A sly smile surfaced on the face of the dying Demon King. Teslon was
            startled. What cunning trick was he planning to pull in this
            situation by smiling?
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the Demon King pulled something from his bosom. It was a small
            red gem. From the bowed head of Repenhardt, a chilling voice flowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “La Fert Dem Ested Sapia… I, twisting the righteous laws, shall
            deceive the eyes of fate…”
          </p>

          <p>“Kugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Startled, Teslon summoned all his strength. From the red gem the
            Demon King had revealed, a sinister energy was emanating. It was
            invisible but distinctly palpable, a powerful and overwhelming
            unknown force!
          </p>
          <p>
            With a look of having been blindsided, Teslon desperately lunged
            forward.
          </p>
          <p>‘Could it be that he still had strength left!’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt lifted his head. A bizarre light leaked from his black
            eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            “…I shall remain under the law of Heaven’s defiance, against the
            current…”
          </p>
          <p>“Impossible, you monster!”</p>
          <p>
            Teslon’s massive form shot through the hall like a cannonball. He
            had to block it. Whatever the trick, it had to be stopped.
          </p>
          <p>“AAAAAAAAAH!”</p>
          <p>
            With his last strength, Teslon’s right fist, wrapped in golden chi,
            smashed through Repenhardt’s magical barrier. His fist, glowing with
            energy, ferociously thrust toward the red gem.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, a devilish voice wailing as if from hell filled
            Teslon’s ears.
          </p>
          <p>“…I shall become the one who reverses time and space!”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Teslon opened his eyes.</p>
          <p>“Heaving! Heaving!”</p>
          <p>Breathing heavily, he looked at his fist extended into the air.</p>
          <p>‘Again this dream…’</p>
          <p>
            Looking at his outstretched right hand, which was well-trained but
            comparatively weak compared to the past, Teslon sighed. Then,
            lowering his hand, he got up.
          </p>
          <p>‘Hmm, must have dozed off.’</p>
          <p>
            Last night, he had stayed up practicing both magic and martial arts,
            and it seemed he had fallen asleep momentarily.
          </p>
          <p>‘I just meant to lie down for a bit to cool off my head…’</p>
          <p>
            Clicking his tongue, Teslon rose from the sofa and walked to the
            window. The afternoon sunlight brilliantly illuminated the table
            filled with various documents. These were the personal details of
            the strong individuals of this era and those ‘destined to become’
            strong that he had investigated.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside them were booklets containing information about future
            meteorological changes and the political situations of various
            countries. All of this was precious information that he had
            painstakingly revived by continuously dredging up vague old
            memories. Human memory being unreliable, he had written these down
            whenever he had time since his reincarnation at sixteen in this era.
          </p>
          <p>Looking down at the documents and booklets, Teslon muttered.</p>
          <p>“Still not enough…”</p>
          <p>
            For the past six years, he had been constantly on the move without a
            day’s rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had mastered the realm of aura to its extremes and, using that,
            had managed to awaken to aura at the age of twenty even with
            Repenhardt’s body. He used that to coerce the elders of Delphia’s
            mage tower into granting him the status of a regular mage.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had also made connections with future strong figures in the
            world. Although they were weak now, these bonds with those who would
            eventually become powerful would later be a great strength to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had successfully become a member of the Silver Sages using future
            information. The Silver Sages, who were secretive about their
            existence, had recognized Teslon’s ‘wisdom,’ which could even
            foresee the future, and decided it was more beneficial to ally with
            him than to oppose him. It was as he had expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it was still not enough. To become the ‘strong’ figure his
            connections desired, he needed more time. Even as a Silver Sage, he
            had no real authority. The only thing he had managed was to secure
            the patronage of Duke Iranad, a fellow Silver Sage.
          </p>
          <p>‘I can’t defeat the Demon King with just this!’</p>
          <p>
            Teslon crumpled the document in frustration, clenching his teeth.
            Even though he had awakened his aura and mastered up to the fifth
            circle of magic, he still felt uncertain about facing Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was how powerful his past self had been. That was how
            formidable his true body was. Additionally, he had failed to steal
            Elucion’s voice from the Demon King. It was also unclear how much of
            the Demon King’s magic had recovered.
          </p>
          <p>He was anxious. Insanely anxious.</p>
          <p>
            As time passed, the Nightmare of the Continent would regain its
            strength. Just as he remembered, or perhaps even worse, it would
            once again turn the continent into hell. Teslon shivered. Knowing
            the future was for him nothing less than horror.
          </p>
          <p>‘I can’t let that dreadful future happen!’</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 88 ]</p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, the Demon King had not yet shown any significant
            movement. It was during this time that all preparations needed to be
            made. He continued to look over the documents, planning and
            replanning for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was then that he sensed someone outside the door. It was a
            familiar presence.
          </p>
          <p>Soon after, a knock sounded, followed by a delicate voice.</p>
          <p>“Teslon, may I come in?”</p>
          <p>Teslon responded with a bright smile.</p>
          <p>“Come in, Philanence.”</p>
          <p>
            The door opened, and a woman dressed in a reddish-brown robe
            entered. Her blonde hair, tinged with red and not quite free of
            freckles, belonged to a woman in her early twenties. She might not
            have been considered a beauty, but she had a rather cute appearance.
            This was Philanence Raigrim, a sorceress who had left the tower of
            Delphia with Teslon.
          </p>
          <p>As Philanence stepped into the room, she tilted her head.</p>
          <p>“Are you looking at that again?”</p>
          <p>
            She looked at Teslon with eyes full of fresh incomprehension. Teslon
            chuckled lightly.
          </p>
          <p>“Haven’t we agreed not to ask about the trivial things?”</p>
          <p>
            His voice was gentle, but the strictness in it stopped any further
            questions. Philanence shrugged her shoulders and nodded.
          </p>
          <p>“Uh, uh-huh.”</p>
          <p>Teslon looked at her with solemn eyes.</p>
          <p>
            This woman had been a classmate and childhood friend of Repenhardt
            since they were young, studying magic together. Even when Teslon was
            revived in this era and treated like a madman, she consistently
            defended him, one of the few reliable people he had in this time.
            Without her help, he would not have had the time to awaken his aura
            within the strict confines of the tower.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It would have been Repenhardt’s friend in the original timeline…’
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, every moment had been turned upside down. Just as Gerard
            of this time was no longer his master, this woman was no longer the
            childhood friend of Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Philanence rolled her innocent eyes, looking intently at Teslon,
            he smiled inwardly.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Demon King Repenhardt. As much as you have taken from me, I have
            also taken from you. And eventually, I will take everything. The
            future will not change!’
          </p>
          <p>
            A cold smile spread across Teslon’s face. Suddenly, Philanence broke
            into a broad smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Teslon, when you smile like that, you look just like you used to.”
          </p>
          <p>“Used to?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, when your name was Repenhardt…”</p>
          <p>“You speak strangely.”</p>

          <p>Teslon clicked his tongue and extended his hand.</p>
          <p>“How did the thing I asked for go?”</p>
          <p>
            As if just remembering her errand, Philanence pulled a bundle of
            papers from her sleeve and handed them to Teslon, saying,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, the reputation of Fist King Repenhardt seems to have spread
            widely among the people. Isn’t it fascinating? The same name as you
            when you were young…”
          </p>
          <p>“My name is no longer Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I know. But it’s an interesting coincidence, isn’t it?”</p>
          <p>“…Not really amusing.”</p>
          <p>Shaking his head, Teslon took the documents.</p>
          <p>
            It had been about a month since the Golden Knight Eusus had explored
            the ruins of Elucion. In the Kingdom of Graim, new rumors were
            rampant. It was whispered that the Golden Knight, who was believed
            to have achieved a great feat, had in fact suffered a
            near-humiliating defeat at the hands of a new Aura wielder.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rumor, although spread deliberately by other families envious of
            the growth of the House of Eusus von Tenes, could not be stopped by
            them either. After all, it wasn’t just a false rumor but the truth
            itself. The fact that the magical armor Eldrad was shattered and
            witnessed by more than a few people meant that it couldn’t be
            silenced just by keeping mouths shut.
          </p>
          <p>
            People who love rumors are always thrilled by the emergence of a new
            hero. As high as the reputation of the Golden Knight Eusus had been,
            so too was the reputation of Repenhardt bound to rise. People were
            already calling him the new Fist King, succeeding Gerard, and
            praising him.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Teslon examined the documents, Philanence Raigrim pursed her
            lips.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Honestly, I don’t understand why this new Fist King is gaining such
            a reputation for what he did.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When you think about it, he’s just someone who barged into someone
            else’s house and when he couldn’t steal, he destroyed everything. I
            really can’t see where there’s anything in that behavior to praise.
          </p>
          <p>But Teslon’s response was as if it were natural.</p>
          <p>“Strength alone has a way of captivating people.”</p>
          <p>
            In fact, the sect of Gym Unbreakable had a history of foolishly
            building up a reputation, so everyone just accepted it. In his
            previous life, Teslon too had gained a reputation by beating
            everyone he faced, not that he intended to kill them, but they often
            ended up dead as a result of the fights… Anyway, Teslon did not live
            morally to earn his reputation. And people tend not to care when the
            strong are unjustly treated, but they criticize when the weak are
            wronged.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, and have you met Sir Eusus?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yes, as you instructed, I delivered the letter and he agreed to
            meet immediately.”
          </p>
          <p>“And the response?”</p>
          <p>
            Philanence pulled out another letter from her possession and smiled
            as she handed it over.
          </p>
          <p>“Just as Teslon expected.”</p>
          <p>“Of course.”</p>
          <p>With a triumphant smile, Teslon received the letter.</p>
          <p>
            ‘A knight could not live without washing away such humiliation.’
          </p>

          <p>
            To wash away the disgraceful dishonor, Eusus saw no other way than
            to have a rematch with Repenhardt and bring him to his knees.
            However, Eusus’s current strength, the magical armor Eldrad, while
            quick to gain power, also had clear limits. Having wielded the power
            of Eldrad to its limits and still lost, there was no way for Eusus
            to face Repenhardt again.
          </p>
          <p>The letter Teslon sent to Eusus was simple.</p>
          <p>-If you want to defeat him, follow me.</p>
          <p>As the letter unfolded, a single phrase was neatly written.</p>
          <p>-I will follow.</p>
          <p>Philanence cautiously continued speaking.</p>
          <p>
            “I did as you asked, gave him the location. He said he’d sort out
            his affairs and come by soon.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, good work, thank you.”</p>
          <p>“Uh, uhh.”</p>
          <p>
            Her face flushed with the praise. The light brimming in her eyes
            clearly showed the affection Philanence held for Teslon.
          </p>
          <p>Teslon felt a slight pang of guilt.</p>
          <p>‘Philanence…’</p>
          <p>
            His soul was far from young. He was old enough to recognize that
            this young woman was in love with him. However, Teslon knew he did
            not deserve to return that love.
          </p>
          <p>
            The person she loved was this body, Repenhardt, not Teslon who had
            traveled back in time and taken over the body… It wasn’t for any
            romantic reasons, of course.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Teslon had become quite intelligent recently, he was
            fundamentally a disciple of Gym Unbreakable. He was the rightful
            successor to the sect known for being the strongest, the best, and
            the most foolishly powerful. How could someone like him entertain
            such sweet thoughts?
          </p>
          <p>
            To Teslon, love meant ‘an act of gloriously pressing with one’s hot
            muscles and sowing excellent seeds to produce strong offspring!’
            Marriage? He did not entertain such a conventional concept. Why
            restrict his excellent seeds to one woman when he could spread them
            among many? That would be a sin against humanity!
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s a mindset that might appall many women, but in his past life,
            Teslon could quite easily sway many with such a philosophy.
            Surprisingly, there seemed to be plenty of women in the world who
            didn’t care about what was inside a man’s head as long as he had a
            thick chest and clear six-pack abs.
          </p>
          <p>Normally, Teslon would have taken Philanence by now…</p>
          <p>
            ‘I’m sorry, Philanence. If it were my true body, I would have sown
            my seeds without hesitation, but to do so in this feeble body would
            be an insult to you.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, Teslon was sincerely feeling sorry for Philanence. Perhaps
            even a macho man has his own kind of conscience? It was a way of
            thinking completely detached from understanding the emotions of
            women. Everything in the world has its reasons, and this is why he
            was known as a macho man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless of his true feelings, Teslon’s outward demeanor was quite
            gentlemanly. With a somewhat regretful expression, Philanence
            suddenly seemed to remember something and spoke up.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, and there was someone who fits the description Teslon was
            talking about.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides the recent report, Teslon had given Philanence another task.
            He had asked her to find someone who held a grudge against
            Repenhardt and had enough influence and martial power to potentially
            become an ally. Although he had formed connections with various
            ‘strong reserve forces,’ none were suitable allies to kill
            Repenhardt due to a lack of justification. Claiming that one should
            kill him because he would become a demon lord in the future would
            certainly make one seem mad…
          </p>
          <p>Teslon’s eyes lit up.</p>
          <p>“Really? Who?”</p>

          <p>
            “Stefan von Altion. The second son of the Altion family of the
            Vasily Kingdom.”
          </p>
          <p>“Never heard of him.”</p>
          <p>
            Teslon frowned slightly. In the future he remembered, there was no
            one named Stefan among the powerful. This meant, in essence, he was
            worthless (or so he thought). However, since there were no suitable
            candidates currently to face the demon lord…
          </p>
          <p>‘If he’s not suitable, I’ll make him suitable.’</p>
          <p>Deciding firmly, Teslon asked,</p>
          <p>“Where is this Stefan now?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>The harsh sun relentlessly scorched the earth.</p>
          <p>
            Endless expanses of sand and rock, heated by the midday sun, caused
            the air itself to boil and shimmer. Looking around, nothing could be
            seen but the vast, heat-stricken landscape. In the midst of this
            majestic desert, there was a single shade.
          </p>
          <p>
            A large rock, shaped strangely by the weathering of ages, and from
            its dark shadow, suddenly, a loud explosion echoed.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Smoke rose, and fragments of rock scattered in all directions. Soon
            after, shadows of people emerged from within the shade. A young man
            with a sturdy physique and a slender woman walked out.
          </p>
          <p>The woman looked around with a face of disbelief and muttered,</p>
          <p>“…Really… this is indeed the land of lamentation…”</p>
          <p>
            The young man shrugged his shoulders and spoke with an air of
            arrogance.
          </p>
          <p>“Didn’t I tell you I’d be here soon?”</p>
          <p>
            As soon as Repenhardt had resolved to take Siris back to her
            homeland, he immediately gathered water and food and headed to the
            temple at Al Fort, located to the west of Grand Forge. It was there,
            amidst the semi-ruined temple, that Siris wore a face of utter
            incomprehension.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Repenhardt clasped his hands together and began to chant a
            long spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Haji home zigor hutovatia, I am the bound one, granted rights by
            the marks, receiving the name of the worthy to control the flows…”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was an exceedingly long spell. Siris began to feel bored by its
            length when suddenly, Repenhardt formed complex hand signs and
            shouted the activation word.
          </p>
          <p>“Before me, open the void! Althas Daiman Portal Vitality!”</p>
          <p>
            A sudden whirlwind of light emerged, and while Siris wore a dazed
            expression, Repenhardt quickly grabbed her hand and jumped into the
            vortex. When she regained her senses, Siris realized she was no
            longer in Grand Forge. They were in a vast black chamber lined with
            countless pillars, the ruins of Daiman itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris quickly understood what had happened. Just as they had headed
            to Grand Forge, Repenhardt had used the relics of the Silver Age in
            reverse to return to this place, the Daiman Dungeon. Siris turned to
            Repenhardt, her voice filled with surprise.
          </p>
          <p>“Is this portal capable of two-way travel?”</p>
          <p>“Not all of them. Only a few can be activated for travel.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt replied nonchalantly as he walked on. He paused, closely
            examining the ancient script on a pillar, then suddenly waved to
            Siris with excitement.
          </p>
          <p>“Found it, the Tidaen Daiman Portal.”</p>
          <p>
            Originally, the Daiman Dungeon was used during the Silver Age as a
            sort of station. Magical portals were installed across the
            continent, allowing for travel to desired locations via this unique
            transportation method of the era. While most of the system was in
            ruins, a few portals still maintained their functionality in a
            deactivated state.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I researched them extensively, but in the end, only seven portals
            could be activated.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Reflecting on the past, Repenhardt caressed the pillar marked
            ‘Tidaen’ with a nostalgic look. How many different races had he been
            able to transport to the Antares Empire using this ancient relic
            that could instantaneously shift spaces?
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the portals at the opposite destinations had been destroyed
            over the years by human hands, and the surviving portals all led to
            remote areas untouched by humans. Most of the different races hiding
            from slavery lived in such remote places, and it was almost
            inevitable that the portal leading to the Spelrat Desert, where the
            Dahnhaim clan was hiding, remained intact.

          <p>[ Chapter 89 ]</p>
          <p>“Let’s go, Siris.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, yes…”</p>
          <p>
            Still dazed, Siris followed Repenhardt as he activated the Tidaen
            Daiman Portal this time. Passing through the portal, they emerged in
            the underground of a half-collapsed relic from the Silver Age,
            naturally swarming with all sorts of demonic creatures. However,
            Repenhardt, as if it was nothing, promptly activated a side path.
            Soon, a secret passage, devoid of any demons or undead, brazenly
            revealed its entrance, allowing Siris to comfortably exit the midst
            of the Silver Age ruins without a single battle.
          </p>
          <p>“…”</p>
          <p>
            With a lost expression, Siris blankly surveyed her surroundings.
            Just about thirty minutes ago, she was enduring the harsh northern
            winds in the midwinter mountains, and in an instant, the season had
            changed.
          </p>
          <p>
            An endlessly stretching desert and the scorching heat intensely
            beating down from above. The air was stifling.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was undeniable. It was her homeland, the land of wailing, the
            Spelrat Desert.
          </p>
          <p>Siris shook her head in disbelief.</p>
          <p>
            “To activate a relic from the Silver Age would require a very
            high-level sorcerer…”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt humbly downplayed it.</p>
          <p>
            “The magic to activate a portal isn’t that high-level. It’s just
            about rearranging the tangled mana flows into their correct
            sequence. If you know the arrangement method, even a 6th circle
            magic can suffice.”
          </p>
          <p>Still, Siris looked suspicious.</p>
          <p>
            If there’s a key and the strength to turn it, anyone can open a
            door. But making the key oneself requires the skills of a
            professional locksmith, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Having been trained as a slayer in a slave auction house, Siris had
            learned the basic common knowledge about magic. Opening a portal and
            discovering the formula to do so were entirely different matters. A
            portal that a 6th circle practitioner could open would be impossible
            to research and discover the activation formula for unless one were
            a great sorcerer of at least the 8th circle or higher.
          </p>
          <p>“This wasn’t taught by your master, was it?”</p>
          <p>
            There were no rumors that the Fist King Gerard was well-versed in
            magic. Repenhardt responded in a calm tone, as if he had anticipated
            her question.
          </p>
          <p>
            “One of my master’s friends was a sorcerer. Otherwise, where do you
            think I learned magic?”
          </p>
          <p>Siris rolled her eyes.</p>
          <p>‘Something’s fishy…’</p>
          <p>
            If Gerard was the Fist King, it only made sense that a friend who
            was a sorcerer would be a great sorcerer indeed. Thus, it was quite
            plausible that Repenhardt learned magic from this friend.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, there’s nothing to nitpick. It all seems to add up,” Siris
            muttered to herself.
          </p>
          <p>‘But why do I feel so deceived?’</p>
          <p>
            Siris irritably pursed her lips. She tried to accept the
            explanation, but her intuition kept screaming that something was
            off. Yet, she couldn’t quite challenge it…
          </p>
          <p>“Fine!”</p>
          <p>
            With a defiant response, Siris stepped out from under the shadow of
            the rock. The hot sun intensely beat down on her smooth brown skin.
            However, Siris seemed to enjoy it. It was a harsh sunlight, but one
            that brought a sense of longing.
          </p>
          <p>As Siris strode ahead, Repenhardt sighed.</p>
          <p>‘Why is she upset again?’</p>
          <p>
            Ah, whether in a past life or this one, understanding the hearts of
            women is beyond me! Once I regain all my magical powers, I might
            just have to create a 10th circle spell that ‘deciphers’ the hearts
            of women.
          </p>
          <p>
            With this ambitious (?) plan in mind, Repenhardt shook his head and
            followed Siris.
          </p>

          <p>
            As they broke through the sand, a creature over two meters tall
            bared its teeth at them.
          </p>
          <p>“Kaaa!”</p>
          <p>
            A sand lizard, covered in pale yellow scales reminiscent of a
            crocodile, known as a Sandrizard, emerged. Its powerful jaws could
            crush rocks and its tail had enough force to kill a cow or horse in
            one strike, making it a monster feared by the nomads of the desert.
          </p>
          <p>“But for now, it’s just my lunch.”</p>
          <p>
            Smirking, Repenhardt calmly watched the Sandrizard charge at him.
            Then, as the tail came flying towards him, he reached out his hand
            and simply caught it.
          </p>
          <p>“Kwing?”</p>
          <p>
            A human catching its tail swipe with bare hands? The Sandrizard was
            taken aback by this unprecedented situation, its eyes widening in
            shock. Repenhardt then lifted his hand. Despite the Sandrizard’s
            stature of over two meters, Repenhardt stood at an impressive 192
            centimeters. Raising his hand, the Sandrizard dangled helplessly in
            the air. Just as the audacious human stunned it, and it was about to
            spit its venom…
          </p>
          <p>Thump!</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt slammed the Sandrizard to the ground. The ground being
            sand rather than rock meant that it didn’t die from a single blow.
            But that was just a start. Repenhardt, as if doing laundry,
            repeatedly slammed the Sandrizard into the ground. The Sandrizard
            tried to struggle to live, but it was futile.
          </p>
          <p>
            What kind of human is immune to venom and impervious to bites, and
            in the midst of all this, consciousness fading…
          </p>
          <p>“Kwe…”</p>
          <p>
            With a modest cry, the Sandrizard ended its troubled life.
            Repenhardt turned to Siris with a broad smile.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris, let’s eat before we go!”</p>
          <p>
            A typical woman might have been dismayed by this foolish spectacle.
            However, Siris, who called the desert her homeland, had been
            excitedly looking forward to eating sandrizard, a treat she hadn’t
            had in a long time. The expression she wore didn’t quite seem one an
            elf would make, yet it was oddly natural.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ll peel the skin,” she offered.</p>
          <p>“Okay, I’ll start the fire.”</p>
          <p>
            An impromptu camping session was set up in the middle of the desert.
            It might have been too warm for a picnic, but it was not a problem
            for the two of them.
          </p>
          <p>“Barrier of Dark!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt cast a shadow barrier above them, quickly creating a cool
            shade.
          </p>
          <p>“Flame Field!”</p>
          <p>
            He laid down a small flame field on the ground, allowing them to
            start a fire right on the sand.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt cast his spells, Siris expertly skinned the sandrizard
            and drained its blood. She didn’t discard the blood; instead, she
            used the peeled skin as a container to store it. In the desert,
            water was precious and not to be wasted carelessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Siris chopped the sandrizard into suitable pieces for cooking,
            Repenhardt cast another spell on the blood-filled skin container.
          </p>
          <p>“Aqua Drain.”</p>
          <p>
            He applied a moisture extraction spell to the sandrizard’s blood,
            separating it into blood curds and clean water. This secured their
            water supply for the desert journey, showcasing that magic was often
            more effective for practical purposes than combat.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, to think I hadn’t used such convenient magic until now…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was impressed with his own efficiency as he watched the
            sizzling sandrizard meat. The meat crackled, dripping fat and
            emitting a delicious aroma that tantalized the nose. Siris seemed
            much happier than before, probably feeling nostalgic for her
            homeland.
          </p>
          <p>She even offered some meat to Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>
            “Would you like to try some, Repenhardt? See if it’s cooked well.”
          </p>
          <p>“Sure! Yes!”</p>

          <p>
            It was delicious! How could the meat lovingly fed by a loved one
            taste bad? Repenhardt eagerly accepted, and for a moment, Siris
            smiled, though she soon returned to her usual cool demeanor.
            However, her expression was noticeably more relaxed than before.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two enjoyed their lively lunch. Midway through chewing,
            Repenhardt asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Siris, how much further to your hometown?”</p>
          <p>
            He actually knew the location, but couldn’t act as if he did. Siris
            paused to observe the surrounding terrain and feel the wind.
          </p>
          <p>
            True to her elven nature, she didn’t need to look at the stars like
            humans did; she instinctively sensed the spirits in the atmosphere
            to approximate their current location. After determining where they
            were, she nodded.
          </p>
          <p>“About half a day’s walk toward the setting sun.”</p>
          <p>
            It had been nearly 50 years since she had last seen her hometown.
            Although she tried not to show it, anticipation was evident in her
            eyes. But then Siris realized something. The land might remain, but
            the people wouldn’t be the same.
          </p>
          <p>“Of course, none of them would have survived…”</p>
          <p>
            Her voice faltered, and she hunched her shoulders. Repenhardt spoke
            kindly to her.
          </p>
          <p>“You never know how things might turn out, right?”</p>
          <p>“…?”</p>
          <p>
            Sensing that he might know something, Siris tilted her head
            curiously.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Half a day later, Repenhardt and Siris arrived at the Dahnhaim
            clan’s village. Siris looked around in silence, at a loss for words.
          </p>
          <p>“……”</p>
          <p>
            Beneath the sandy dunes, primitive huts made of blackthorn
            intertwined haphazardly, and beside them, a modest oasis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Compared to human villages, it looked more like an animal’s den,
            dilapidated and ramshackle. This was the current state of the
            once-noble High Elves, heralded in distant past times as descendants
            of a great spirit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris gazed at the huts with a nostalgic look. No signs of life
            could be felt anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>‘Indeed…….’</p>
          <p>
            Underneath the fragile blackthorn roofs that seemed ready to
            collapse at any moment, wooden dishes filled with sand dust were
            visible. They were all crudely made, seeming as if they might
            crumble with the slightest touch.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a sorrowful smile, Siris knelt and touched them, hallucinating
            voices from her memories.
          </p>
          <p>-Our daughter, ……. You too must grow up and protect our clan.</p>
          <p>-Well done. That’s how you must swing the sword. …….</p>
          <p>-Look at this, ……! Now I can help Father too!</p>
          <p>
            Voices of numerous elves filled her ears, memories of all her
            fathers, mothers, and the young elves she had played with echoing
            alongside her recollections. Like a dam bursting, her memory
            endlessly spouted reminiscences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris tightly closed her eyes. The dry desert wind blew under the
            eaves, shifting the gritty sand.
          </p>
          <p>‘Now, they’re all gone…….’</p>
          <p>
            A flood of memories harshly lacerated her heart, leaving behind
            traces of devastation. Her heart ached, as if pierced by hundreds of
            needles.
          </p>
          <p>Siris kept her eyes closed. Regret washed over her.</p>
          <p>‘Why did I come here…….’</p>

          <p>
            If she hadn’t come, if she hadn’t seen, if she hadn’t remembered,
            perhaps this pain wouldn’t exist.
          </p>
          <p>
            But once surfaced, memories turned into cruel waves, endlessly
            crashing at her ears.
          </p>
          <p>-Look at this, ……!</p>
          <p>Suddenly, she realized.</p>
          <p>There was something she couldn’t remember.</p>
          <p>
            -Let’s go together, ……! Today we’re going to catch desert scorpions!
          </p>
          <p>
            Even now, as the faces of her parents, the voices of her friends,
            and the breath and scent of her beloved siblings vividly surfaced,
            there remained an unrecalled memory.
          </p>
          <p>The voice that used to call her.</p>
          <p>-……!</p>
          <p>She couldn’t remember that name.</p>
          <p>
            The name she used to be called by everyone, the name she was known
            by, she could not remember.
          </p>
          <p>Bang!</p>
          <p>
            Siris punched down nervously, shattering the wooden bowl she was
            holding. But no matter how angry she got, what she wanted did not
            come to mind.
          </p>
          <p>“Sigh…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris sighed. She felt like crying her heart out, but no tears came.
          </p>
          <p>Her tears had stopped 50 years ago.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Repenhardt was looking around in confusion.</p>
          <p>“Huh? What happened here?”</p>
          <p>
            He clearly remembered. In his past life, when he had visited this
            place, the Dahnhaim clan was still intact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite living a tough life, these pure-blooded High Elves had
            steadfastly preserved the teachings of their ancestors. Repenhardt
            remembered them clearly.
          </p>
          <p>Where on earth had they gone?</p>
          <p>“Why is no one here?”</p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt was bewildered, he saw Siris sighing in despair. This
            was not the scene he had hoped for. He had brought her here wanting
            to meet the surviving clan members and see her smile brightly. It
            was not his intention to make her this sad.
          </p>
          <p>“Could it be…?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt frantically looked around.</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, he felt a chill. Could it be that because of his
            regression to this era, the Dahnhaim clan, which should have
            survived, had been destroyed? It might seem like a leap, but
            causality can bring about tremendous consequences from even the
            slightest distortion. It wasn’t entirely out of the realm of
            possibility.
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t think I did anything that distorted…”</p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt looked around anxiously, something suddenly struck
            him. There was something odd about this ruined village.
          </p>
          <p>“Odd? What’s odd?”</p>
          <p>He pondered and soon found the answer.</p>
          <p>Repenhardt called out to Siris with a relieved expression.</p>
          <p>“Siris!”</p>
          <p>“…Yes?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris turned her head listlessly to look at Repenhardt, her
            expression scolding him as if to say, what are you so excited about
            when I’m nearly dead tired?
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt pointed around and asked her.</p>
          <p>“Doesn’t something about this village seem strange to you?”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 90 ]</p>
          <p>“Have you ever seen a ruined village before?”</p>
          <p>Siris retorted sharply. Repenhardt shook his head.</p>
          <p>“No! Doesn’t this village feel off somehow?”</p>
          <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
          <p>
            “Siris, you said that the Dahnhaim clan perished 50 years ago,
            right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s insensitivity in dredging up painful memories was just
            about to trigger Siris’s anger.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So you’re saying this village has been in this state for 50 years?”
          </p>
          <p>“…What?”</p>
          <p>Only then did Siris light up and stand up abruptly.</p>
          <p>
            It indeed seemed odd. Fifty years were enough for landscapes to
            change five times over. Moreover, this was the notorious Spelrat
            Desert. Even majestic rock formations would have eroded into quaint
            rocks by now.
          </p>
          <p>
            And yet, this village made of charred wood had remained a ruin for
            50 years?
          </p>
          <p>
            That made no sense. If truly the Dahnhaim clan had been annihilated
            50 years ago, nothing but sand should remain here.
          </p>
          <p>“Now that I think about it…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris suddenly snapped back to reality and hastily placed her hand
            on the ground. Upon closer inspection, it was clear.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was evident! The village had been abandoned for no more than two
            weeks at most!
          </p>
          <p>“What in the world…”</p>
          <p>
            Panic-stricken, Siris muttered. Could it be that after the Dahnhaim
            clan perished, others had settled here? However, the style of the
            huts and the dinnerware too distinctly bore the Dahnhaim signature.
            It appeared as if her family had been living here until recently.
          </p>
          <p>Her family, whom she thought had all died…</p>
          <p>“Are they actually alive…?”</p>

          <p>
            As Siris murmured dazedly, she suddenly turned her head. A faint
            voice had reached her.
          </p>
          <p>“…are you…”</p>
          <p>“Why, Siris?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, with his superior aura-user hearing, which was even
            better than Siris’s elven senses, was puzzled by her behavior. She
            had heard something he hadn’t?
          </p>
          <p>
            Shaking her head, Siris thought it might have been a hallucination
            when suddenly:
          </p>
          <p>“…come help…”</p>
          <p>
            The voice sounded again. Still distant, yet clearer, as if
            resonating not with her ears but her soul.
          </p>
          <p>“Please help…”</p>
          <p>It was the voice of her kin.</p>
          <p>
            Siris abruptly stood up. Her sword Nihillen vibrated slightly at her
            waist. As if bewitched, she drew her blade. Repenhardt looked on
            bewildered.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris? Why the sword all of a sudden?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris dug her feet into the sand. Her well-trained, resilient legs
            forcefully propelled the light elf body forward. Thus, Siris began
            sprinting across the village, and in a flash, she was running beyond
            its limits towards the distant desert.
          </p>
          <p>“…Siris?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The blistering sun hammered down on the desert, and beneath it,
            about forty armed men trudged along the path. Each of them had a
            menacing look, with faces full of scars and unkempt beards, giving
            off the impression that they might as well have “I’m a villain”
            written across their faces. It seemed as if they had taken too much
            responsibility for their faces at the age of forty, as their lives
            appeared unscrupulously led.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trailing behind the group were three elves, bound by ropes,
            struggling to move forward. Among them was a beautiful elf woman, a
            young boy, and a girl. Their clothes were ragged, almost tattered,
            and they barely managed to breathe through parched lips, their
            expressions filled with despair.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the men in the middle pulled a leather flask from his pocket
            and took large gulps. He then cursed aloud.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, damn it. Hey! Move faster!”</p>
          <p>The young elf girl stumbled at his outburst, groaning softly.</p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>
            Her delicate, immature body rolled on the scorching sands of the
            desert. It was a pitiful sight, but no one around her harbored any
            sympathy. Instead, a man prepared to whip her out of his pouch.
          </p>

          <p>The elf woman spoke in a strained voice.</p>
          <p>“Get up, Netina. Don’t show weakness to them.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Shailen sister.”</p>
          <p>
            Even in pain, the girl did not cry. She trembled but gathered
            herself up again, her eyes filled with venom. The man about to whip
            her withdrew it, his expression soured, and he muttered grudgingly.
          </p>
          <p>“What are they babbling about?”</p>
          <p>
            Their conversation in Elvish was incomprehensible to the men, and
            they had no desire to understand. To them, these ‘wild animals’
            might as well say whatever they wanted—it wasn’t for humans like
            them to care.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man continued to grumble as he led the elves across the desert.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it, all this trouble and this is all we get?”</p>
          <p>A bald man next to him tried to console him.</p>
          <p>
            “Bright brother, maybe we can still make some money by selling
            these?”
          </p>
          <p>“Idiot! Think about the cost of getting here; we’re at a loss!”</p>
          <p>
            Bright snapped irritably at the man and then took another sip from
            his flask, clicking his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Damn, missing good opportunities and crawling all the way here…
            This still doesn’t make any money. Life sure is tough.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Bright was originally a mercenary affiliated with the arena in
            Chrome City, located near the Rakid Mountains in the eastern part of
            the Vasily Kingdom. The job at the arena was frankly uneventful. His
            main duties involved quelling disturbances among the spectators or,
            on the rare occasion, capturing runaway slaves. It was a leisurely
            and well-paid life, satisfying in its simplicity.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, those good times came to an abrupt end a few years ago when
            he was ruthlessly dismissed from the arena after failing a mission.
          </p>
          <p>
            Typically, even as a mercenary, one would not be so easily dismissed
            for failing a mission or two. However, the problem was that the
            mission was really trivial. It was merely about capturing a runaway
            orc slave. Bright himself was convinced that the task, though
            bothersome, was not difficult, and it was natural for everyone else
            to view it the same way.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Everything started to go wrong after I met that hick from the
            mountains….”
          </p>
          <p>
            Recalling that time, Bright ground his teeth in frustration. While
            chasing the orc slave in the mountains, he encountered a burly
            villager because of whom he lost the orc slave and nearly became a
            cripple. He was truly amazed at their mental strength when they
            returned to Chrome City in such a state, supporting each other as if
            they were on some rugged expedition.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bright and his men were beaten so badly that they spent the next six
            months lying down. When they finally managed to get up, they had
            already become the laughingstock of Chrome City.
          </p>
          <p>
            People did not believe Bright’s story that they had encountered a
            hermit in the mountains and ended up in such a state. Naturally,
            they believed he had lost the orc slave and made up a story.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, they mocked him for how poorly crafted his lie was,
            typical of a brute. Because Bright had candidly claimed, “That guy,
            his muscles were so tough that even a blade couldn’t penetrate him!”
            People scoffed at the notion of a body impervious to blades, arguing
            that only an aura user could have such a trait, and why would an
            aura user bother to help an orc slave escape?
          </p>

          <p>
            Ultimately, unable to secure any work, Bright and his party were
            forced to relocate to another country, where they continued to
            receive poor treatment. There, their misfortunes persisted, often
            losing clients or failing missions. Eventually, they became slave
            hunters, leading them to this godforsaken desert.
          </p>
          <p>GPT</p>
          <p>“Ah, it’s unbearably hot. Really…”</p>
          <p>
            Continuously fanning himself, Bright cast resentful glances at the
            sun above. He then shouted ahead.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, Kronto! Don’t you have some magic to cool things down?”</p>
          <p>The middle-aged man riding a camel replied irritably.</p>
          <p>“No! Do you think magic can do everything?”</p>
          <p>
            Responding abruptly in informal speech, the magician, Kronto, then
            pulled his robe’s hood over his head and urged his camel forward.
            Bright watched him enviously. Initially, upon seeing Kronto wear
            such a robe even in the desert, Bright had mocked, ‘As if anyone
            needed proof he’s a wizard, sticking to that attire even here?’ But
            once they were actually in the desert, it turned out that the robe
            was surprisingly suitable for keeping cool, at least shielding him
            from this hellish sunlight.
          </p>
          <p>“All the money spent, and I hired this gentleman too…”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing Kronto again made Bright’s blood boil. He frowned deeply.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had been overjoyed when he first heard there was a wild elf tribe
            in the Spelrat Desert. Capturing just twenty ordinary female elves
            could have turned his life around. With that money, he could have
            opened a respectable tavern and settled down with a widow to enjoy a
            comfortable retirement.
          </p>
          <p>
            So, he had spent his entire fortune preparing for this hunt. He
            bought equipment and supplies, hired mercenaries to fill out his
            forces, and even summoned a magician when he was short on money. The
            magician, a high-ranking practitioner of the 6th Circle, had
            commanded an exorbitant fee. Bright had scraped together every last
            bit of his and his subordinates’ pocket money to afford it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, he had risked everything to come here. Initially, it seemed
            like things were going well. Magician Kronto had successfully
            located the elf tribe in the vast desert, and they had managed to
            raid the tribe under the cover of night. The elves numbered barely
            two hundred, a force that forty battle-hardened mercenaries could
            easily trample, especially with a magician on their side. At that
            moment, visions of gold and treasure danced before their eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem arose afterward. The elves, despite being attacked in
            the middle of the night, were alarmingly quick and organized in
            their response.
          </p>
          <p>
            The males, wielding swords, guarded the front while the females
            operated traps and shot arrows from behind. Suddenly, the elderly
            and children evacuated in perfect unison, vanishing into the
            distance. Such precision in their evacuation could only be
            attributed to rigorous training, an enigma as to why these wild
            beings would undergo such preparations. Had they been attacked in
            this manner before?
          </p>
          <p>
            Thanks to the chaos, all that Bright acquired were a few elf
            corpses, two children who had failed to escape, and a single elf
            woman who stayed behind to protect them. The rest had vanished
            without a trace, leaving not even a footprint behind, and not even
            Kronto’s magic could detect them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, the heavens are indeed indifferent! Why must things always go
            awry when one tries so hard to live well?”
          </p>
          <p>
            While some indulged in luxury from an inherited elf auction house,
            Bright cursed his luck, having roamed the desert extensively without
            striking fortune—a truly resentful sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unable to bear Bright’s constant grumbling, one of his subordinates
            tried to console him.
          </p>
          <p>“At least it wasn’t a total loss, right? We caught three…”</p>
          <p>“Young ones barely fetch any money!” Bright retorted.</p>
          <p>
            Elves, known for their lengthy maturation period, were not lucrative
            in auctions if young; these elf children, appearing merely eleven or
            twelve in human years, would take at least thirty years to reach a
            profitable age. Consequently, few welcomed young elves at the slave
            markets.
          </p>
          <p>“Moreover, one of them is a male!”</p>
          <p>
            Bright snapped, frustrated. Male elves fetched only a tenth of the
            price of females, and adult wild male elves had such high s*****e
            rates that buyers generally avoided them. At least the young one
            might be used for breeding, selling for a meager price.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, how much could we possibly get for these?”</p>
          <p>
            Bright pondered as he eyed the following elf woman. Selling her as
            she was would result in a deficit. However, she seemed skilled with
            a sword, having carefully observed her as she wielded a crude blade
            to protect the youngsters. Although just an elf slave, she could
            potentially break even if sold as a prospective slayer.
