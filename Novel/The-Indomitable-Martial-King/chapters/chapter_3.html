          <p>[ Chapter 21 ]</p>
          <p>
            The goat-headed demon shook its head, discharging blue lightning
            between its curved horns. As the demon writhed, crimson flames
            sprang up around it, scattering a scorching heat. Black smoke
            billowed incessantly from the sword in its right hand.
          </p>
          <p>“Kooooh!”</p>
          <p>
            A monster famous for its massive size, even larger than an ogre, was
            spewing dark-red demonic energy without restraint. The demonic
            energy was so tangible that it could be seen with the naked eye. As
            the demonic aura washed over Stefan and his companions like a tidal
            wave, they all screamed.
          </p>
          <p>“Eek!”</p>
          <p>“Aaagh!”</p>
          <p>
            Being wrapped in the horrifying demonic energy, fear instinctively
            arose. Sillan quickly prayed, protecting the minds of his
            companions. Thanks to him, they did not fall into panic, but they
            all retreated in fear. The orc slaves had already fainted, foaming
            at the mouth, and even knights like Todd were barely holding onto
            their consciousness. Sillan, being a conduit of divine power and
            thus more resistant to fear, was still clattering his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>Stefan cried out in horror.</p>
          <p>“Grelbeast!”</p>
          <p>
            The demon blocking their escape was one of the highest-ranking
            demons among the otherworldly monsters. Upon closer inspection,
            chains of light bound its limbs, connected to a magic circle behind
            the stairs. Thanks to this, the Grelbeast was unable to attack
            Stefan and his group, only howling in rage.
          </p>
          <p>Sir Edward assessed the situation and exclaimed.</p>
          <p>“Argh! Was this demon the guardian of this place?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt frowned.</p>
          <p>‘Huh? Why is it here?’</p>
          <p>
            Ruins from the Silver Age, broken by dimensional rifts, occasionally
            attract beings from other dimensions with their powerful magic,
            absorbing them into their defense systems. Originally, this magical
            function was meant to supplement any deficiencies in the system
            itself, but a malfunction had instead captured an ‘otherworldly
            monster’ to fill its place.
          </p>
          <p>
            To ordinary explorers of the Silver Age ruins, these beings guarding
            the ruins were feared as ‘dungeon guardians,’ but Repenhardt knew
            the truth. These creatures, in fact, were rather pitiful beings,
            kidnapped and forced to work without pay.
          </p>
          <p>‘There wasn’t such a creature here last time I came.’</p>
          <p>Suddenly, his expression hardened.</p>
          <p>‘Ah, this is the time period before it has been defeated!’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt pondered for a moment. Should they push through as is?
            This demon was no easy foe. Merged with the ruin’s system, the demon
            became a being far more powerful than ordinary monsters. A Grelbeast
            itself was a much higher-ranking demon than a Tagrel, and now as a
            guardian, it was emitting even more terrifying demonic energy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, this demon was the one that had killed Sir Claude, a
            former Aura User, in the past. The extent of the difference in skill
            between himself and Sir Claude was unknown, but the mere fact that
            the demon had awakened its Aura meant it was not an opponent to be
            taken lightly.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            After a brief moment of contemplation, Repenhardt cleanly decided to
            abandon this path.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was nothing of value to gain from confronting the demon. If
            necessary, they could simply exit the way they had entered. Unlike
            the first and second underground levels, this area had been
            personally explored by them, so they were well-versed in the
            conditions and locations of the monsters. If they played their cards
            right, they could return to the surface without engaging in a single
            battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s turn back. It’s too difficult to face this creature with our
            current strength.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Seeing Repenhardt suddenly revert to formal speech, Edward was
            puzzled. Why the change in attitude? Regardless, now was not the
            time to worry about such matters. As a knight of vast experience,
            Sir Edward could feel that the demon’s presence was extraordinary.
            The demonic energy it emitted was palpably different from that of a
            Beiter or Tagrel. Even Stefan, who usually acted without regard for
            the consequences, suggested looking for another exit.
          </p>
          <p>
            For the first time, Repenhardt and Stefan’s group were in agreement.
            They were all ready to turn back when one of the knights, failing to
            read the room, shouted out.
          </p>
          <p>“Your Highness, look at the sword that demon is holding!”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Stefan, puzzled, turned to where his subordinate was pointing. At
            that moment, he saw the longsword held by the Grelbeast and
            exclaimed in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“The magic sword, Altion!”</p>
          <p>
            The jewel decorating the blade, the intricate craftsmanship, and the
            delicate blade forged from mithril. Despite continuously emitting
            black smoke, it was unmistakably the treasured sword of the Altion
            family.
          </p>
          <p>Stefan stopped in his tracks.</p>
          <p>
            They had finally found what they had been so desperately seeking.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh…!”</p>
          <p>
            Without hesitation, Stefan drew his sword and assumed a battle
            stance. Sir Edward, surprised, asked.
          </p>
          <p>“Your Highness? Are you planning to confront that demon?”</p>
          <p>“Of course, isn’t it obvious?”</p>
          <p>“But…”</p>
          <p>
            Sir Edward looked back at the Grelbeast. The demonic energy was
            still formidable. They were only safe because of the chains. Had the
            demon been free, they were certain they would have been annihilated
            in an instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The opponent is too strong. Now that we’ve located it, perhaps we
            should return to the family and gather more forces?”
          </p>
          <p>
            In response to the loyal concern for his lord’s safety, Stefan
            snapped angrily.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What are you saying? Do you intend to simply watch as the sword of
            a great knight is defiled in the hands of that demon!?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Stefan’s eyes blazed with determination. Return to the family with
            nothing to show? If they did that, the glory would no longer be his.
            Only by returning here and now with that cursed sword in hand could
            he truly grasp honor and glory! There was no turning back.
          </p>
          <p>It was impossible to leave things as they were.</p>
          <p>The sword must be reclaimed.</p>
          <p>Even if it meant reaching into the clutches of certain death!</p>
          <p>“Everyone, draw your swords!”</p>
          <p>
            His commanding voice brooked no dissent among the knights. The
            knights hesitated. Cowards, all of them! Stefan cursed inwardly as
            he continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That monster is chained. If it gets dangerous, we can retreat
            beyond its range of safety. Are you telling me you’re so cowardly
            that you’re afraid of an opponent that’s bound?”
          </p>

          <p>
            Though blinded by greed, Stefan was still a competent knight. He
            recognized that the demon’s movements were limited by its chains.
            That meant they weren’t entirely without a chance!
          </p>
          <p>
            Spurred by their lord’s call, the knights gathered courage. They
            readied themselves for battle, while Repenhardt tried to dissuade
            Edward.
          </p>
          <p>“Look, do you really intend to fight that monster?”</p>
          <p>
            Even if the demon was bound, lives could be snuffed out in the blink
            of an eye once combat began. Did he think the demon would give them
            a chance to run away upon recognizing the danger?
          </p>
          <p>“There’s no chance of winning. Everyone might die.”</p>
          <p>
            Yet, the knights’ resolve was unshaken. Edward looked pensively at
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We appreciate your help. But in the end, you’re just a barbarian
            who knows nothing of honor.”
          </p>
          <p>He muttered indifferently.</p>
          <p>
            “There are things in this world more important than life itself.”
          </p>
          <p>‘No, I’m saying it’s impossible to beat it.’</p>
          <p>
            They couldn’t even handle a Tagrel, how were they supposed to
            confront this? They really wouldn’t listen to reason.
          </p>
          <p>Stefan raised his sword and yelled at the knights.</p>
          <p>
            “Knights of Altion. Show your bravery at the risk of your lives.”
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaah!”</p>
          <p>“Magician Todd, prepare for support!”</p>
          <p>
            Todd began concentrating magic in his hands. Seemingly regaining his
            courage now that he could stay at a safe distance and cast spells,
            the magician seemed ready.
          </p>
          <p>“Priests of Philanence, may the Goddess’s blessing be upon us!”</p>
          <p>
            Convinced by Stefan’s words, Sillan began to pray with a brave face.
            The knights were enveloped in the Goddess’s blessing, and a powerful
            magical protection settled upon their armor. In this fortified
            state, they courageously charged towards the Grelbeast.
          </p>
          <p>“Be gone, you wicked demon!”</p>
          <p>
            And Repenhardt stepped back, clicking his tongue in resignation.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, there they go, just as I warned…’</p>
          <p>“Uooooh!”</p>
          <p>
            With a valorous shout, a knight charged forward. Chained, the
            Grelbeast swung its massive arm in a simple but wide-reaching
            motion. The knight, unable to dodge in time, was struck squarely.
          </p>
          <p>Crash!</p>
          <p>
            With a loud clanging sound, the momentum of the charge sent the
            knight flying backward, bouncing off the ground.
          </p>

          <p>‘Oh dear, there goes another one.’</p>
          <p>
            Hidden in a corner of the chamber, Repenhardt watched the knights
            with a pitiful gaze. The fallen knight groaned as he picked himself
            up. His armor was battered and dented, but it still retained its
            shape relatively well. This was less due to the quality of the armor
            and more to Sillan’s divine protection.
          </p>
          <p>“You beast!”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing his comrade fall, another knight charged forward with his
            shield raised, aiming for the Grelbeast’s back. It seemed futile.
            Detecting the approach, the demon whipped its thick tail like a
            spear, striking the knight’s shield. The shield cracked, and this
            knight too was sent flying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his cheek with a look of ‘I knew this would
            happen.’
          </p>
          <p>‘They’re just getting pounded.’</p>
          <p>
            Despite his expectations, Stefan and the other knights were holding
            up better than anticipated. They circled the perimeter like dogs
            fighting a trapped tiger, continually seeking the Grelbeast’s weak
            points. Unable to move from its spot, the demon could only seethe in
            frustration.
          </p>
          <p>It seemed Stefan’s judgment wasn’t entirely wrong after all.</p>
          <p>Stefan’s voice rose, boosting the morale of his troops.</p>
          <p>
            “Do not lose your spirit! We are the knights of Altion! Even this
            demon is terrified of our bravery!”
          </p>
          <p>The Grelbeast’s roar followed suit.</p>
          <p>“Kraaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            While it’s unclear why a demon would unleash such a ferocious roar
            if it were truly frightened, the knights were bravely confronting
            the Grelbeast nonetheless.
          </p>
          <p>
            These knights, carefully selected from the Altion Marquis Family,
            possessed the skill to at least block the first blow, no matter how
            formidable the opponent. Normally, blocking the initial attack would
            merely disrupt their stance, making them easy targets for a
            follow-up. However, now, as long as they could roll away and escape
            the demon’s attack range, survival was possible. Freed from the
            immediate fear of death, this battle felt easier than facing the
            Tagrel.
          </p>
          <p>This left Repenhardt feeling uneasy.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Ugh, I was hoping that young brat would just get knocked out so we
            could drag him out of here.’
          </p>
          <p>
            From their conversations alone, it was easy to tell what kind of
            person Stefan was. No amount of explanation would make him listen.
            Repenhardt had planned to persuade Sir Edward to leave the place as
            soon as the young noble fell. Sir Edward seemed to have a more
            realistic sense of danger and might have listened to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Surprisingly, Stefan showed commendable skill in holding his own
            against the Grelbeast.
          </p>
          <p>
            He moved adeptly, dodging incoming attacks and finding opportunities
            to strike. Positively described, he fluttered like a butterfly and
            stung like a bee. Negatively, he was merely pecking annoyingly. But
            it was clear he was managing to survive.
          </p>
          <p>“Agh!”</p>
          <p>
            With a sharp cry, Stefan lunged at the Grelbeast’s left side,
            slicing through its thigh. A faint wound opened, bleeding. Relsia
            then soared to the demon’s right, targeting its head. While the
            Grelbeast raised an arm to block, Stefan quickly slashed at its
            side.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cut seemed deep, dark blood spurted out, and the Grelbeast
            screamed.
          </p>
          <p>“Kraaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Quickly creating distance and escaping beyond reach, Stefan praised
            his companion.
          </p>
          <p>“Well done, Relsia!”</p>
          <p>“Thank you, master!”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt suddenly clicked his tongue in wonder.</p>
          <p>‘That Relsia, she’s quite skilled, isn’t she?’</p>
          <p>
            Aside from Stefan, she clearly seemed like the second most skilled
            of this group. Perhaps even more capable than Sir Edward. Moreover,
            their coordination was impeccable. They had obviously fought
            alongside each other frequently.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, if she’s that young brat’s Slayer, it makes sense.’</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 22 ]</p>
          <p>
            From a distance, Todd and Sillan were also dealing with the
            Grelbeast with a newfound coldness.
          </p>
          <p>
            “O Philanence, bestow upon this accursed being your sacred mace!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind Sillan, a pink hammer formed and struck the Grelbeast.
            Naturally, the goat-headed demon shattered the hammer of holy light
            with flames covering its body. It was something the Tagrel could do,
            so it was no surprise the Grelbeast could as well.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan grimaced and summoned his divine power once more.</p>
          <p>
            “O Philanence! Grant me the strength to heavily smite this accursed
            being with your holy mace!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, a bizarre prayer flowed, and dozens of light forms,
            including hammers and maces of various types, rose around Sillan. It
            looked like enough to set up a blacksmith shop.
          </p>
          <p>Thud, thud, thud!</p>
          <p>
            Dozens of maces left trails of pink light as they repeatedly struck
            the demon all over its body. Since there were more than one or two,
            the Grelbeast couldn’t block them all. Bound by chains, the demon
            couldn’t avoid the attacks and took them all directly.
          </p>
          <p>“Arrrgh!”</p>
          <p>
            Whether from pain or anger, the Grelbeast’s body trembled violently.
            But Sillan, undaunted, continued his holy assaults. Since the
            opponent couldn’t move, it was safe to unleash divine spells without
            worry.
          </p>
          <p>Todd was not idle either.</p>
          <p>
            “Laqua di Altun Baras, breath of the north wind, swirl in my hand!
            Blizzard Storm!”
          </p>
          <p>
            He continuously cast ice magic to protect the knights from the
            Grelbeast’s flames. Typically, mages attack while clerics defend,
            but this demon’s resistance to magic meant ordinary spells didn’t
            work on it. However, divine spells, while weakened, still affected
            it, leading to a reversal of their roles.
          </p>
          <p>Todd, an experienced mage, didn’t focus solely on defense.</p>
          <p>
            “Sephiro di Crotel, earth, stretch forth your hand to reclaim what
            originated from you! Iron Steel!”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the same spell that had disarmed the Beiter. The Grelbeast
            flinched, but the demon wasn’t weak enough for the increased weight
            to be unbearable. Once again, it swung its sword, spewing black mist
            in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>“Arrgh!”</p>
          <p>“Damn, it failed again?”</p>
          <p>
            Even as he expressed disappointment, Todd calmly prepared another
            disarmament spell.
          </p>
          <p>“If I keep looking for an opening, it’ll eventually work.”</p>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal was the Grelbeast’s magic sword, Altion. If they
            could just retrieve that, there would be no need to continue the
            confrontation. Todd’s judgment was indeed cold and pragmatic. Now
            that safety was assured, Todd truly demonstrated the demeanor of a
            mage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the surprising overall good atmosphere, everyone was
            diligently beating on the bound demon. It felt like witnessing a
            local custom of the Eastern Continent known as “rolling up in a
            straw mat.” It seemed that, if they continued like this, they might
            not defeat the demon but could at least retrieve the demonic sword.
          </p>
          <p>“Have I underestimated them?”</p>
          <p>
            Just as Repenhardt was about to relax, the chains binding the
            Grelbeast began to emit light. Simultaneously, the entire chamber
            trembled.
          </p>
          <p>“Uh?”</p>
          <p>“What’s that?”</p>

          <p>
            As everyone was bewildered, the chains of light that had bound the
            Grelbeast detached from the walls and wrapped around the demon’s
            limbs. An ominous light enveloped the Grelbeast’s entire body. A
            voice, difficult to understand, echoed from above the chamber.
          </p>
          <p>-Hepin Raltar Philoda. Ren Tu Baid Phase Talon.</p>
          <p>
            While the others were puzzled, Repenhardt immediately understood.
            The language was Destin, an ancient language from the Silver Age,
            and its meaning was…
          </p>
          <p>
            “The current defense system is overwhelmed. Transitioning to Phase
            2.”
          </p>
          <p>His expression turned desperate.</p>
          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>The Grelbeast raised its arms high,</p>
          <p>And burst into maniacal laughter.</p>
          <p>“Kahaha!”</p>
          <p>
            Chains of light still bound its limbs, but they were no longer
            connected to the walls. Although not completely freed, at this
            moment, the demon had gained some freedom of movement. Moreover, all
            the wounds that had been so diligently inflicted on the Grelbeast
            had disappeared. The transition to Phase 2 of the ruins had
            completely healed its injuries.
          </p>
          <p>“Kraltar!”</p>
          <p>
            With a chilling voice, the Grelbeast flung its arms to the side. The
            bound magical power flowed freely in all directions. It was no
            longer restrained!
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone froze in place. Even the bravest knights, and the cold Todd
            and Sillan, turned into statues at that moment.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>
            Sir Edward stared at the transforming demon with horror. His mind
            felt empty. The demon was free. There were no chains left to
            restrain this fearsome monster!
          </p>
          <p>Only one thought emerged.</p>
          <p>They had to run.</p>
          <p>They must escape!</p>
          <p>“Your Highness!”</p>
          <p>
            Just as Sir Edward was about to shout to Stefan, he felt his heart
            sink. His precious lord was now charging towards the dreadful demon.
          </p>
          <p>“Die, demon!”</p>
          <p>
            With a desperate cry, Stefan launched himself towards the Grelbeast,
            who mockingly swung its flame-imbued staff down. Stefan agilely
            dodged the attack, his focus as sharp as a finely honed blade.
          </p>
          <p>‘I can dodge attacks like this!’</p>
          <p>
            But the Grelbeast was no longer restrained. Following Stefan’s
            evasion, the demon swiftly kicked out at him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The kick, filled with the demon’s full force, was surprisingly
            well-executed for a demon, striking Stefan in midair with a powerful
            mid-kick.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>“No!”</p>
          <p>
            Sir Edward screamed in despair as he saw his lord spewing blood and
            flying through the air. Stefan landed with a wretched cry, all
            notions of knightly pride shattered by the excruciating pain of his
            bones crushing.
          </p>

          <p>“Aaahhhhhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Yet, the fact that Stefan could still scream suggested he hadn’t
            been killed instantly. Edward rushed to support him, his young lord
            enduring the agony without losing consciousness.
          </p>
          <p>“Uh, Sir Edward…”</p>
          <p>“Thank goodness, Your Highness!”</p>
          <p>
            Passing a teary-eyed Sir Edward, the loyal slave, Relsia, charged
            recklessly at the Grelbeast but was soon struck down by the demon’s
            tail. Her slender body twisted grotesquely as she coughed up blood.
          </p>
          <p>“Kreeeeeeee!”</p>
          <p>
            That wasn’t the end. Before Relsia even hit the ground, the
            Grelbeast opened its mouth, releasing a foul sulfurous breath and
            spitting sinister flames towards Todd and Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The event unfolded too quickly for Sillan to react. His eyes widened
            momentarily as hellfire flickered across his golden irises.
          </p>
          <p>“Clash!”</p>
          <p>
            A burst of golden light intercepted the flames. Repenhardt, now
            enveloped in an aura, had stepped in front of him, splitting the
            flames that soon dissipated. Sillan exclaimed with joy.
          </p>
          <p>“Repen!”</p>
          <p>“Sorry, I was a bit startled myself and reacted late.”</p>
          <p>
            Apologizing with a rueful voice, Repenhardt deflected the demon’s
            flames with a Spiral Guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flames subsided. The Grelbeast, recognizing a worthy opponent,
            focused its attention on Repenhardt, sensing that this formidable
            figure was unlike any he had faced so far.
          </p>
          <p>‘Hmm…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked up at the Grelbeast with a serious expression. He
            couldn’t help but wonder about his own strength. Could the martial
            prowess contained within him be enough to handle this demon?
          </p>
          <p>
            The wizard, wary of unwinnable gambles, nevertheless felt the thrill
            of confronting a formidable opponent. It was an unfamiliar
            sensation, unlike anything he’d experienced in his past life.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Damn, I’ve really become a warrior. My master would be pleased.’
          </p>
          <p>
            A brief lull followed as each tried to read the other’s movements,
            shifting slightly to the left and right. Then, suddenly, Repenhardt
            launched himself forward.
          </p>
          <p>
            “When in doubt, the first strike is the best course of action,” he
            remembered his master’s teaching and approached the Grelbeast. In
            the frail academies they taught to wait and counterattack, but for
            someone who could take a hit like Gym Unbreakable, a preemptive
            strike was always the best approach.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt charged, the demon opened its mouth, and a blaze from
            hell poured forth. With his arms, he cleaved through the flames,
            swiftly moved to his opponent’s side, and delivered a low kick
            loaded with a restraint, striking the demon’s thigh with a golden
            aura.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh?”</p>
          <p>
            The Grelbeast’s expression changed. The light blow had an impact far
            from ordinary. How could this small human possess such power?
          </p>
          <p>
            Seizing the moment of the Grelbeast’s stagger, Repenhardt kicked off
            the ground.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaat!”</p>
          <p>
            He flew, landing a kick directly into the demon’s solar plexus
            followed by a knee to the jaw, tilting the Grelbeast’s head back
            with a powerful jumping knee strike.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            The Grelbeast, groaning, swung its sword in desperation. The dark
            magic sword Altion emitted a black aura as it flew. The black blade
            brushed past Repenhardt’s chest as he recoiled from the attack.
          </p>

          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt felt as if claws had scraped across his chest and
            grimaced. He stepped back, looking down at his chest, which was
            slightly swollen as if scratched by nails.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? I got scratched?”</p>
          <p>
            It seemed that not even a steel sword could deflect a magic sword
            imbued with a demon’s magic. While an ordinary person might marvel
            at surviving such an encounter, Repenhardt, accustomed to the
            resilience of Gym Unbreakable, was more shocked by the scratch on
            his ‘tough body.’
          </p>
          <p>“You bastard!”</p>
          <p>
            Enraged, Repenhardt threw a punch and his golden aura blasted like a
            cannon, hitting the Grelbeast squarely in the chest. The demon
            staggered, losing balance from the energy strike. Seizing the
            opportunity, Repenhardt charged again.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaat!”</p>
          <p>
            Suspended in midair, Repenhardt delivered a series of kicks imbued
            with aura. The Grelbeast, defending itself with its arms raised, was
            repeatedly pushed back. Unable to use its arms for defense and
            needing to maintain its balance, it couldn’t lift its legs off the
            ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The best defense is a good offense,” it is said. With his
            relentless kicks, Repenhardt even managed to block the Grelbeast’s
            attacks.
          </p>
          <p>However, he had forgotten that this demon possessed a tail.</p>
          <p>“Karata!”</p>
          <p>
            With a monstrous howl, a crimson tail whipped like a lash, striking
            Repenhardt’s flank hard.
          </p>
          <p>Thud!</p>
          <p>
            With the sound of impact, he was hurled like an arrow shot into a
            wall, embedding himself into it. His body, as durable as steel,
            smashed through the stone wall, causing the entire chamber to quake
            and dust to rise everywhere.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan exclaimed in surprise.</p>
          <p>“Mr. Repen!”</p>
          <p>
            The force to send a man flying and embed him into a wall was
            astonishing! Sillan looked towards the dust-rising stone wall with
            eyes full of worry. Then, he gasped in shock.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, I’m fine.”</p>
          <p>
            Wrapped in a golden aura, Repenhardt casually walked out. It was so
            incredible that Sillan couldn’t help but exclaim in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“Good heavens…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan was astounded. A human made of flesh and blood had smashed
            through a wall and emerged unscathed? Not just any wall, but one
            from the Silver Age ruins, which had withstood thousands of years of
            weathering and could barely be scratched even with a heavy hammer!
          </p>
          <p>‘Is this the power of an aura wielder?’</p>
          <p>Repenhardt, touching his neck, hardened his expression.</p>
          <p>‘I’ve made a mistake.’</p>
          <p>
            Despite being hurled so dramatically, he was almost unharmed. Six
            years of training had not been in vain. The reason Repenhardt was
            thrown so easily was because Gerard was the only opponent he had
            ever fought.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Always getting hit by the master’s attacks has made me
            subconsciously dodge them.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Using his body to fly back and reduce the impact was a fine
            defensive technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the opponent’s attacks were on Gerard’s level, then it was right
            to defend in that manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, sometimes it’s necessary to withstand an attack. If he had
            just withstood that attack, he might have found an opportunity to
            counter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just because he could spar with the strongest didn’t make him the
            strongest. Experience truly cannot be underestimated. Repenhardt,
            with a newfound realization, carefully circled the Grelbeast.
          </p>
          <p>He thought it was a perfect opportunity.</p>
          <p>‘It’s time to calmly sort out the techniques I’ve learned.’</p>
          <p>
            The opponent was suitable, and it even felt like an opportunity
            granted by the heavens. Repenhardt clenched his fists, burning with
            fighting spirit.

            <p>[ Chapter 23 ]</p>
            <p>
              Steel-like fighting spirit flared like rough flames encased in
              golden aura, while the Grelbeast’s entire body exploded with
              demonic energy. The demon roared out a challenge.
            </p>
            <p>“Kara!”</p>
            <p>“I don’t know what that means, but let’s just fight!”</p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt charged forward as he shouted back, with the Grelbeast
              bulging his muscles in response, charging as well. Like two robust
              bulls clashing in a test of strength, a human and a demon began
              exchanging frenzied blows.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stefan watched the scene before him with a dazed expression,
              overwhelmed by pain so intense he felt he might lose consciousness
              at any moment, yet he couldn’t faint.
            </p>
            <p>“Ah…”</p>
            <p>
              A lowly savage was battling a demon. He was effortlessly blocking
              the demon’s fearsome attacks that had easily defeated him, diving
              in with amazing agility to deliver cunning strikes continuously.
              Each hit was lethal, making the demon scream with every impact.
            </p>
            <p>
              That nobody was shining with a golden light, incomparably better
              than his own noble lineage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Wrapped in a dazzling, beautiful brilliance, the coveted light of
              destruction every swordsman and martial artist desires.
            </p>
            <p>“An aura…”</p>
            <p>His face was a mix of emptiness and shock.</p>
            <p>
              An unknown commoner, of low birth and no renown, was fighting a
              demon using the power of an aura, something even he, a noble of
              nobles, had not yet manifested.
            </p>
            <p>“What is this…”</p>
            <p>It felt like the world was crumbling around him.</p>
            <p>“It can’t be…”</p>
            <p>Everything he had believed in seemed like a lie.</p>
            <p>
              Everyone had said he would be the next great knight commander for
              the kingdom. That he could be the fourth aura user in the Vasily
              Kingdom. Everyone had said it, and Stefan had believed it too.
            </p>
            <p>He was to be the powerful successor of a great lineage.</p>
            <p>
              Yet here was a monster, of similar age, easily wielding an aura
              with astonishing might. The power was tremendous; it seemed he
              would not be outmatched even by Sir Talion, the captain of the
              royal knights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confusion reigned. His mind was in turmoil, wanting to scream in
              madness.
            </p>
            <p>What exactly was this creature?</p>
            <p>Where did such a being come from?</p>
            <p>
              Exactly what was this monster, displaying such incredible skill at
              his age?
            </p>
            <p>
              Amidst shock and despair, he was unable to even feel anger, simply
              staring blankly at Repenhardt’s back.
            </p>

            <p>
              As the battle raged on, Repenhardt could keenly feel how
              extraordinary the techniques he had learned truly were.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demon’s attack was fierce, but it could not harm his body.
              This body, awakened with aura on a flesh of steel, was truly
              formidable. Only attacks utilizing the magic sword Altion could
              inflict even a scratch; everything else could be handled with his
              bare body without concern.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, Repenhardt diligently avoided the Grelbeast’s attacks
              while counterattacking. It was, after all, an excellent
              opportunity for practical training, making it necessary to become
              accustomed to the combat style of a martial artist.
            </p>
            <p>
              Dodging a downward strike from Altion, he grabbed and twisted the
              forearm. Joint lock practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Diving deep into the chest, striking the solar plexus, neck, and
              chin simultaneously. Striking practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Avoiding a tail whipping like a whip, he leapt, spinning for a
              kick. Aerial combat practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              Each time, the Grelbeast was battered, flesh burst open, and blood
              was splattered. Yet, as a guardian connected to the ruins, this
              demon, despite suffering severe injuries, never fell. The ruins
              provided magical energy, continuously healing the demon’s wounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              At first, he thought it was convenient to have a self-repairing
              sandbag…
            </p>
            <p>“This, this is…”</p>
            <p>
              After a prolonged fight, Repenhardt began to feel tired. Yet, the
              Grelbeast was still vigorously attacking him. The ancient power
              was indeed formidable, bestowing continuous strength to the demon
              despite such punishment.
            </p>
            <p>“It’s not the time to be playing around.”</p>
            <p>
              Feeling a sense of urgency, he rapidly thought through his
              options.
            </p>
            <p>The solution in such situations was simple.</p>
            <p>
              Attack not the guardian, but the magical energy itself, dispersing
              its flow for a moment. Then, quickly defeat the guardian while
              it’s vulnerable.
            </p>
            <p>“But expecting that at his level is unrealistic…”</p>
            <p>
              Todd wasn’t unaware of this tactic; it was a matter of lacking the
              ability.
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, a powerful attack that doesn’t leave room for
              healing, destroying the guardian in one blow, could work. If the
              body itself is destroyed, what use is the overflowing magical
              power from the ruins? Of course, it’s no easy task, but Repenhardt
              possessed a technique powerful enough for that.
            </p>
            <p>“Should I use Calamity Soul?”</p>
            <p>
              The ultimate secret technique of Gym Unbreakable, a
              quadruple-layered force capable of piercing cliffs and overturning
              lakes with its tremendous power; he was confident that he could
              obliterate the Grelbeast with it.
            </p>
            <p>However, that would pose a serious problem.</p>
            <p>
              “Ugh, doing that would bring everything down here, burying us all
              together in a mass grave.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Given the power he wielded, unleashing it recklessly underground
              would undoubtedly cause the chamber to collapse. It would be
              spectacularly buried. And the only one who could crawl out of the
              dirt heap would be Repenhardt alone.
            </p>
            <p>“Having so many burdens is indeed troublesome.”</p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt continued the battle. The fight dragged on as neither
              could deliver a fatal blow. Both sides possessed defense
              overwhelmingly superior to their offense. Normally, the stronger
              the fighter, the higher their offensive power compared to their
              defensive ability. However, the Grelbeast, directly connected to
              the relic’s magic, and Repenhardt, who foolishly relied on his
              physical strength, were breaking the common perceptions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should they keep fighting to the point of exhaustion to see who
              tires first? Honestly, it wasn’t impossible , but…
            </p>
            <p>“That would be fine for me, but the others might die.”</p>

            <p>
              There were already many injured. Sillan was frantically casting
              healing spells, but the dense magical energy reduced their
              effectiveness. Healing spells, being highly complex divine
              incantations, were significantly affected by the environment. To
              properly heal them, they had to leave this room.
            </p>
            <p>
              As Repenhardt was feeling troubled, Todd’s shout came from behind.
            </p>
            <p>“Hey, Repen!”</p>
            <p>“Huh?”</p>
            <p>
              Looking back in confusion, Repenhardt saw the mage Todd pointing
              at a sword on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Pick up the sword! If Sillan casts a striking divine spell on the
              sword enveloped in aura, it will have enough power to defeat that
              demon!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Todd, true to his nature as a relic explorer, had grasped the
              situation. Indeed, when magic was insufficient, aura users
              defeating dungeon guardians with that method was the standard.
            </p>
            <p>
              Divine power repels magic energy, disrupting its flow when
              properly attacked. However, without sufficient sharpness, mixing
              it with aura was necessary to achieve a magical effect. Todd was
              advising to use this approach.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Ah, do you think I don’t use it because I don’t know about it?”
            </p>
            <p>Repenhardt retorted irritably.</p>
            <p>“Look, I don’t know how to envelop weapons in aura.”</p>
            <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
            <p>“I can only channel aura through my body!”</p>
            <p>“That doesn’t make any sense…”</p>
            <p>
              Todd trailed off in confusion. Wasn’t the quintessential image of
              an aura user a gleaming blade? That was supposed to be the
              hallmark of an aura user, something anyone with aura could do.
            </p>
            <p>“Ah, it’s just that our martial sect is a bit unusual!”</p>
            <p>
              Facing the enemy caused Repenhardt’s concentration to scatter. He
              gave a brief response and refocused on the battle with the demon.
            </p>
            <p>
              At that moment, Sillan, who was casting a healing spell on Stefan,
              shouted towards him.
            </p>
            <p>“Mr. Repen!”</p>
            <p>“What now?”</p>
            <p>“Your body, it’s highly durable, right?”</p>
            <p>“Huh?”</p>
            <p>
              It was a strange question to use expressions typically meant for
              rocks on a human body, but Repenhardt understood. Having seen him
              break through walls with his bare body, it made sense.
            </p>
            <p>“It’s somewhat tougher than most. Why?”</p>
            <p>“I believe you!”</p>

            <p>“Believe what?”</p>
            <p>
              As Repenhardt looked puzzled, Sillan suddenly offered a prayer.
            </p>
            <p>
              “O Philanence, let your blessing inhabit this sword meant for your
              goddess!”
            </p>
            <p>“Sword?”</p>
            <p>
              Then, a dazzling pinkish divine light enveloped Repenhardt’s
              entire body. He choked as if something was caught in his throat.
            </p>
            <p>“Co-, Cough?!”</p>
            <p>“It worked!”</p>
            <p>
              Sillan had directly applied the striking divine spell, Holy
              Striking, on Repenhardt’s body. Normally, the spell should be cast
              on a metal object, so casting it directly on a person’s body
              should not have worked…
            </p>
            <p>“What in the world…”</p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt looked down at himself, bewildered. The divine spell
              had taken effect. His steel-like body was recognized as a lump of
              metal.
            </p>
            <p>“…”</p>
            <p>
              He was at a loss for words. His originally bronze skin was now
              prettily tinted pink, shimmering brightly. It was a sight so
              demoralizing that it could instantly sap one’s fighting spirit.
            </p>
            <p>“Ah, is this really okay?”</p>
            <p>
              Even the Grelbeast seemed taken aback, pausing its attack to stare
              blankly. What else could one do at the sight of Repenhardt? – a
              190 cm tall pink giant.
            </p>
            <p>“Ha, ha…”</p>
            <p>
              Feeling deflated, Repenhardt couldn’t help but think that living
              long enough meant experiencing all sorts of bizarre situations.
              Regardless of how Repenhardt felt, Sillan, having successfully
              cast the spell, was overjoyed.
            </p>
            <p>“Great! It worked! I knew it would!”</p>
            <p>He exclaimed triumphantly.</p>
            <p>“Take that, you damned demon! Beat it to death now!”</p>
            <p>“He looks pretty but has a nasty temper…”</p>
            <p>
              Now that they had a strategy, the fight had to continue. With a
              gloomy expression, Repenhardt charged at the Grelbeast.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pink giant rushed towards the demon. Every punch and kick left
              behind sparkling pink divine light particles.
            </p>
            <p>“…”</p>
            <p>
              He felt even more depressed. The martial artist who had been
              engaging in a cool struggle just moments before seemed to have
              vanished, replaced by a circus clown.
            </p>
            <p>‘Ah, damn it. Let’s finish this quickly.’</p>
            <p>
              Transformed into a holy vessel, Repenhardt relentlessly attacked.
              Holy punches, holy kicks, and holy knee strikes followed one
              another, mercilessly hitting the demon. Regardless of appearances,
              the divine power was still divine power. The effect was undeniably
              positive. The demon, unable to receive any more magical energy,
              quickly began to falter.
            </p>
            <p>
              A final downward strike to the back of the nearly dead demon’s
              head! Sprinkling pink sparkles, the demon let out its last cry.
            </p>
            <p>“Aaaagh!”</p>
            <p>
              And thus, the Grelbeast, having lost the power to dwell in the
              material world, slowly began to fade away. Although it was slain,
              this release from the relic was, in a way, salvation for the
              demon.
            </p>
            <p>
              Watching the demon disappear, Repenhardt sighed in relief. He
              quickly turned to Sillan and shouted.
            </p>
            <p>“Hey! Quick, undo this!”</p>

            <p>[ Chapter 24 ]</p>
            <p>
              With the disappearance of the Grelbeast, the magical energy pooled
              within the chamber also vanished. Sillan cast healing spells on
              all the injured in unison. Both the unconscious Relsia and Stefan,
              whose bones were shattered, recovered to a point where they could
              somewhat move.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was a power beyond the reach of any ordinary priest. Sillan’s
              divine power, honed solely through his dedication to muscle, was
              indeed formidable. Of course, the outcome was somewhat tragic for
              him.
            </p>
            <p>
              Meanwhile, Repenhardt had been impatiently stomping his feet,
              wondering when the annoying pink sacred light would disappear.
              Just as the divine power finally dissipated and he began to relax,
              Stefan limped over to him.
            </p>
            <p>“Did you say your name was Repen?”</p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt turned around, thinking Stefan might be about to
              express his gratitude. Instead, Stefan scowled and continued.
            </p>
            <p>
              “…… You hid your identity well. Did you think we were that
              foolish?”
            </p>
            <p>
              What is he talking about? Repenhardt, bewildered, found himself at
              a loss for words as Stefan spoke again.
            </p>
            <p>
              “I’ll admit you are strong. But I cannot forgive you for trampling
              on the honor of a knight!”
            </p>
            <p>
              What honor has been trampled? Repenhardt was even more confused
              and couldn’t find the words to reply. Seeing Repenhardt’s silence,
              Stefan raised his voice in anger.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Did you find it amusing to watch us flounder and laugh at us?”
            </p>
            <p>Laugh at them?</p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt looked at Stefan with a blank face. He swore sincerely
              that he never mocked them. Mockery is an emotion that only comes
              with interest, and how could he mock something he had no interest
              in to begin with?
            </p>
            <p>
              ‘Well, when you think about it, it’s even worse than mockery.’
            </p>
            <p>Scratching his head, he simply turned his back.</p>
            <p>“You bastard!”</p>
            <p>
              Stefan lunged with his sword. Repenhardt casually turned his body.
              He had even avoided the ruthlessly merciless punches of Gerard. It
              was a well-posed strike, but avoiding it was no trouble at all.
            </p>
            <p>“Ugh!”</p>
            <p>
              Stefan, having swung his sword into thin air, lost his balance and
              staggered before falling. The sudden swing tangled his feet. It
              was a disgrace that would normally be unthinkable, but Stefan, out
              of his mind, lost his balance and fell, rolling on the ground.
            </p>
            <p>‘Look at that?’</p>
            <p>
              Seeing him self-slice and roll on the ground on his own brought no
              anger. Repenhardt smirked and walked over, picking up the sword
              that had fallen a distance away.
            </p>
            <p>
              The magic sword Altion. It was left behind when the Grelbeast
              disappeared.
            </p>
            <p>‘This bastard dared to dodge!’</p>
            <p>
              With his face turning red, Stefan rose again. Just as he was about
              to rush in, Repenhardt suddenly blocked his path. The movement was
              so fast that it was impossible to see how it had been done. The
              hand holding the sword stiffened as if it had gone numb. Feeling
              the gap in their skills, Stefan couldn’t muster the courage to
              attack again.
            </p>

            <p>“Hey.”</p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt placed his hand on Stefan’s shoulder and spoke in a
              soft voice.
            </p>
            <p>“I wasn’t laughing at you, you know?”</p>
            <p>
              To be honest, I couldn’t care less. So why do you keep picking a
              fight, huh?
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, he pressed down hard on the shoulder. A tremendous force was
              transmitted through the shoulder, causing Stefan to groan and
              stagger.
            </p>
            <p>“Argh!”</p>
            <p>
              “So, take this with you. Wasn’t this what all the fuss was about?”
            </p>
            <p>“Ah, Altion…”</p>
            <p>
              Stefan’s expression twisted in utter humiliation. He wanted
              nothing more than to throw away the sword and claim he didn’t need
              it. That would have been his last shred of dignity.
            </p>
            <p>But he couldn’t. Stefan took Altion with trembling hands.</p>
            <p>“Damn it!”</p>
            <p>
              Having obtained what he so desired, all that was left was a sense
              of despair.
            </p>
            <p>
              On the other hand, Sir Edward’s perception of Repenhardt had
              completely changed. The arrogant attitude he had shown all this
              time suddenly made sense. As an aura user, he could become a high
              noble anywhere, so it was natural for him to behave in such a way.
              He felt a bit resentful at how Repenhardt treated Stefan, but
              honestly, he had no intention of confronting such a strong person.
            </p>
            <p>“You know chivalry even without holding a sword.”</p>
            <p>
              How could he not covet such a fine sword at all! Truly an amazing
              young man.
            </p>
            <p>
              “To stand in front of a treasure and yet keep free from desire,
              you are indeed a true strong man!”
            </p>
            <p>
              Sir Edward kept marveling, causing Repenhardt to scratch his cheek
              awkwardly.
            </p>
            <p>‘No, it’s not really like that.’</p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt, who had just knocked Stefan unconscious and scraped
              every penny off him, what free of desire?
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason he had no interest in Altion was simple. He just didn’t
              covet it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The enchanted sword, Altion, was indeed an outstanding magic
              sword. So much so that…
            </p>
            <p>
              ‘It’s about as good as the 2nd-grade magic weapons I used to make
              back in my heyday.’
            </p>
            <p>
              Yes, in his previous life, he was the greatest archmage, reaching
              the pinnacle of all magic. Naturally, his enchantment skills were
              also at a high level.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon establishing the Antares Empire, there was a time when great
              effort was put into crafting magical weapons, desiring to provide
              valuable subordinates with superior arms. The Four Heavenly Kings
              each had their unique weapons and were not particularly attached
              to magical ones, but it was different for the ordinary non-human
              subordinates. A significant number were produced and distributed
              to those who had contributed to their efforts. Though
              mass-produced, and thus slightly inferior in performance, these
              were still of notable quality.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the standards of Repenhardt, the performance was considered
              lesser, yet to others, these magical artifacts appeared incredibly
              formidable. Non-human warriors wielding swords created by a 10th
              Circle Archmage were powerful enough to instill fear across the
              continent.
            </p>

            <p>
              This particular artifact, Altion, was merely on the level of one
              of those mass-produced items. There was no need for greed; magical
              items of this sort could be easily produced once magic was
              regained.
            </p>
            <p>Selling it could indeed amass a fortune…</p>
            <p>
              ‘It’s just a hassle to covet such things, it’s better to just give
              it away than to have a lifelong feud with the Marquis family.’
            </p>
            <p>
              After all, better magical swords awaited him in other ruins. It
              was unwise to miss out on greater gains for immediate, lesser
              benefits.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Anyway, let’s head back. We’ve got no more business here,”
              Repenhardt awkwardly changed the subject.
            </p>
            <p>“Let’s. Haha.”</p>
            <p>
              Sir Edward laughed heartily, still looking at him with admiration.
            </p>
            <p>
              Once they returned to the first floor, the situation became
              easier. Stefan and his group collected the relics of the fallen
              knights, and Repenhardt once again donned his cherished coat. They
              carefully made their way through the passage, finally leaving
              Falton behind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon returning to Cattle Village, everyone prepared for their
              departure. During their time there, Sillan generously distributed
              some gold coins he had acquired from the ruins to the villagers.
              For the people of Cattle, who were facing a harsh winter, this act
              was akin to a divine messenger’s arrival. Both Philanence and
              Sillan’s names were praised by all.
            </p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt smiled warmly at Sillan, who was busily casting healing
              spells on some of the village’s sick.
            </p>
            <p>‘The guy’s good at business.’</p>
            <p>
              Distributing gold coins in such a small mountain village might
              seem like a waste of money at first glance. However, considering
              the positive image it brought to the Philanence Order, the
              expenditure was trivial.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rumors spread far and wide. News of their kindness in a small
              village could serve as excellent advertising. After all, in the
              big cities, they collected significant donations for their healing
              services, so the financial loss was negligible.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, observing Sillan’s actions, it didn’t seem like he
              thought too deeply about things; it appeared he was genuinely
              helping the villagers out of sympathy.
            </p>
            <p>
              ‘His gaze might be peculiar, but he’s a decent fellow, indeed.’
            </p>
            <p>
              Upon arriving in the village, Repenhardt immediately severed ties
              with the Altion Knights. Sir Edward invited him to the capital,
              expressing a desire to show his gratitude, but Repenhardt politely
              declined. He needed to meet Siris as soon as possible. And even if
              that weren’t the reason…
            </p>
            <p>
              ‘Honestly, that young brat keeps grinding his teeth. Do you think
              he’d go to reward me? It would be a miracle if I don’t end up
              getting stabbed in the night.’
            </p>
            <p>Well, not that a stabbing would penetrate him, anyway.</p>
            <p>
              Nonetheless, the exploration of the Falton ruins ended on an
              overwhelmingly positive note.
            </p>
            <p>
              The House of Altion was happy to have retrieved their magic sword;
              Todd was thrilled not only to have acquired an ancient relic but
              also to have met the beautiful young man, Sillan, and Sillan was
              overjoyed to have met the big, handsome (in a manner of speaking)
              muscular man of his dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt, having achieved his goal of making a hefty sum of
              money, was naturally happy as well.
            </p>
            <p>Everyone was happy. Everyone, that is, except for Stefan.</p>
            <p>“Sir Edward.”</p>
            <p>“What is it, my lord?”</p>
            <p>
              Sir Edward approached Stefan, reins in hand, as they rode along a
              narrow mountain path in the Hattan Range. Everyone’s spirits were
              high. Although they had lost three precious companions, they had
              successfully recovered the magic sword Altion, as decreed by their
              family. This achievement would surely make their names echo
              through the capital!
            </p>

            <p>
              Caught up in the excitement, Sir Edward didn’t notice that his
              lord maintained a stern expression.
            </p>
            <p>“Look into that young man named Repen, would you?”</p>
            <p>
              “Ah, taking an interest in a strong peer is good. I will do what I
              can once we return to the family.”
            </p>
            <p>
              It seems seeing a strong warrior has stimulated him, as befits a
              warrior! Sir Edward thought simplistically, missing the cold
              expression that Stefan wore as he turned his head away.
            </p>
            <p>
              He couldn’t accept it. The fact that a young man, who appeared to
              be around his age, had already awakened his aura.
            </p>
            <p>“There’s no way I’m inferior to someone like him.”</p>
            <p>
              ‘I do not know what methods were employed. However, if that lowly
              bloodline could achieve it, then surely I can as well. And if it
              proves impossible…’
            </p>
            <p>“No, it can’t be impossible.”</p>
            <p>
              Stefan vehemently shook his head. The world he knew was one where
              such events simply could not occur. It was a world where the
              existence of another young aura wielder besides himself was
              inconceivable.
            </p>
            <p>Such a world must not be acknowledged…</p>
            <p>Stefan’s expression grew increasingly ominous as he spoke.</p>
            <p>
              Walking along a mountain path, Repenhardt was all smiles. He
              seemed thrilled to bits, constantly fiddling with the backpack at
              his waist.
            </p>
            <p>‘Great! Now all that’s left is to meet Siris!’</p>
            <p>
              Having secured a hefty sum of money, all that remained was to
              hurry to the Principality of Chatan and reunite with his beloved.
              He was understandably excited.
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, with a light step, Repenhardt was on his way. Soon, he
              sensed someone hurrying towards him from behind.
            </p>
            <p>“Huh?”</p>
            <p>Without even looking back, he guessed who it was.</p>
            <p>
              ‘Isn’t that Sillan? Why is he coming this way instead of following
              the others?’
            </p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt turned around, puzzled. After all, to claim the
              promised reward, one would need to follow the others. That’s why
              Todd was currently struggling to ride a horse that refused to be
              ridden, following them to the Altion Marquisate household, wasn’t
              he?
            </p>
            <p>
              Curiosity made him wait, and sure enough, before long, he saw a
              youth with red hair and golden eyes running towards him from the
              other end of the road. Sillan, having run hard, stopped in front
              of Repenhardt and gasped for breath.
            </p>
            <p>
              It became clear. It wasn’t just a coincidental shared path; Sillan
              had definitely followed him.
            </p>
            <p>“What is it?”</p>
            <p>
              Sillan, having caught his breath, smiled brightly and answered.
            </p>
            <p>
              “Do you know? Among the clergy, there are those who travel the
              world to spread the goddess’s grace and care for the faithful?”
            </p>
            <p>“I know, they’re pilgrims, right?”</p>
            <p>
              Repenhardt was well aware. It was a common endeavor among the
              youthful and energetic clergy.
            </p>
            <p>‘And in the process, quite a few of them end up dying.’</p>
            <p>
              “I had decided that after completing this task, I wouldn’t return
              to the order but would instead embark on the path of a pilgrim.”
            </p>
            <p>Sillan declared proudly, puffing out his chest.</p>
            <p>
              “So, I wanted to accompany you, the strongest person I’ve seen, if
              possible.”
            </p>

              <p>[ Chapter 25 ]</p>
              <p>
                Repenhardt gazed down at the rather pretty boy before him. He
                had always felt something off about the boy’s gaze. At a glance,
                it could be seen as the look of a teenager admiring a strong
                warrior, but it seemed to be something more than that.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was a feeling similar to that of Gerard or Todd; somehow, it
                seemed like this boy only cared about the body in a different
                sense.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Why do I feel like I’ve been cursed? Why are all these types
                around me?”
              </p>
              <p>Ah, how he longed to meet Siris. His beloved Siris.</p>
              <p>
                Regardless, there was absolutely no reason to let Sillan
                accompany him. Just as he was about to refuse, a thought
                suddenly crossed his mind.
              </p>
              <p>‘Wait, this boy is a priest, isn’t he?’</p>
              <p>A priest.</p>
              <p>
                An agent of God’s will, who cares for people with miracles,
                leads them according to God’s teachings, and guides them towards
                a righteous life.
              </p>
              <p>
                Well, that was a rough definition, but Repenhardt, who had been
                a magician, didn’t really believe in such teachings. To him, the
                word “priest” meant one thing only.
              </p>
              <p>A top-tier medicine bottle.</p>
              <p>
                A high-quality bandage that could heal wounds and illnesses with
                just a touch.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Come to think of it, having someone to take care of Siris in
                case she gets hurt or sick wouldn’t be bad, would it?”
              </p>
              <p>
                In the past, Repenhardt could heal with his magic, having
                mastered the healing arts. But now, that was impossible. Though,
                with the aura of Gym Unbreakable, he could achieve a similar
                effect using healing drugs, but that was too costly.
              </p>
              <p>“Having a walking medicine bottle has no downside, right?”</p>
              <p>
                He didn’t think much of it initially, but now that he realized
                how useful the boy could be, greed grew within him. Repenhardt
                smiled gently. His attitude changed abruptly, causing Sillan to
                look at him with a slight wariness. He shrugged his shoulders
                and gestured with his hand.
              </p>
              <p>“Do as you please. Follow me or not.”</p>
              <p>
                After giving his permission, Repenhardt started walking again.
                Delighted, Sillan clung to his side and began to chatter away.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I want to make my abs more defined, but it seems difficult with
                just sit-ups. Should I separately stress the upper, middle, and
                lower abs to properly form a six-pack?”
              </p>
              <p>
                “I don’t know. All I know is getting beaten to death and lifting
                rocks until death.”
              </p>
              <p>
                While casually brushing off the conversation, he took this
                muscle-obsessed, pretty boy priest on the road with him. Now, it
                was time to head to the Principality of Chatan.
              </p>

              <p>‘Siris, I’m on my way!’</p>
              <p>
                “Come to think of it, I heard a rumor that one of the alchemists
                concocted a potion specifically effective for muscle
                enhancement. They named it ‘Protein’, didn’t they?”
              </p>
              <p>“Ah, I told you I’m not interested.”</p>
              <p>
                As the two grumbled, the winter sunset was slowly descending
                above their heads.
              </p>
              <p>* * *</p>
              <p>
                In a grand mansion made of massive marble, three stories high
                with numerous annexes, a young man was screaming in one of the
                bedrooms.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Damn it! Her attitude is still the same! How exactly did you
                train her?”
              </p>
              <p>
                In front of the young man, a burly man knelt, stammering out
                excuses.
              </p>
              <p>“I’m sorry, Master Beret! I did my best, but…”</p>
              <p>
                The man gritted his teeth and turned to the side. In a corner of
                the bedroom, a beautiful elf girl with dusky skin stood with a
                cold expression. She was the ‘Slayer’ that Beret had purchased
                two weeks ago.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beret had already toyed with many elf slaves, but he had never
                managed to acquire a Slayer. Elf slaves, already eye-wateringly
                expensive compared to other slaves, commanded an astronomical
                price, and among them, Slayers were known to be incredibly
                expensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the Duchy of Chatan, Beret was the successor to Caron, one of
                the top ten trading guilds. Yet, even for him, purchasing a
                Slayer was not a decision to be made lightly.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this time, a Slayer appeared on the market at an
                unusually low price, equivalent to that of a common elf slave.
                Its suspiciously low cost prompted Beret to inquire about it,
                only to learn that the elf’s temperamental nature made her
                difficult to sell. Despite this, her combat abilities were
                undeniably fitting of a Slayer, and her beauty was sufficient
                for nocturnal attendance. Thus, Beret decided to take a chance
                and purchased her, thinking he could manage her finicky nature
                with proper training.
              </p>
              <p>
                Beret, who already owned many elf slaves, was not overly
                concerned. After all, how troublesome could a slave’s
                personality be? As long as she obeyed orders, that was enough
                for him.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, upon acquiring her, the reason for her low price became
                immediately clear. This elf girl was incredibly spirited.
              </p>
              <p>“Ah, those unlucky eyes…”</p>
              <p>
                Beret scowled at the unnamed Slayer girl who, wrapped in a thin
                blanket, stared back at him with cold eyes that somehow managed
                to be indifferent yet provocatively contemptuous.
              </p>
              <p>
                The elf girl did not outright refuse to follow orders. When
                instructed, she complied.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet, each time, she would blatantly send a chill down his spine
                with her frosty gaze. The audacity of an elf to carry herself as
                if she were human! She was expected to be loyal and affectionate
                towards her master, offering both her body and heart. Wasn’t
                that the very reason he had paid a hefty sum for her?
              </p>
              <p>
                Attempts at ‘training’ her were made. They starved her and beat
                her, measures that typically subdued even the most disobedient
                slaves.
              </p>
              <p>
                However, such methods were futile with this girl. Despite being
                beaten to a pulp and starved for three days straight, she
                maintained her haughty demeanor. While there was the option of
                taking time to gently win her over, Beret had no intention of
                doing so. Why bother with a slave if he was to court her as one
                would in a romantic pursuit?
              </p>
              <p>Frustrated, Beret exploded in anger.</p>

              <p>“Damn it, can’t you do something about those eyes?”</p>
              <p>With an indifferent tone, the elf girl responded,</p>
              <p>“They are the eyes I was born with.”</p>
              <p>
                Her manner was indifferent, but her tone was unmistakably
                sarcastic.
              </p>
              <p>“Why is this elf so insolent?”</p>
              <p>“It’s my natural disposition.”</p>
              <p>
                Despite Beret’s fiery anger, the slave girl retorted with every
                rebuke. Overwhelmed with rage, Beret struck the elf girl.
              </p>
              <p>Thwack!!</p>
              <p>
                The slender body of the girl tumbled over the luxurious carpet.
                Yet, no scream escaped her lips. Blood flowed from a split in
                her mouth, but she merely wiped it away, not even letting out a
                groan. All she did was glare at Beret with her endlessly cold
                eyes.
              </p>
              <p>“Ah…”</p>
              <p>
                Beret, whose face had turned beet red, was earnestly soothed by
                two elf slaves by his side.
              </p>
              <p>
                “Master, please calm down. It seems this child is too foolish to
                understand your mercy.”
              </p>
              <p>
                “Yes, Master. Please don’t bother with such a defective elf and
                love us instead.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Both were barely covered by thin cloth, in a provocatively
                scanty manner. The attitude of the two slaves, whispering in a
                coquettish voice, displaying a ‘desirable’ elf-like demeanor,
                somewhat eased his anger.
              </p>
              <p>“Huff…”</p>
              <p>Beret snorted and then shouted.</p>
              <p>“Steward!”</p>
              <p>
                A middle-aged man, who had been anxiously waiting outside,
                hurried into the room.
              </p>
              <p>“Yes, Young Master!”</p>
              <p>
                “Return that one. Damn, I bought it cheap, but it’s totally
                defective.”
              </p>
              <p>
                Originally, a Slayer wasn’t of much practical use relative to
                its price. For nighttime services, just buying a regular elf
                slave would suffice. For escort purposes, gladiator-born orc
                warriors could be recruited. The macho fantasy of having a
                beautiful female swordsman who loves and cherishes the master
                like her own body must be fulfilled for it to have any value.
              </p>
              <p>
                The steward helped the fallen elf girl to stand up and inwardly
                sighed in relief.
              </p>

              <p>
                ‘Seeing he’s asking for a return, he didn’t assault her.
                Thankfully, money saved.’
              </p>
              <p>
                A Slayer, once defiled, cannot be returned. This profession,
                born out of men’s foolish fantasies, wouldn’t sell if not for
                the Slayers’ virginity. With many customers attempting to
                sneakily assault and then return them, the slave traders’
                ability to discern has reached almost divine levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                Therefore, Beret ultimately didn’t touch the elf girl. No matter
                how cheaply he had bought her, it was still a significant amount
                of money due to her being a Slayer.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I should’ve added a bit more money and bought a proper one.”
              </p>
              <p>“Understood, Young Master.”</p>
              <p>
                The steward, after bowing his head, gestured to the elf girl.
              </p>
              <p>“Follow me.”</p>
              <p>
                Although her face was still streaming with coldness, the girl
                did not resist and quietly followed the steward.
              </p>
              <p>“…”</p>
              <p>
                Thus, in the Elvenheim, an elf-specialized slave auction house
                with deep history and tradition within the Principality of
                Chatan, the elf girl known as ‘Number 148’ faced her third
                return.
              </p>
              <p>
                Numerous carriages carried loads back and forth in the gray
                city, and peddlers weaved through them in disarray. The densely
                packed stone buildings all had shops on the first floor, selling
                various goods. Even those without their own shops set up stalls
                and eagerly solicited customers. On bridges, squares, and
                streets, the noisy sounds of bargaining filled the air.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two individuals were walking along the bustling streets, their
                figures cutting through the lively throngs of people. The young
                man, Repenhardt, donned a thick coat that accentuated his robust
                frame, while alongside him, a beautiful girl clad in a pristine
                white robe, her hair cascading down to her waist, walked. This
                girl, in fact, was a boy named Sillan.
              </p>
              <p>
                “This place is truly chaotic. No wonder it’s said to be the
                leading commercial city on the continent…”
              </p>
              <p>
                Sillan looked around, sticking out his tongue in disdain. The
                expressions on the faces of those around them seemed unfazed by
                the cold. Despite it being winter, the entire street was
                brimming with vitality.
              </p>
              <p>
                They had arrived at the capital of the Principality of Chatan,
                Zeppelin.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Principality of Chatan was a nation born of trade, situated
                at the junction of three kingdoms: Graim, Crovence, and the
                Vasily Kingdom. It had gained its independence and the status of
                a principality after the owner of the Chatan Commerce Guild,
                having made a fortune from trade among the three nations,
                purchased the land from the Kingdom of Graim.
              </p>
              <p>
                As such, the Principality of Chatan offered numerous privileges
                to merchants. Registered merchants enjoyed lower taxes and were
                exempt from territorial passage fees. Zeppelin, the capital of
                the Principality of Chatan, stood as a dream city for merchants,
                embodying the nation’s commercial foundation. For many wandering
                traders, establishing their own commerce guild in this city
                represented the culmination of their dreams.
              </p>
              <p>“In other words, it’s a neighborhood flushed with money.”</p>
              <p>
                Repenhardt, with a nonchalant glance around, continued to walk.
                It had taken them about ten days to arrive here from the Hattan
                mountain range. Had he been alone, the journey might have taken
                only three days, but Sillan’s presence made a difference.
                Fortunately, they had managed to hitch a ride on a cargo wagon
                halfway through, which sped up their travel.
              </p>
              <p>‘Siris is here.’</p>
              <p>
                Anxious, his pace quickened. Sillan, hurrying to keep up,
                exclaimed, “Hey, slow down! Are you showing off how long your
                legs are?”
              </p>
              <p>Though Repenhardt frowned briefly, he soon slowed down.</p>
              <p>
                Despite the delay caused by Sillan, his company had brought more
                benefits. For Repenhardt, who was neither a noble nor affiliated
                with any mercenary guilds, crossing the border into the Vasily
                Kingdom was no easy task. Without a clear identity, it was
                unlikely that the border guards would let him pass through
                without question.
              </p>
              <p>
                Initially, he had planned to secretly cross the border. However,
                Sillan’s simple declaration solved everything.
              </p>
              <p>
                “I am a pilgrim serving Philanence.” Pilgrims were allowed to
                cross all borders freely. By healing a few chronic ailments of
                the border guards with simple healing spells, they warmly
                granted passage. The act of healing itself was proof enough of
                being a clergy, leaving no room for objection.
              </p>
              <p>“Alright, we’ll go slowly.”</p>
              <p>
                Side by side, they resumed their journey, moving steadily
                forward.
              </p>

                <p>[ Chapter 26 ]</p>
                <p>
                  There was much to be done. First off, Repenhardt needed to
                  convert the goods acquired in Falton into cash. Only then
                  could he go to rescue Siris. Technically, it was more about
                  purchasing her freedom, but he found the expression
                  distasteful and chose to ignore it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  He was walking diligently from the merchant streets towards
                  the lodging district when he noticed a commotion at a tavern
                  set on one side of the street.
                </p>
                <p>“Please, spare my life!”</p>
                <p>
                  A shabby man in his fifties was being held by two sturdy men
                  and was begging for mercy. In front of him, a chubby young man
                  in his twenties, face contorted in anger, wielded a club.
                </p>
                <p>“Make sure you hold onto him tightly!”</p>
                <p>
                  The young man repeatedly struck the man with his club, who
                  couldn’t even twitch as he continued to take the hits.
                </p>
                <p>“Argh! Aaargh!”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt and Sillan stopped in their tracks, taken aback.
                  The man was brutally beaten, his face streaming with blood.
                </p>
                <p>“What’s going on here?”</p>
                <p>
                  Both were bewildered, looking around. In broad daylight, in
                  the middle of the street, a man was being beaten to death,
                  yet, no one intervened. People merely clicked their tongues
                  and went on their way. Unsure of the situation and whether
                  they should interfere, they hesitated for a moment.
                </p>
                <p>“Please, spare my life! Argh! Aaargh!”</p>
                <p>
                  As screams continued to burst forth, Repenhardt was about to
                  step forward when the chubby young man stopped beating the
                  man. He had a smug look on his face, as if satisfied.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Now, do you understand your place? How dare you insult the
                  Rolpein Trading Company?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  It appeared that the man had insulted the Rolpein Trading
                  Company and caught the young man’s attention. The Rolpein
                  Trading Company was the second largest trading company in the
                  principality.
                </p>
                <p>Repenhardt frowned, glaring at the chubby young man.</p>
                <p>
                  Clearly, the young man’s clothes and jewelry were all
                  expensive. Overall, he looked costly, if one could say that.
                  Only someone living a lavish life could gain such weight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The sturdy men threw the man aside. The young man looked down
                  at the fallen man in his fifties with an arrogant smile, then
                  gestured to his bodyguard. The bodyguard pulled a purse from
                  his waist.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Right, I’ve hit him thirty times, so thirty gold coins should
                  do, right?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  After tossing gold coins at the fallen man, the young man left
                  the scene with a laugh.
                </p>
                <p>“Now, you should understand your place, you beggar.”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt was dumbfounded. In his previous life, he had
                  encountered all sorts of lowlifes, but this was his first
                  encounter with someone so despicable. Beating a man to death,
                  throwing money at him, and then just leaving? Such behavior
                  showed a complete disregard for any repercussions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Repenhardt was astounded, Sillan quickly supported the
                  fallen man and began to heal him. The man groaned as he
                  regained consciousness.
                </p>
                <p>“Are you alright?”</p>
                <p>“Thank you, thank you!”</p>
                <p>
                  Seeing the man tearfully express his gratitude, Sillan’s
                  pretty face contorted in anger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “What about that person? Let’s go to the guard right now!”
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was broad daylight, and there were plenty of witnesses. No
                  matter how high-ranking the chubby young noble was, this was
                  not something to just let slide.
                </p>

                <p>However, the man shook his head.</p>
                <p>
                  “Even so, this will serve as capital for me to start over.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite the pain, the man eagerly collected the dropped gold
                  coins. Sillan was speechless at the sight. After picking up
                  all the coins, the man bowed repeatedly and left.
                </p>
                <p>Sillan muttered in a disheartened voice.</p>
                <p>
                  “So, just because he got paid, we’re supposed to let it go? Is
                  that it?”
                </p>
                <p>“That’s how it is around here.”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt patted Sillan’s shoulder, offering a bitter smile.
                </p>
                <p>“I can’t accept that.”</p>
                <p>As they continued walking, Sillan kept grumbling.</p>
                <p>
                  Thanks to his high divine power, Sillan, despite his young
                  age, had traveled the world quite a bit. Though he was very
                  young and thus often accompanied by older clergy, he had
                  visited many parts of the southern region of the Vasily
                  Kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                  During those travels, he had seen many powerless people
                  suffer. The tyranny of those in power was the same everywhere.
                  He had tried to help them as much as he could, and whenever
                  possible, sought to remedy their injustices.
                </p>
                <p>
                  From Sillan’s point of view, the attitude of the man who had
                  been beaten was utterly incomprehensible. Even if the
                  aggressor was a person of power, in such a situation, it was
                  more than possible to file a complaint. One could boldly make
                  their grievances known and have the perpetrator punished. Of
                  course, it was unlikely that a person of power would face
                  significant punishment, but at least the victim’s grievances
                  could be addressed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, the man seemed only interested in the money, with no
                  thought of addressing his grievances. Repenhardt shrugged.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “That’s the thing, around here, ‘punishment’ often just means
                  a fine. You pay it off, and it’s settled. No jail time or
                  anything.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  And that fine goes straight into the state’s coffers. The
                  victim doesn’t see a penny of it. From the man’s perspective,
                  picking up the money might be the better option, at least to
                  cover his healing costs.
                </p>
                <p>“What kind of country does this?”</p>
                <p>“That’s what I said, it’s a place obsessed with money.”</p>
                <p>“Really now…”</p>
                <p>
                  With a bittersweet mood enveloping them, the two entered the
                  lodging district. All around, various inns were bustling with
                  activity. As they walked in search of a suitable place to
                  stay, Sillan suddenly asked, “By the way, Repenhardt, what
                  brings you to this city?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Until now, there had been a slight awkwardness between them,
                  making it somewhat difficult to inquire about each other’s
                  business. However, having traveled together and grown closer,
                  and now that they had arrived at their destination, it seemed
                  like a good time to ask.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt showed a moment of embarrassment before muttering
                  softly, “I’ve come… to buy.”
                </p>
                <p>“Pardon?”</p>
                <p>“I’ve come to buy an elf!”</p>
                <p>At that moment, Sillan’s gaze shifted peculiarly.</p>
                <p>“Hmm, so Repenhardt is ultimately a man as well.”</p>
                <p>
                  To be frank, those coveting elf slaves all had the same goal
                  in mind. Repenhardt scratched his head vigorously.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I understand why you’d look at me that way, and I admit that
                  it might appear so, but it’s not like that.”
                </p>
                <p>“Then what is it?”</p>

                <p>
                  Seeing Sillan’s cold retort, Repenhardt scratched his head
                  even more fiercely. Unable to explain his past life, he found
                  himself at a loss for words.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Alright, let’s just say it’s that. Let’s leave it at that.”
                </p>
                <p>“Ugh, men.”</p>
                <p>
                  “You speak as if you’re not one yourself. What about you?”
                </p>
                <p>“Eh? Is that so?”</p>
                <p>
                  Sillan, who was extremely self-conscious about being perceived
                  as feminine, mumbled in confusion. Is that so? Is it normal
                  for a man to act flirtatiously towards women? Thinking about
                  it, even the martial arts masters couldn’t stop flirting
                  whenever they saw a woman in a skirt. Ah, could it be that the
                  reason my muscles aren’t growing is because I’m not flirting
                  enough?
                </p>
                <p>
                  While Sillan was oddly self-critical, Repenhardt continued to
                  look around the street. Spotting a large two-story building,
                  he pointed it out.
                </p>
                <p>“Ah, that place looks good.”</p>
                <p>
                  It was an inn called “The Golden Rest,” built with
                  high-quality stone and appearing quite luxurious.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The inn was clean and lavish. True to its name, “The Golden
                  Rest,” it seemed one needed a well-padded purse of gold to
                  dare enter. The tables in the ground floor hall were all
                  intricately crafted high-quality items, and the paintings on
                  the wall were impressive.
                </p>
                <p>Sillan looked around and clicked his tongue.</p>
                <p>
                  “This place looks really luxurious. Even if we made a lot of
                  money in Falton, it’ll quickly run out if we’re not careful…”
                </p>
                <p>
                  After Repenhardt had shown his true skills, Sir Edward had
                  given him several items salvaged from Falton. Sillan had kept
                  this in mind when he spoke. Although the value of those items
                  could cover the living expenses of a typical middle-class
                  family for a year, lavish spending like this wouldn’t last
                  long. Indeed, upon inquiry, the daily lodging cost here was as
                  much as ten silver coins.
                </p>
                <p>“It’s okay, it’s okay.”</p>
                <p>
                  To Repenhardt, who had separately saved a considerable amount,
                  this sum was negligible. After calculating Sillan’s share
                  generously in the currency of the Silver Age, he went
                  upstairs. Sillan, impressed by the apparent wealth, followed
                  him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After unpacking in a luxurious room with a large living room
                  and two small bedrooms, Repenhardt, while packing his
                  backpack, told Sillan,
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Ah, I need to step out for a bit, so wait for me at the inn.”
                </p>
                <p>“Eh? Why don’t I come with you?”</p>
                <p>“Ah, this is a bit difficult to do together…”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt trailed off, looking troubled. He was planning to
                  sell all the items he had secretly taken from Falton. The
                  secrecy was crucial. There was absolutely no way he could take
                  Sillan with him.
                </p>
                <p>‘How should I make an excuse?’</p>
                <p>
                  While Repenhardt was thinking of various excuses, Sillan
                  surprisingly didn’t pry further.
                </p>
                <p>“Alright then. Come back soon.”</p>
                <p>
                  Sillan agreed more easily than expected. Relieved, Repenhardt
                  waved his hand and quickly left the room. Left alone in the
                  empty room, Sillan suddenly took off his robe, revealing his
                  slender upper body. Smiling, he began to stretch.
                </p>
                <p>“Then, I should exercise in the room.”</p>
                <p>
                  That was why Sillan had not insisted on going with him. He
                  hadn’t found the time to exercise due to all the moving
                  around. Repenhardt had been walking all day long. Without
                  constantly replenishing his stamina with divine power, it
                  would have been impossible to keep up. And once they secured
                  lodging, he would immediately fall asleep, leaving no time or
                  energy for exercise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Imagining Repenhardt’s impressive physique is also an
                  important part of training,” Sillan thought as he began doing
                  push-ups energetically.
                </p>
                <p>“One~! Twoo~ Threee~ Fourr~!”</p>

                <p>Thud!</p>
                <p>
                  After only four, his arms trembled and he collapsed onto the
                  floor. His body was indeed in poor shape. However, Sillan
                  didn’t give up. Healing his body with divine power, he started
                  exercising again.
                </p>
                <p>“Don’t give up! Sillan! You can do it!”</p>
                <p>
                  Echoes of counting numbers resounded through the luxurious
                  room.
                </p>
                <p>* * *</p>
                <p>
                  In the walls raised of marble and the interiors adorned with
                  silver crafts, this place was known to be the most refined
                  neighborhood in the Chatan Principality, a term synonymous
                  with ‘wealthy’, frequented only by its guests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A portly young man was enjoying teatime at a table. He was
                  Teriq, the current head of the Rolpein Trading Company, the
                  second largest trading company in the Chatan Principality.
                  Having come out after a long while, he was sipping black tea,
                  wearing a pleasant smile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Indeed, the envy of the impoverished is so petty,” he
                  scoffed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A displeasing incident had occurred just a moment ago. While
                  he was strolling without a care, he stumbled upon an aged
                  peddler at the tavern, vilifying the Rolpein Trading Company.
                  Accusing it of exploiting the power of wealth to cheat the
                  smaller traders, the man was shouting in broad daylight,
                  drunk.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the owner of the Rolpein Trading Company, how could he
                  simply overlook such behavior? Naturally, he taught him a
                  lesson, which unexpectedly cost him thirty gold coins, but
                  that was mere pocket change to him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “If they feel wronged, they should just earn their own money
                  instead of swearing on the streets. Don’t you think?”
                </p>
                <p>“Indeed, Master.”</p>
                <p>
                  The elf girl seated next to him playfully agreed. The men he
                  brought as escorts were waiting outside to not dampen the
                  cafe’s atmosphere, while Teriq was having tea with only his
                  personal Slayer as company.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As they were sitting, a familiar face entered through the cafe
                  door. It was Beret, the heir to the Caron Trading Company,
                  accompanied by an elf slave in lascivious attire. Teriq was
                  momentarily puzzled by his appearance.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That elf slave, judging by her attire, was certainly not a
                  Slayer. A Slayer should be dressed in a warrior’s attire like
                  the elf girl seated next to him. Of course, there were fools
                  who desperately wanted a Slayer and would dress an elf slave
                  in warrior’s attire, but that was a disgusting sight and
                  something a cultured Chatan Principality citizen would never
                  do.
                </p>
                <p>“It’s been a long time, hasn’t it, Beret?”</p>
                <p>“Te, Teriq?”</p>
                <p>
                  Beret’s face flushed with dismay upon seeing Teriq. A smirk
                  crossed Teriq’s face as he eyed the elf slave standing beside
                  Beret.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “What’s this, Beret? Thought you bought a Slayer. Where did
                  you leave it? Keeping it at home to worship?”
                </p>
                <p>“Damn, of all places to run into this guy!”</p>
                <p>
                  Beret gritted his teeth. His main reason for causing a fuss
                  about wanting to buy a Slayer was largely because he couldn’t
                  stand Teriq’s arrogance. But he couldn’t just conjure up a
                  non-existent Slayer, so Beret sighed and responded.
                </p>
                <p>“I returned it about a fortnight ago.”</p>
                <p>“Returned?”</p>
                <p>
                  Tuniq looked puzzled, prompting Beret to explain, almost as if
                  he was lamenting. After hearing the story, Teriq burst into
                  laughter.
                </p>
                <p>“Puhahahat!”</p>
                <p>“Why laugh?”</p>
                <p>
                  “Can’t even tame one elf slave? No wonder Caron still
                  fluctuates around the 10th position in the principality, with
                  an heir like this.”
                </p>
                <p>“Ugh!”</p>
                <p>
                  Feeling humiliated, Beret clenched his teeth. He couldn’t
                  argue since there was no fault in the statement. Trying to
                  defend himself, Beret muttered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “What can you do? Turns out it had been returned three times
                  already. No wonder it was so cheap.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  A brilliant idea popped into Teriq’s head. Given that he and
                  Beret were always in a battle of pride, trying to belittle
                  each other, what would Beret’s face look like if he managed to
                  successfully train this Slayer that he had to return?
                </p>
                <p>“Huh, just you watch.”</p>
                <p>Beret rose from his seat with a defiant look.</p>
                <p>“It’s about time I visited Elvenheim again.”</p>

                <p>[ Chapter 27 ]</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt left the inn and headed straight for the business
                  district.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The relics from the Silver Age were so expensive that ordinary
                  places couldn’t even dream of purchasing them. However, this
                  was the capital of the Chatan Principality, Zeppelin. It was a
                  place teeming with major companies that could readily mobilize
                  thousands of gold coins in cash.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Choosing a major trading house nearby, Repenhardt quickly
                  liquidated his treasures. True to the worn-out merchants they
                  were, they bargained hard, but his opponents stood no chance.
                  He had already sold these items in his previous life and knew
                  their fair price by heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a cheerful heart, Repenhardt left the trading house,
                  carrying a fortune of 2,000 Chatan gold coins. Typically, such
                  amounts would be handled through bank drafts, as 2,000 gold
                  coins weren’t something ordinary people could easily carry.
                  However, Repenhardt chose to take it all in cash. To him, the
                  weight of 2,000 gold coins was nothing; even as a boy, he
                  could lift heavier stones with one hand. Moreover, with the
                  Infinite Bag, there was no issue.
                </p>
                <p>“Ha-ha, this should be enough, right?”</p>
                <p>
                  Fiddling with the backpack, Repenhardt grinned broadly.
                  Normally, he wouldn’t liquidate everything into cash, but the
                  average price for a Slayer was about a thousand gold coins. He
                  had converted everything into cash to ensure he had more than
                  enough to save Siris.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt quickened his pace. He thought about going straight
                  to Siris, but considering he had a companion waiting, he
                  decided not to make them wait too long and returned to the
                  inn.
                </p>
                <p>As he was just opening the door and entering the room,</p>
                <p>“Huh?”</p>
                <p>
                  Sillan was doing push-ups on the high-quality thuja wood
                  floor, sweating profusely. The floor was drenched with sweat,
                  indicating he had been at it for a while. Sillan didn’t even
                  stand up; he just nodded his head when Repenhardt entered.
                </p>
                <p>“Are you back? Did you finish your business?”</p>
                <p>“… What are you doing?”</p>
                <p>“Exercising, obviously.”</p>
                <p>
                  Sillan retorted as if it was the most obvious thing in the
                  world and continued focusing on his push-ups with his skinny
                  arms. Repenhardt watched blankly. He had heard about Sillan’s
                  desire to have a more masculine body, but seeing it in person…
                </p>
                <p>‘Goodness, he’s really skinny.’</p>
                <p>
                  Understanding why Sillan had become such a muscle fanatic was
                  beyond obvious. Truly, his body was incomparably frail even
                  when compared to his previous life’s self. With slender arms
                  and legs, thin shoulders, and a neck that seemed like it would
                  snap with a mere touch, even without his robe, he looked more
                  like an undernourished girl than a boy. In his past life,
                  Repenhardt was at least a reasonably healthy boy.
                </p>
                <p>‘But he’s surprisingly diligent, isn’t he?’</p>

                <p>Repenhardt found himself puzzled.</p>
                <p>
                  Muscle growth is something that, to a certain extent, anyone
                  can achieve through effort, regardless of their initial
                  physical condition. Even the weakest individuals can see some
                  results with enough dedication.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, Repenhardt had assumed that Sillan’s lack of muscle,
                  despite over five years of daily exercise, was because he
                  maybe did a few push-ups and then quit. But witnessing the
                  sweat-soaked floor from Sillan’s current workout session
                  revealed an extraordinary level of effort.
                </p>
                <p>‘Why aren’t the muscles building, then?’</p>
                <p>
                  Even a real girl, with this level of training intensity, would
                  normally start to show some muscle definition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Meanwhile, Sillan continued his workout, flexing his arms
                  rigorously until his whole body trembled as if he was having a
                  seizure. Clearly overworking himself, Repenhardt intervened.
                </p>
                <p>“Hey, overdoing it will have the opposite effect.”</p>
                <p>
                  There’s a limit to how much a frail body can handle before it
                  starts to break down. Sillan, struggling to stand, was
                  supported by Repenhardt, who frowned at him.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Hey, you’re not going to be immobilized for days because of
                  muscle soreness, are you?”
                </p>
                <p>“It’s fine. It won’t hinder our journey.”</p>
                <p>
                  Sillan managed a faint smile as he gasped for breath, showing
                  his considerate nature towards his companion. He seemed to
                  have everything figured out.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Closing his eyes for a moment, Sillan’s entire body then
                  shimmered with a pink divine glow, as if a goddess’s blessing
                  was rejuvenating the weary boy. Repenhardt’s eyes widened in
                  astonishment.
                </p>
                <p>“What are you doing now?”</p>
                <p>
                  Moments later, Sillan shrugged his shoulders with a refreshed
                  look, making his previous fatigue seem like a lie.
                </p>
                <p>“How about it, aren’t I all refreshed?”</p>
                <p>“……”</p>
                <p>
                  In an instant, Repenhardt fully understood why, despite all
                  the vigorous exercise, Sillan’s muscles weren’t developing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Hey! You idiot! What’s the point of exercising if you’re just
                  going to heal yourself with divine power afterward!”
                </p>

                <p>
                  The healing spells of clerics and the healing magic of mages
                  are fundamentally different.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A wizard’s healing spells, the healing potions made from
                  purified troll’s blood, and the medicinal herbs used by
                  doctors and alchemists all serve to amplify the body’s
                  inherent healing capabilities. In other words, they accelerate
                  the natural healing process that would occur if left alone.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast, the healing spells of priests restore individuals
                  to their original, unharmed state, akin to reversing time
                  itself. Rather than hastening the healing of wounds, priestly
                  healing spells return the individual to a state before they
                  were injured.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‘This means the guy has been doing nothing productive for the
                  last five years?’
                </p>
                <p>
                  Muscles, after being excessively strained and damaged,
                  regenerate to become even larger and more robust. But to
                  restore them to their original state with holy power? That
                  would just revert them to their pre-exercise condition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If it were possible to train the body with holy power, why
                  would Gym Unbreakable spend a fortune buying healing potions
                  and medicinal herbs to repeatedly treat and detox his
                  disciples? It would be much cheaper to just contract a
                  high-ranking priest for healing.
                </p>
                <p>‘Something did seem off…’</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt clicked his tongue at Sillan’s ignorance. However,
                  upon reflection, he was likely the only one on the continent
                  who conceptually understood this healing technique of the
                  priests.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even priests endowed with holy power understood their healing
                  simply as “people being healed by a miracle of God,” without
                  delving into the conceptual underpinnings of their healing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For wizards, the healing spell itself is a high-level,
                  7th-circle spell, so there are few who have attained such
                  mastery.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gym Unbreakable had initially tried healing its disciples with
                  holy spells but abandoned it due to lack of effectiveness, not
                  because they understood the concept and developed a training
                  method based on it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In his previous life, Ellin, known as a “saint,” demonstrated
                  miraculous healings with her formidable holy power, even
                  restoring severed limbs. Amazed by its power, Repenhardt spent
                  some time trying to replicate the effects of these divine
                  spells with magic, eventually grasping the concept.
                </p>
                <p>‘It’s understandable that Sillan doesn’t know…’</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt now understood why Sillan didn’t develop muscles or
                  why, at the age of nineteen, he was still as small as a child.
                  It was quite an achievement to grow even that much if he had
                  been doing that daily since he was twelve. Repenhardt briefly
                  considered whether to explain this to him. And then…
                </p>
                <p>‘Ah, let it be.’</p>
                <p>
                  After all, it was certain that the practice had uniformly
                  increased his holy power. And what he wanted from Sillan was
                  that powerful holy power, not muscles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt’s expression hardened, prompting Sillan to tilt his
                  head in confusion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Why are you looking at me like that? Is something wrong?”
                </p>

                <p>
                  Repenhardt quickly managed his expression and smiled softly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Huh? No, I was just a bit surprised because you’re working
                  harder than I thought.”
                </p>
                <p>“Hihihi.”</p>
                <p>
                  Sillan laughed happily at the compliment. Feeling a prick of
                  conscience for deceiving him, Repenhardt turned away from
                  Sillan. He couldn’t just leave him be; he decided it was time
                  to intermittently guide him. Just stopping him from healing
                  his body with holy power would bring about a quick change.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‘And his affection would increase, right? Finally, he would
                  start to build some muscle.’
                </p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt chuckled to himself. A high priest like Sillan had
                  many uses, so becoming friends with him would be beneficial in
                  every way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “I know a much more effective training method. I’ll teach you
                  later.”
                </p>
                <p>“Really? Thank you!”</p>
                <p>
                  Unaware of Repenhardt’s cunning thoughts, Sillan was ecstatic.
                  Once again feeling a pang of guilt, Repenhardt stealthily
                  turned his head away and changed the subject.
                </p>
                <p>“Ah, I’m going to check out the slave auction.”</p>
                <p>“Huh? Are you going alone again? I’ll come with you!”</p>
                <p>
                  Sillan clung to him, having donned his clerical robe. He had
                  done enough exercise and now wanted to explore the city. Well,
                  this wasn’t something that needed to be done in secret, so
                  there was no reason to oppose. Repenhardt readily agreed.
                </p>
                <p>“Yes, let’s go together.”</p>
                <p>
                  Among the slave races, elves were undeniably the most popular.
                  Compared to orcs or dwarves, elves fully met the human
                  standards of beauty, so their appearance alone naturally
                  increased their value, regardless of their abilities.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Humans have always been creatures whose words and actions
                  differ. Even intellectuals who harshly criticize the
                  superficiality of appearance would choose an elf over an orc
                  if asked, “Who would you pick between an elf and an orc?”
                  That’s just how humans are.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, the price of elf slaves exceeded imagination. The cost of
                  an average orc gladiator, even when the prices of ten were
                  combined, did not match the price of the cheapest young elf
                  boy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Elves were popular because of their uniquely long lifespans,
                  but this very longevity was also the biggest drawback in
                  commercializing them. An elf’s lifespan is four times that of
                  a human’s, and their growth rate is the same as humans’,
                  making their childhood four times as long. Raising a young elf
                  and waiting for it to become a useful slave with some
                  commercial value could easily take several decades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A famous joke within the Chatan Principality was about a
                  foolish merchant who thought he could make money by setting up
                  an elf auction house, only to die of old age while still
                  feeding the baby elves with bottles.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Therefore, slave auction houses dealing with elves were mostly
                  those with centuries of tradition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Elvenheim was a truly venerable elf-specialized slave auction
                  house within the Chatan Principality, boasting 300 years of
                  history and tradition. Naming an auction house that sells
                  elves as slaves after the elves’ paradise, “Elvenheim,” was
                  truly the pinnacle of irony.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, for the auction house, it was a name given in all
                  seriousness. Elvenheim had a high pride in nurturing the
                  healthiest and best-performing elves, thanks to its long
                  history and tradition of excellence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  While there were nefarious auction houses that would defile
                  elf females and then train them to appear as virgins for sale,
                  Elvenheim always sold prime virgin elves, earning a high
                  reputation for integrity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With faithful know-how, providing high-level education,
                  meticulously caring for their health, and earnestly producing
                  the finest elf slaves, the traders of Elvenheim took pride in
                  the name “Elves’ Paradise,” believing it was a title well
                  deserved.

                <p>
                  “It’s truly terrifying that they seriously believe that,”
                  Repenhardt muttered with a stern face as he looked around. He
                  was sitting in a splendid reception room, surrounded by
                  gold-leaf furniture, silk cushions, and elaborately crafted
                  pillars. It felt like a place where VIPs would be entertained,
                  yet for the Elvenheim auction house, this was just a standard
                  reception room. After all, anyone wealthy enough to buy an elf
                  slave was considered a VIP here. Such treatment was expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sillan, sitting on the sofa, kept glancing around and said,
                  “This is my first time at an elf auction house.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  While the Vasily Kingdom did have orc auction houses, there
                  were no elf or dwarf auction houses. Orcs, whose lifespans
                  were similar to humans and who reached maturity quickly, could
                  be bred and sold anywhere. However, elves and dwarves, with
                  their long lifespans, required considerable wealth and
                  recognition to be traded. Thus, Sillan had never seen an elf
                  slave auction before coming to the Chatan Principality.
                </p>
                <p>“It seems they take good care of this place, at least.”</p>
                <p>
                  Looking through the reception room window into the auction
                  house, Sillan appeared pleased. Orc auction houses were often
                  dirty and rundown, giving off the impression that the slaves
                  were treated very poorly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In contrast, the elf auction house, with its splendid and
                  clean buildings, felt like they had entered a royal palace.
                  Sillan thought the elves might actually be happy living in
                  such a place.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt, feeling suffocated, sighed repeatedly. He casually
                  asked, “Even if they are well taken care of, it’s still a life
                  of slavery. Do you really think that’s happiness?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Huh? They were originally living wild lives in the forest,
                  right? Perhaps being raised by humans, without worrying about
                  hunger or death, would make them happier?”
                </p>
                <p>“Um…….”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt closed his mouth. Even the kind-hearted Sillan
                  didn’t question the reality of elves being sold as slaves.
                  This made Repenhardt realize why his previous incarnation was
                  called a Demon King. It was natural to think that way. And he
                  also realized the mistakes of his past life.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To him, other races were beings to be cared for. He was
                  powerful and an absolute mage. He had the power to right the
                  world’s wrongs on sight.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Had he been his former self, he would have demolished this
                  auction house and freed the elves. But he couldn’t now.
                  Without magical power, he had to endure the unfairness. It was
                  infuriating, yet it also brought new enlightenment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‘Right, no matter how much I force it, people’s perceptions
                  won’t change. They would only feel fear.’
                </p>
                <p>
                  Racial integration should not have been about sheltering
                  others within one’s embrace, but rather, these races
                  themselves needed to stand up, protect themselves, and declare
                  they were not slaves. Of course, in his past life, other races
                  did attempt this, but in front of the absolute Demon King
                  Repenhardt, people only saw him. They failed to see the other
                  races behind him.

                </p>
                <p>
                  Not the Dark Empire of Demon King Repenhardt, but an empire of
                  the other races, the Antares Empire. Only then might people’s
                  long-standing perceptions change.

                  Amidst these thoughts, the door opened, and a dignified
                  middle-aged man entered the room. He was one of the slave
                  traders from Elvenheim who had guided Repenhardt and Sillan
                  here.
                </p>
                <p>“You’ve been waiting a long time, guests.”</p>
                <p>
                  Following him, twenty elven women entered calmly. The slave
                  trader proudly introduced them while lining up the elves.
                </p>

                <p>
                  “These are the Slayers, the pride of our Elvenheim auction
                  house.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The elven women were only wearing thin, mesh garments, barely
                  covering their modesty. Given the evident purpose of those
                  purchasing Slayers, showcasing their bodies was considered an
                  essential part of the sale. Sillan flinched and covered his
                  eyes at this blatant display of female bodies.
                </p>
                <p>“Uh, ugh!”</p>
                <p>
                  “Perhaps this was too much for the young lady? My apologies.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The slave trader looked embarrassed. Normally, the standard
                  was to present them naked, but since the guest had brought a
                  girl along, there was no choice. He thought he had dressed
                  them considerably (?) for the occasion, yet this reaction was
                  as seen. Normally, Sillan might have taken offense to being
                  called a young lady, but he was still unable to find a place
                  to rest his eyes and continued to look around aimlessly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‘What kind of person brings a young girl to a place like
                  this?’
                </p>
                <p>
                  The guest looked respectable on the outside but seemed to have
                  a perverted streak, the slave trader thought. Still, as a
                  veteran, he didn’t show his distaste and started describing
                  the “products.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Each one is highly trained, capable of menial tasks and
                  diligent in nocturnal duties. They are all virgins, of course.
                  We pride ourselves on being one of the most reputable places
                  in the Chatan Principality.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The elves, exposed like fish in a market, unable to even show
                  a hint of shame on their faces, presented a grotesque sight.
                  Repenhardt lamented the situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ‘To think that the descendants of great spirits, the forest
                  fairies, would be reduced to such a state!’
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, he currently lacked the power to change the regime.
                  While his strength was undoubtedly formidable, changing the
                  entire system would require an even more powerful magic.
                </p>
                <p>‘First, let’s rescue Siris.’</p>
                <p>
                  One step at a time. With that resolve, Repenhardt glanced over
                  the aligned elves. He then turned around, puzzled, to look at
                  the slave trader.
                </p>
                <p>“Are these all of Elvenheim’s slayers?”</p>
                <p>“Of course.”</p>
                <p>
                  Siris was nowhere to be seen. Surely, she should have been
                  living as a slayer in this market? Confused, Repenhardt tried
                  to recall. It was certain. Siris should definitely be here at
                  this time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Misinterpreting Repenhardt’s expression, the slave trader
                  cautiously asked,
                </p>
                <p>“Do they not meet your satisfaction?”</p>
                <p>
                  It wasn’t a matter of satisfaction. What he wanted was Siris
                  alone.
                </p>
                <p>‘But how exactly should I find Siris?’</p>
                <p>
                  Since he was the one who had given her the name Siris, she
                  would only be known by a number here. Mulling over it,
                  Repenhardt hesitantly spoke,
                </p>

                <p>
                  “Um, is there a slayer with a bit of a darker complexion?”
                </p>
                <p>“Ah, we don’t deal with Gray Elves.”</p>
                <p>
                  “Not a Gray Elf, but a High Elf with a… darker complexion, do
                  you have any like that?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Somehow, as he spoke, he felt like he had become someone
                  picking out an elf slave. The slave trader looked at
                  Repenhardt as if he was indeed a peculiar one.
                </p>
                <p>‘It seems he has a slightly perverted side after all.’</p>
                <p>
                  Many customers had come to buy elf slaves, but this was the
                  first time he had heard such an odd request. How deeply into
                  elf mania must one be to be this picky?
                </p>
                <p>
                  “You have a unique taste. You want a High Elf, but not one
                  with white skin?”
                </p>
                <p>“That’s not… I mean…”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt stammered, trying not to appear as a pervert as
                  much as possible. Of course, to no avail. Sillan looked at him
                  as if he was astonishing,
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Ah, you talk this and that about the elf slave system, and
                  now you’re being picky about types?”
                </p>
                <p>“That’s not what I…”</p>
                <p>
                  “Hmph! I knew it. I could tell when you said you came to buy
                  an elf.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Sillan snorted derisively at Repenhardt. While he spoke of the
                  slaves’ happiness and such, when it came down to actually
                  buying, his preferences were clearly reflected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Suddenly, the words of a Sister of Philanence from the
                  orphanage came to mind.
                </p>
                <p>[ All men, big or small, are perverts. ]</p>
                <p>
                  Indeed! Feeling triumphant, Sillan nodded her head. Amidst his
                  frustration, Repenhardt deliberately ignored Sillan. The slave
                  merchant chuckled and then gestured as if he had remembered
                  something.
                </p>
                <p>“Ah, there is such a Slayer, but…”</p>
                <p>Repenhardt interjected, curious, “Is there?”</p>
                <p>
                  “Well, I’ll bring her out… Oh, no, would you like to go and
                  see her? It’s a bit difficult to bring her out right now. It
                  would be a bit inconvenient to make you wait too long.”
                </p>
                <p>“It’s fine.”</p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt immediately stood up from his seat. He wanted to
                  find Siris as soon as possible. The slave merchant guided him
                  as they left the room.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the large atrium inside the auction house, Repenhardt and
                  Sillan looked around incessantly. Sillan was merely curious,
                  but Repenhardt hoped to catch a glimpse of Siris.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the central garden of the atrium, young Elves were
                  exercising with elderly Elven women. The slave merchant kindly
                  explained, “They need appropriate exercise from a young age to
                  grow into slender bodies. We develop various products, from
                  innocent and delicate types to those with ample chests and
                  slender waists, using our unique exercise methods.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Repenhardt couldn’t help but grimace at the imagination, but
                  the slave merchant, who led the way, didn’t notice. They
                  continued walking through the atrium. As they entered a
                  building connected to the atrium, they came across a dining
                  hall. It seemed to be a dining hall for slaves. Since it
                  wasn’t mealtime, the dining hall was empty, but some Elven
                  slaves inside were busy preparing food.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “At Elvenheim, we always feed the Elves with fresh vegetables
                  and high-quality grains. Elves raised on quality food emit a
                  subtle fruity fragrance from their skin.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  “We’ve heard the explanation, so please guide us quickly.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally losing his temper, Repenhardt snapped. The slave
                  merchant looked puzzled for a moment but then quickened his
                  pace. Eventually, they reached a large iron gate guarded by
                  two sturdy men. The slave merchant quickly said, “We’ve come
                  to see number 148.”
                </p>
                <p>The gate opened, revealing a large arena.</p>
                <p>“Taah!”</p>
                <p>“Haap!”</p>
                <p>
                  With a vibrant shout, the clang of metal resonated loudly
                  throughout the arena. Inside, about a dozen young elves were
                  fighting, each wielding a weapon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “These are the unripe Slayer candidates. They are trained in
                  combat like this.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an instant, Repenhardt’s eyes widened. In the middle of the
                  arena, he saw an expressionless elf girl fighting against the
                  elf children.
                </p>
                <p>“And that female is the Slayer.”</p>
                <p>
                  The elf girl dodged the children’s blades, her delicate
                  platinum hair fluttering and shining. Tears welled up in
                  Repenhardt’s eyes.
                </p>
                <p>‘Ah!’</p>
                <p>
                  Instead of the long hair from his memories, she had a short
                  bob that reached her shoulders, and despite being dressed in
                  rags that covered her body, the dazzling radiance did not lose
                  its light.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Something went wrong with her upbringing, a defective product
                  returned three times, hence unsellable to customers.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  The elf children attacked her in succession. They wielded cold
                  steel swords, but the girl had only a stick made by rolling
                  and sticking paper together. She wasn’t even given a wooden
                  sword, lest it bruise the precious merchandise.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Her skills are good, but her personality is too cold and
                  proud, which diminishes her marketability.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  With just the paper stick, she couldn’t possibly block the
                  swords. She tried to dodge, but with each attempt, the blades
                  grazed her body, staining her skin with blood. Yet, she did
                  not grimace. She simply avoided the attacks and looked for
                  openings without emotion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “We can’t sell a defective product, and we can’t just dispose
                  of something we’ve invested money into, so she’s used as a
                  practice target to develop the children’s combat instincts.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even as she staggered from malnutrition, in a decidedly
                  disadvantageous situation, the elf girl did not lose her
                  fighting spirit and continued to engage in the duel.
                </p>
                <p>
                  “Surely, teaching swordsmanship involves directly hitting and
                  cutting flesh as an important experience, doesn’t it?”
                </p>
                <p>
                  Despite bleeding from wounds all over her body and barely able
                  to walk, she still did not give up and devotedly faced the
                  present.
                </p>
                <p>Repenhardt moaned and murmured,</p>
                <p>“Si, Siris…….”</p>

                  <p>[ Chapter 29 ]</p>
                  <p>
                    In a dark basement filled with various bottles of potions,
                    strange herbs, the corpses of animals, and rare ores stuffed
                    on every shelf, a middle-aged man and an elven woman were
                    carefully transferring reagents into a flask. It was
                    Repenhardt and Siris, deeply engrossed in a magic
                    experiment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of their usual clean clothes, both wore shabby
                    outfits, flipping through thick books with utmost
                    seriousness as they mixed the reagents.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Suddenly, Siris exclaimed with wide eyes, “Oh? You shouldn’t
                    mix that now!”
                  </p>
                  <p>“Huh?”</p>
                  <p>
                    Her warning came a tad too late. Repenhardt was already
                    tilting the test tube, causing red liquid to fall onto a
                    green ore.
                  </p>
                  <p>Boom!</p>
                  <p>
                    A mild explosion followed, filling the area with black
                    smoke. Siris coughed, waving away the smoke.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Oh, Repenhardt! It exploded after all!”</p>
                  <p>“Why did it explode?”</p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt scratched his head. Despite the explosion, there
                    was no reaction from outside the basement. Explosions in a
                    mage’s laboratory were so common that the dwarf soldiers
                    guarding outside the mage tower didn’t even bat an eye.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Ah, His Majesty has caused another explosion?’</p>
                  <p>‘Why does he always do this after each experiment?’</p>
                  <p>‘I don’t know, mages live like that’</p>
                  <p>
                    In the midst of the smoky aftermath, Siris’s continuous
                    scolding was like rapid gunfire.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “How could you mix flame grass extract with Sidam? I told
                    you not to do that!”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    She began to scold him more intensely, hands on her hips,
                    while Repenhardt rubbed his palms together guiltily.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Sorry… It seemed like it would work, well.”</p>
                  <p>
                    “You said the same thing yesterday and it exploded right
                    away!”
                  </p>
                  <p>-Whine</p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt turned into a scolded puppy, sneakily glancing
                    around. Eventually, Siris couldn’t help but chuckle at his
                    behavior.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Ah, why is this person so adorable despite his age!’</p>
                  <p>
                    It’s worth noting that women’s standards for cuteness are
                    significantly different from men’s. In fact, it’s an area
                    completely incomprehensible to men. Siris genuinely found
                    the dejected middle-aged man cute and chuckled, pulling out
                    a handkerchief.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Come here. Your face is all black.”</p>
                  <p>“Umm…….”</p>

                  <p>
                    Repenhardt, feigning indifference, allowed his face to be
                    cleaned by her. As he submitted to her care, he frowned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “But when will you stop calling me ‘sir’? Can’t you just
                    call me by my name?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt’s complaint was met with Siris shaking her head
                    modestly.
                  </p>
                  <p>“I can’t.”</p>
                  <p>“Why?”</p>
                  <p>
                    Siris did not answer. She simply smiled gently at her
                    bewildered lover. Her smile was so beautiful that Repenhardt
                    forgot his complaints. Just the affectionate look directed
                    at him was enough to satisfy everything.
                  </p>
                  <p>The one he loved was right in front of him.</p>
                  <p>The one he had longed for was right before his eyes.</p>
                  <p>
                    Her face was much younger than he remembered, but still,
                    there wasn’t a single unfamiliar feature about her.
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, that cold voice was all too strange.</p>
                  <p>“So, you’re my new master.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Having finished a fight at the call of the slave trader,
                    Siris was looking at Repenhardt with a cold gaze. Though
                    seemingly indifferent, her eyes deep down held boundless
                    contempt. He looked down at her with regret.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Ah…”</p>
                  <p>
                    The image of her from his past life overlaid in his mind,
                    causing a cold wind to blow through his heart. She had never
                    looked at him with such eyes before. Despite the
                    overwhelming longing that finally brought his lover before
                    him, she only glared at him as if he were a disgusting bug.
                  </p>
                  <p>“How much must she have suffered…”</p>
                  <p>
                    Deciding he needed to take Siris away, Repenhardt caught the
                    slave trader’s cautiously posed question.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Will you purchase this girl?”</p>
                  <p>“Of course!”</p>
                  <p>
                    The slave trader looked even more puzzled at the firm
                    response. Honestly, this elf girl, with her many flaws and
                    dirty clothes, didn’t seem like something that would incite
                    a desire to buy. Yet, his attitude was so decisive.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Truly, a pervert is different in every way.’</p>
                  <p>
                    Pervert or not, he was a valuable customer. Especially one
                    that took some stock clearance off his hands! The slave
                    trader’s face brightened.
                  </p>
                  <p>He respectfully bowed.</p>
                  <p>“That will be 300 gold coins.”</p>
                  <p>
                    In truth, it was 200 gold coins, but seeing how smitten the
                    customer seemed with Slayer 148, he couldn’t resist the
                    temptation to make a little extra.
                  </p>
                  <p>Standing by, Sillan was surprised and asked,</p>

                  <p>
                    “Only 300 gold coins? That’s incredibly cheap, isn’t it?”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “Well, it’s not exactly prime merchandise. I’m selling it
                    because the customer insists, but I wouldn’t recommend it
                    myself.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The slave trader answered surprisingly honestly. He was a
                    merchant who adhered to his own code of ethics. Though he
                    had sneakily added an extra 100 gold coins, the value of an
                    item truly does vary from person to person, and charging
                    more to someone who truly wants it is the true way of
                    commerce.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Of course, Repenhardt wasn’t concerned about the amount at
                    all. He just wanted to get Siris out of there as quickly as
                    possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>“I’ll take her with me.”</p>
                  <p>
                    The slave trader, seemingly remembering something as he
                    hurried, asked, “Ah, shall I call a priest? Of course, we
                    should take care of removing any blemishes…”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    To provide the best elves, the Elvenheim Auction House had a
                    long-term contract with the Neptune Order, which worshiped
                    Nephyrias, the goddess of the sea and embrace. Upon calling,
                    they would immediately come to thoroughly heal the injuries
                    of Slayer 148.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Originally, they hadn’t bothered with treatment, thinking
                    the product unsellable. But now that it was sold, it was
                    only right as a merchant to provide the best quality
                    possible.
                  </p>
                  <p>“No need!”</p>
                  <p>
                    However, Repenhardt immediately refused. He wanted nothing
                    from this filthy place. After all, with Sillan there,
                    healing wounds was hardly an issue.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt turned to look at Siris. His cold expression
                    softened remarkably. He called out to her with a gentle
                    voice, “Let’s go.”
                  </p>
                  <p>“Yes.”</p>
                  <p>
                    With eyes that had lost hope in everything, she followed
                    behind Repenhardt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt’s group quickly left the Elvenheim Auction House.
                    They dashed out as if fleeing, to the extent that Sillan
                    grumbled about why they were in such a hurry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stepping out onto the street, they finally seemed to come to
                    their senses. Repenhardt caught his breath.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Phew…”</p>
                  <p>
                    Though he didn’t show it, he was actually enraged the moment
                    he saw Siris. Seeing her injured and bleeding, his blood
                    boiled to the top of his head, blinding him with anger. For
                    a moment, his fist even moved about 10 centimeters. Had it
                    moved 30 centimeters more, the slave trader would have been
                    headless. It was only his years of experience that allowed
                    him to regain his composure, narrowly avoiding a massacre.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    But now, out in the cold air, his mind cleared
                    significantly. He turned to look at Siris. Rushed out in her
                    bloodied and tattered state, she looked miserable.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Sillan, could you please do some healing?”</p>
                  <p>“I’m already on it.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Sillan replied brusquely. Siris, now fully healed, looked
                    noticeably more comfortable, though she was still trembling
                    slightly. Repenhardt momentarily puzzled, then realized,
                    ‘Ah, she must be feeling the cold now.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Elves, living in harmony with nature, typically do not feel
                    heat or cold, but that is the story of fairies living in the
                    forest and masters of spirit magic. Siris, having lived as a
                    slave, had not yet acquired such skills.
                  </p>
                  <p>Repenhardt immediately took off his coat for her.</p>
                  <p>
                    “It must be cold, I’m sorry. For now, wear this at least.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Internally, Siris sneered. Was she expected to tremble with
                    gratitude because her master had deigned to offer a slave
                    his worn clothes? She knew exactly what was expected of her,
                    but she had no intention of playing along.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    She would act as a slave should. However, she resolved not
                    to live with the heart of one. With that determination, she
                    promptly reached out, took the coat, and draped it over
                    herself. She had complied immediately, just as a slave
                    would.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    ‘Seems like he’s trying to show off in this cold, let’s see
                    how long he keeps it up.’
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Yet, surprisingly, this new, well-built owner didn’t seem to
                    feel the cold at all, despite only wearing a simple woolen
                    top in the biting frost as if it were merely a spring
                    breeze. His expression showed nothing but contentment that
                    Siris was no longer cold.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Is he really not cold?’</p>
                  <p>
                    To call it pretense seemed wrong; there wasn’t a hint of
                    goosebumps on his skin. Siris slightly stuck out her tongue.
                    Leading the way, Repenhardt said, “Let’s go buy some clothes
                    first.”
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The three of them moved towards the commercial district. The
                    cold wind quickened their pace. Truthfully, the cold
                    hastened the steps of Sillan and Siris, while Repenhardt
                    walked as usual. The difference in their leg lengths meant
                    their walking speed was now aligned.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As they walked, Repenhardt suddenly asked, “You don’t have a
                    name yet, do you?”
                  </p>
                  <p>“Yes.”</p>
                  <p>
                    She had been returned three times and had once been given a
                    name, but she had long since erased it from her memory.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Um, how about… Siris?”</p>
                  <p>“My name is Siris, then. Understood.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Siris nodded curtly, her face somehow appearing displeased,
                    causing Repenhardt to cautiously observe her reaction.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Is it okay? Do you like it?”</p>
                  <p>“……?”</p>
                  <p>
                    Siris looked at Repenhardt as if she didn’t understand. What
                    did it matter to a slave whether they liked their name or
                    not? Was he suggesting he would change it if she didn’t like
                    it?
                  </p>
                  <p>“My name is Siris, I’ll remember that.”</p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt was anxious about her still cold demeanor. Was
                    that her way of saying she liked the name? Ah, understanding
                    women’s hearts, be it in a past life or this one, remains a
                    challenge!
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Regardless, since there was no strong objection, he named
                    her as he had in his ‘past life’.
                  </p>
                  <p>“Then from now on, you are Siris Valencia.”</p>
                  <p>
                    In his previous life, she had been profoundly moved by this
                    moment. There was no owner in the world who would give a
                    slave a surname. However, the current Siris merely looked
                    indifferent.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    “A surname is unnecessary for a slave. Is it perhaps your
                    surname?”
                  </p>
                  <p>“No, it’s a surname meant for you.”</p>
                  <p>“……?”</p>
                  <p>
                    She couldn’t grasp what he meant. A flicker of curiosity
                    arose, but Siris quickly dismissed it. After all, she was
                    certain this man would return her in a few days, irritated
                    and frustrated. There was no reason to invest interest in
                    someone irrelevant.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Repenhardt, gesturing towards himself and Sillan, continued
                    softly, “I’m Repenhardt. This is Sillan, and a priest of
                    Philanence.”
                  </p>
                  <p>“Understood.”</p>
                  <p>Siris nodded curtly, her face expressionless.</p>
                  <p>
                    The owner of the Elvenheim Auction House, Rakus, was
                    engaging in what he considered the most enjoyable part of
                    his day, counting the gold coins in his safe. The elf slave
                    business required a significant initial investment, but the
                    returns were enormous. Though the start was tough, once on
                    track, failure was virtually impossible.
                  </p>
                  <p>‘Unless all men in the world become eunuchs or saints.’</p>
                  <p>
                    Having become the 14th successor and owner of the auction
                    house within a tradition spanning 300 years, Rakus felt his
                    life was blissful. He had heard that the ancestors who
                    started the auction house faced many hardships, but having
                    inherited the business comfortably, he had no such troubles.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    No matter how noble the teachings spread by various orders,
                    men of the world never become saints. Thus, his business
                    would thrive eternally!

                    <p>[ Chapter 30 ]</p>
                    <p>
                      In the midst of Rakus’s busy time, one of his servants
                      announced the arrival of a distinguished guest. At the
                      mention of the name, Rakus was so startled that he stopped
                      counting his gold and rushed outside.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In the reception room, a plump young man in flashy clothes
                      was waiting with a grimace. Rakus hurriedly bowed his
                      head.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Ah, Teriq, welcome.”</p>
                    <p>
                      As the successor to the Rolpein Trading Company, the
                      second most influential trading company in the
                      principality, and the biggest customer of the Elvenheim
                      auction house, now was not the time to be counting money.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Teriq softened his expression at Rakus’s polite greeting.
                    </p>
                    <p>“How have you been, Rakus?”</p>
                    <p>
                      “It seems it has been three months. How are things going
                      for you?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “A new trading company named Taoban has been a bit
                      bothersome, but no major problems.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Taoban had recently emerged, dealing mainly in grains,
                      which led to minor disputes with the Rolpein Trading
                      Company. Although the Rolpein Trading Company handled a
                      wide range of goods, its main focus was on grains and
                      salt. With overlapping territories, Taoban kept
                      encroaching on their market.
                    </p>
                    <p>“So, I’ve been applying some pressure.”</p>
                    <p>
                      It was a standard practice to suppress annoyances with
                      money. Rakus understood immediately and let out a hearty
                      laugh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “With your skills, Teriq, I’m sure you’ll handle it
                      easily. Ha ha.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After exchanging pleasantries, Rakus quickly got to the
                      point.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “You’ve come at a good time. I’ve been raising a female
                      elf that I wanted to show you.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Surprisingly, Teriq shook his head.</p>
                    <p>
                      “Ah, not this time. I came because I want something
                      specific.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      With a slightly furrowed brow, the plump young man looked
                      intently at Rakus.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I heard there was a Slayer that Beret returned a while
                      ago?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rakus immediately knew what he was talking about. He
                      couldn’t be unaware of a major failure that had been
                      returned three times, ultimately being sold at a loss.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Number 148?”</p>
                    <p>
                      “I wouldn’t know the number you’ve assigned it, would I?
                      Anyway, that one. Give it to me.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Teriq gestured as if asking Rakus to bring a bottle of
                      liquor from the cabinet. Under normal circumstances, Rakus
                      would have rejoiced…
                    </p>
                    <p>“Ah, that…”</p>
                    <p>Watching Rakus looking troubled, Teriq was puzzled.</p>
                    <p>“Huh? Is there a problem?”</p>

                    <p>“The thing is, number 148 has already been sold.”</p>
                    <p>“What?”</p>
                    <p>“It was sold just now, less than an hour ago.”</p>
                    <p>
                      Teriq was astonished. Normally, Slayers were so expensive
                      that they didn’t sell easily. Selling three in a year was
                      considered a huge success. Well, elves do have a much
                      longer ‘shelf life’, so eventually, everything gets sold.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘But it’s already sold? Such a coincidence?’</p>
                    <p>
                      “Could it be that Beret noticed what I was thinking and
                      bought it again?”
                    </p>
                    <p>“No, it wasn’t Lord Beret………….”</p>
                    <p>Rakus shook his head.</p>
                    <p>“It was a young man I’ve never seen before.”</p>
                    <p>“Eh? What was his name?”</p>
                    <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
                    <p>
                      “How can you not know? Didn’t he sign something when
                      paying with a banknote?”
                    </p>
                    <p>“Well, the thing is, he paid entirely in cash.”</p>
                    <p>
                      “Huh, to carry around enough money to buy a Slayer in
                      cash?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Even those flush with cash wouldn’t carry around hundreds
                      of gold coins in cash. After all, everything can be
                      settled with high-credit banknotes from the Rolpein
                      Trading Company, so there’s no need to carry around heavy
                      cash. Those affluent enough to buy a Slayer would all do
                      the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “That Slayer was a defective product, so we just let it go
                      at a bargain price. That seems to be the reason.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“Eh…….”</p>
                    <p>
                      Given the payment was made in cash, it seems a novice
                      adventurer struck gold by fulfilling his dream on a whim.
                      He must have been swayed by the cheap price.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Then tell me what the buyer looked like.”</p>
                    <p>
                      Teriq thought he should buy back the returned elf.
                      Initially, the plan was to tease Beret, but hearing it had
                      already been sold to someone else made him greedier. Teriq
                      always got what he wanted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘Just pay a bit extra, and they’ll happily hand it over.
                      What in the world can’t be done with money?’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Faced with Teriq’s demand, Rakus hesitated for a moment.
                      It was the merchant’s code not to disclose the personal
                      details of a client. It could potentially damage
                      Elvenheim’s reputation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, no matter how venerable an auction house
                      Elvenheim was, it couldn’t compare to the Rolpein Trading
                      Company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘He seemed like a newcomer, so it probably won’t cause a
                      big problem.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “It should be easy to find him. He was a rather large
                      young man.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Having made up his mind, Rakus slowly described
                      Repenhardt’s appearance.
                    </p>
                    <p>* * *</p>

                    <p>
                      Repenhardt, having found the largest and most extravagant
                      clothing store in Zeppelin, pressed the owner to bring
                      everything suitable for Siris to wear, regardless of the
                      cost. The scent of money made the clothing store owner
                      gleefully bring various expensive women’s clothing
                      incessantly.
                    </p>
                    <p>“How about it? Do you like anything?”</p>
                    <p>
                      Repenhardt asked for her opinion. Of course, Siris only
                      responded indifferently.
                    </p>
                    <p>“As you wish, my lord.”</p>
                    <p>
                      “No, it has to be something you like, what’s the point if
                      I’m the only one who lilies it………….”
                    </p>
                    <p>“As you wish, my lord.”</p>
                    <p>
                      Siris repeated the same words like a parrot, making
                      Repenhardt uncomfortable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It seemed he wanted to buy her fancy clothes and receive
                      gratitude, which honestly, she found laughable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘Did he think buying expensive clothes would make me feel
                      touched?’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She didn’t find it odd at all that he was buying her these
                      expensive clothes. After all, buying an elf slave and
                      dressing them up in fancy clothes was a common occurrence.
                      There were plenty in the world who bought beautiful elves
                      to dress them up like dolls, enjoy the sight, and then
                      undress them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Repenhardt inwardly clicked his tongue at her icy
                      demeanor.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Well, it’s not like she’ll open up right away.’</p>
                    <p>
                      To him, Siris was a lover he had loved for decades, but to
                      her, he was a stranger she had met for the first time
                      today. It was natural for her to act this way. Though he
                      felt slighted, he could understand it completely.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘It’ll get better with time.’</p>
                    <p>
                      Regardless, he had to buy the clothes. He began to
                      seriously choose various items.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘What color did Siris like?’</p>
                    <p>
                      Repenhardt recalled the preferences of her from his past
                      life, picking out clothes she would like one by one. Men
                      usually only know their lovers’ favorite color when it
                      comes to their clothing preferences. It’s rare for them to
                      remember the details. So, he had trouble remembering and
                      even used ‘artificial recap’ to recall as much as he
                      could.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It was a bizarre scene as a burly man carefully assessed
                      each piece of women’s clothing. The intention was good,
                      but to others, it looked rather perverted. Sillan was so
                      embarrassed he stayed far away.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Ah, just pick something roughly.”</p>
                    <p>
                      It looked as if he was meticulously dressing a slave from
                      head to toe according to his own tastes. Why else would it
                      take so long to choose each piece of clothing? If he were
                      buying clothes for a lover, it might seem like a sincere
                      gesture considering the tastes of the beloved (and indeed
                      it was), but the one being dressed was an elf slave.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But Repenhardt maintained a frighteningly serious
                      demeanor. It seemed as if Sillan’s complaints fell on deaf
                      ears. Siris tilted her head in curiosity at the sight of
                      him diligently choosing clothes.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘It’s a bit… strange, isn’t it?’</p>
                    <p>
                      The clothes Repenhardt selected were entirely focused on
                      the wearer’s convenience. He completely avoided flashy or
                      sexy attire, opting instead for practical, durable, and
                      comfortable choices. It was baffling. If they were going
                      to be taken off anyway, why bother with how they felt to
                      wear?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Eventually, Repenhardt purchased various colored
                      undergarments, several high-quality dresses for everyday
                      wear, and for travel, blouses and black trousers, along
                      with two pairs of boots and jackets made of deer leather.
                      All the items were of the highest quality, the kind
                      usually worn by the nobility. When Siris changed into
                      these clothes and emerged, the shabby appearance of a
                      slave was gone, replaced by the dignified look of a noble
                      ready to embark on a journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>“How does it fit? Does it feel right?”</p>
                    <p>
                      Moving slightly, Siris was genuinely moved. Though she had
                      been sold from place to place and had worn many elaborate
                      dresses, she had never worn anything as comfortable and
                      fitting as this. It was truly luxurious. Others had only
                      thought about undressing her, dressing her in gaudy
                      dresses that were actually cheap.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Moreover, she loved the colors and the designs. It was as
                      if they perfectly matched her tastes.
                    </p>

                    <p>‘Good…’</p>
                    <p>
                      However, despite her internal approval, her expression
                      remained cold. Even if things were a bit unexpected, it
                      wasn’t enough reason to think highly of this young man.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Seeing Siris’s still cold demeanor, Repenhardt scratched
                      his head, wondering if he had misunderstood something.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Um, I’ll get you even better things later. For now, just
                      wear these, even if they’re not perfect.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Siris frowned, puzzled by his seemingly nonsensical
                      statement after buying such fine clothes. She wondered if
                      it was another one of his pretenses. Men!
                    </p>
                    <p>But Repenhardt was sincere.</p>
                    <p>
                      In her past life, Siris wouldn’t wear anything made by
                      humans during her travels. Her entire body was covered in
                      artifacts from the Silver Age, such as boots with spatial
                      movement magic, trousers that activated force fields, and
                      survival jackets with absolute survival spells. Even her
                      underwear was enchanted by Repenhardt, who labored for a
                      month to make it perfectly absorb all moisture and waste,
                      providing the wearer with the ultimate comfort. These
                      items were considered higher grade than the magical sword
                      Altion. She literally wore a fortress.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Therefore, compared to those, it was inevitable that these
                      unenchanted clothes would feel inferior. Repenhardt
                      muttered an apology to himself.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘Just bear with it a little, Siris. I’ll soon scour the
                      dungeons and gather everything.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      After gathering the remaining clothes, Repenhardt carried
                      the luggage himself. Leaving the slave Siris to carry
                      nothing felt odd to her, but she said nothing, thinking it
                      pointless to bother about what whims her soon-to-be former
                      owner might have.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Siris, aren’t you hungry?”</p>
                    <p>
                      As they left the store, Repenhardt asked again. Siris
                      frowned slightly. This master was indeed strange,
                      constantly inquiring about the desires of a slave.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘It’s as if he’s treating me like a human woman.’</p>
                    <p>
                      Of course, she didn’t care. As before, Siris repeated her
                      response like a parrot.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Do as you wish, Master.”</p>
                    <p>“Um, don’t really think of me as your master…”</p>
                    <p>“Would you like to return me?”</p>
                    <p>“No, that’s not what I mean…”</p>
                    <p>
                      Irritated by the sudden mention of returning her,
                      Repenhardt clicked his tongue. Ah, how should he explain
                      this?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I just wish you’d see me as a companion for the journey.
                      So, could you not call me ‘Master’ and use my name
                      instead?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Siris felt all her suspicions clear away like mist in the
                      sunlight at Repenhardt’s sincere words.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Ah, was that the setting?’</p>
                    <p>
                      It seemed she finally understood why he had been acting so
                      strangely. This large young man was treating her as if she
                      were a comrade female knight from an old adventure tale.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Adventure tales often left such a mark on people that many
                      who dreamed of becoming adventurers aspired to have a
                      beautiful female knight as a companion. This was also why
                      the job class “Slayer” came into existence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Of course, in none of those adventure tales did an elf of
                      a slave race appear as the beautiful female knight, but
                      realistically, since beautiful female knights hardly
                      existed, there were quite a few who took up elves as their
                      substitutes. It seemed this man was deep into such
                      role-playing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘Well, it’s not bad to follow him for a while as thanks
                      for the nice clothes. In a few days, he’ll realize his
                      fantasy differs from reality and will probably start
                      causing a fuss about returning me.’
                    </p>
                    <p>Siris nodded obediently.</p>
                    <p>“Yes, I’ll call you Repenhardt.”</p>
                    <p>‘Uh…’</p>
                    <p>
                      That was the voice he had longed to hear. Although it was
                      cold, it was still the title from his memories. A wave of
                      nostalgia and excitement washed over him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Repenhardt began looking for a restaurant, unaware that
                      Siris was following him with a look of disdain.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Humans are all the same, after all.’</p>
