          <p>[ Chapter 51 ]</p>
          <p>
            Under the red sunset blanketing Kelberen Castle’s garden, a young
            man with a frosty demeanor was swinging his sword over the withered
            lawn. Holding a sharp bastard sword with both hands, he lifted it
            above his head. In an instant, his gaze turned fierce, cutting
            through the air with a flash of light. It was a simple downward
            slash, yet the precision in posture, breathing, and timing made the
            intermediate motion invisible. Had a master of the sword witnessed
            it, they would not have spared their praise for this excellent
            strike.<br />
            It was then that two young knights approached the garden, frowning
            upon seeing Russ.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, Russ. What was that foolish act yesterday all about?”</p>
          <p>
            They were referring to Russ’s reckless charge during the appearance
            of a demon the previous day. It was an act that endangered not just
            Russ but the entire Tenes Knight Order. Naturally, they couldn’t
            remain silent about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Russ continued swinging his sword as if he hadn’t heard
            them. One of the knights, Sir Harris, exclaimed in frustration.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You idiot! If you’re going to act on your own, the least you could
            do is apologize!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ then turned around, his gaze chillingly cold as he looked at
            Sir Harris.
          </p>
          <p>“I was merely trying to take down that demon.”</p>
          <p>
            His attitude showed no hint of realization that he might have
            endangered his comrades. Another knight, Sir Patain, clenched his
            teeth and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Who asked you to take on that demon?”</p>
          <p>
            Both were visibly frustrated. Russ was always like this, always
            disobeying orders and acting on his own whim, yet facing no
            repercussions because he was favored by the head of the family,
            Count Tenes. Russ, a mere bastard, was oddly cherished by Polt
            Tenes, even against the strong objections of Sir Eusus, to the
            extent of including him in the Tenes Knights Order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naturally, no one in the Tenes Knights Order liked Russ. Even if it
            weren’t for the respect they held for their captain, Sir Eusus, this
            gloomy-faced young man in his twenties was simply not likable.
            Despite being a bastard, he acted as though he were a noble,
            dismissing others without proper socialization and relying solely on
            the favor of the head of the family to act recklessly. This time,
            too, he had disobeyed orders and charged at Sephiatan on his own
            accord.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Didn’t you hear the order to wait until the leader arrives, you
            brat?”
          </p>
          <p>
            At that, Russ turned his head sharply and muttered under his breath.
          </p>
          <p>“… I, too, am a sword of Tenes.”</p>
          <p>
            The expressions of Sir Harris and Sir Patain twisted simultaneously.
            Facing them, Russ narrowed his eyes and retorted in a chilling
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>“If you have a complaint, request a duel. I will accept it.”</p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Both seemed ready to draw their swords at any moment. However, they
            ultimately did not.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t simply because Russ was of the Tenes family’s bloodline.
            To them, that bloodline meant little more than being a bastard, and
            besides the family head, everyone disliked him. There would hardly
            be any punishment for cutting him down in a duel. In fact, Sir Eusus
            might even secretly praise them for it.
          </p>

          <p>Yet, they did not draw their swords, and the reason was simple.</p>
          <p>Russ was strong.</p>
          <p>
            The swordsmanship he had learned was only one: a downward slash,
            along with the corresponding breathing technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            His other sword techniques were all clumsy. However, this clumsiness
            was only in the eyes of someone as powerful as Eusus. To the average
            knight, his skills were more than formidable.
          </p>
          <p>“Filthy mongrel…”</p>
          <p>
            The knights, grinding their teeth, finally turned away with snorts
            of disdain. Watching them leave with a cold gaze, Russ took up his
            sword again and assumed his stance, then he slashed downwards.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a perfect breath, the blade cut through the air, tracing a
            flawless trajectory.
          </p>
          <p>
            A satisfying sensation flowed through his arms, filling his entire
            body.
          </p>
          <p>This time, he changed his stance and slashed horizontally.</p>
          <p>
            A clumsy breath, a clumsy strike brushed the air. It might appear
            powerful to ordinary knights, but for Russ, who knew perfection, it
            was an utterly unsatisfying blow.
          </p>
          <p>Curses flowed from his lips.</p>
          <p>“Damn it…”</p>
          <p>
            He didn’t understand. No matter how much he practiced, he couldn’t
            grasp how to execute other moves as perfectly as the downward slash.
          </p>
          <p>
            A sensation almost within reach yet incomplete. Something was
            missing. No matter how much he swung his sword, that missing piece
            remained unfilled.
          </p>
          <p>The words of his father, Polt Tenes, came to mind.</p>
          <p>-I’m sorry, my son. This is all I can give you now.</p>
          <p>
            Even if they had forgotten true swordsmanship, the Count Tenes
            family was a noble house of knights, naturally possessing sword
            techniques for their knights. However, Russ was unable to learn
            them. Those techniques belonged not to the Tenes but to their
            vassals, and all the vassals opposed teaching their sword techniques
            to someone who was merely a bastard. Thus, his father could only
            impart one thing to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is the swordsmanship originally possessed by our family, the
            fragment of that great sword.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The only remaining downward strike technique was still a part of
            Tenes’ swordsmanship. Hence, even the loyal retainers could not
            oppose teaching it to Russ. That downward strike was the only thing
            he could learn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ had no choice. The magical armor, Eldrad, belonged to Eusus.
            The powerful force capable of facing aura users was not bestowed
            upon him. What was given to him were mere incomplete remnants of the
            past.
          </p>
          <p>Now, it was a swordsmanship no one sought, considered trash.</p>
          <p>“But it’s also the true path to the aura.”</p>

          <p>
            Once a true sword capable of drawing great power, properly mastered,
            it could become a true Tenes sword. Not a shameful warrior who
            borrows the power of magical tools, but one who could wield the
            sword of a great knight.
          </p>
          <p>“You might be able to awaken this forgotten power.”</p>
          <p>
            His father had hoped so. And Russ did not want to let down that
            expectation.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it was a path that could never be reached with just a
            single downward strike. No matter how much he searched for it, swung
            his sword again and again, the fragments of the lost swordsmanship
            never resurfaced.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Eventually, Russ threw his sword and screamed out in frustration,
            his chest feeling as if it would burst.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            On the second floor of a building constructed of gray bricks, beyond
            the windows overgrown with dried ivy, Eusus silently looked outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the coldness of the setting sun, he saw Russ dedicated to his
            training in the corner of the backyard. Eusus frowned.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmph…”</p>
          <p>
            In Eusus’ eyes, looking at his half-brother, there was nothing but
            hatred and contempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            His father, Polt Tenes, was a cold man. Whether dealing with him or
            his mother, the Countess of Tenes, he always showed a business-like
            and cold demeanor.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a child, he didn’t find it particularly strange. He simply
            thought of it as the cool demeanor befitting a warrior. Although he
            felt sorry seeing his mother cry secretly at night, he didn’t hate
            his father for it.
          </p>
          <p>
            He began to hate his father 15 years ago, right after his mother
            passed away, when he heard that he had a half-brother.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was not unusual for nobles to have one or two illegitimate
            children. Therefore, the existence of a half-brother was not
            particularly surprising. However, the expression on his father’s
            face when he met that brother was shockingly different.
          </p>
          <p>
            His usual cold expression was nowhere to be seen. Looking at Russ,
            Count Eusus von Tenes wore a face full of affection and love, the
            very picture of a ‘father’. The sight of him bringing his mistress
            into the family made one doubt whether this man was indeed the
            father they knew.
          </p>
          <p>It was then that he realized.</p>
          <p>
            That his father was not inherently cold-hearted. His father’s cold
            demeanor was reserved solely for himself, and his mother, the
            Countess of Tenes. Originally, his father was a passionate man who,
            in his youth, even attempted to elope with Russ’s mother, Eiri.
            Despite the failure and the strategic marriage to his mother, he
            continued to secretly meet Eiri whenever possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            His father did not love his mother. The only woman he ever loved was
            Eiri.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nor did he love his son. The only child he truly cherished was the
            one born from the woman he held in his heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the heir to the family, he was forced into a strategic marriage,
            separating from his love. Outsiders might sympathize with the
            father, seeing it as a beautiful and sad tale of love.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, this story utterly ignores the grief of the legitimate wife
            and her children. Even if the marriage was bound by a family pact,
            the mother strived to love her husband. As his wife and the lady of
            the Count house, she lived a life without shame.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Is this how you repay my mother, by bringing that mongrel into our
            house as soon as she passes, father!’
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus clenched his fist unconsciously. The mere thought of his
            deceased mother and the contemptible woman who took her place filled
            him with rising anger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately after his mother’s death, his father brought Eiri into
            the Count house, along with her son. Despite being a bastard, he
            acknowledged him as his legitimate son, even bestowing upon him a
            knighthood against the family’s opposition. This current expedition
            was no different, forcing him into the exploration team despite
            everyone’s objections. No matter the love, such actions were
            unbefitting of nobility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s gaze on Russ, a thorn in his side, suddenly turned cold.
          </p>
          <p>
            The perfect trajectory of Russ’s downward slash was vividly captured
            in the eyes of Eusus, a swordsman.
          </p>
          <p>
            The movement, sharp and smooth as if splitting the space itself,
            remained chillingly perfect in its execution. Eusus bit his lip.
          </p>
          <p>“Indeed…”</p>
          <p>
            He, too, had not neglected to learn that downward slash. As the heir
            to the Tenes family, he couldn’t ignore the one remaining sword
            technique. Yet, he could never replicate such a flawless trajectory.
          </p>
          <p>“That bastard is……”</p>
          <p>
            Of course, Eusus had not properly trained in the downward slash. He
            was the successor to inherit Eldrad, and thus, he had devoted all
            his efforts to mastering the use of magic armor. For him, acquiring
            a surefire strength was a more definite path for the family than
            dedicating himself to the swordsmanship of a family that had already
            fallen into disrepute.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, even with effort, he doubted if he could ever demonstrate
            such prowess.
          </p>
          <p>“He’s a genius…”</p>
          <p>
            Russ, who knew nothing but the downward slash, had nevertheless
            reached a considerable level in other movements as well. He had
            innovated these movements and breathing techniques on his own,
            without any relation to the downward slash. Although they did not
            come close to the power of the downward slash, they were by no means
            trivial. In fact, they were not inferior to the swordsmanship of
            quite a few noble guards.
          </p>
          <p>“To think he could do so much without being taught anything…”</p>
          <p>If a genius is someone who learns ten things when taught one,</p>
          <p>
            What do you call someone who learns ten things without being taught
            even one?
          </p>
          <p>Russ was that kind of person.</p>
          <p>
            Even Eusus, who hated Russ, could not deny that the latter was a
            possessor of talent beyond what the word ‘genius’ could convey.
          </p>
          <p>“… That’s probably why father clings to him all the more.”</p>
          <p>
            The Golden Knight of Graim was looked upon with awe everywhere. As a
            magic swordsman who handled Eldrad, he was confident that he would
            not be inferior in combat against most aura users. He had put in the
            effort, and as much as he had put in, he had received the price of
            strength in return.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, there was an emotion lodged in his heart like a splinter.</p>
          <p>“After all, a magic swordsman is just a magic swordsman.”</p>
          <p>
            While the laymen revered him, the true strong ones never
            acknowledged him. Although they praised him to his face, behind his
            back, they scoffed at him as merely the power of a magical tool.
            Eusus was not unaware of this fact. A shameless knight who parades
            the power of magical tools as his own strength, this was the other
            side of the title held by the illustrious Golden Knight of Graim.
          </p>
          <p>
            And this was also a longstanding concern of the Count of Tenes
            family. To the Count living in such unseen disdain, Russ’s talent
            must have felt like a ray of light. If that was the intention, it
            was not entirely incomprehensible why his father acted the way he
            did.
          </p>
          <p>“But that’s about it.”</p>
          <p>
            Understanding did not mean he agreed. Eusus snorted. He understood
            what was expected, but realistically, Russ was just a mere knight
            who had mastered only one technique.

            ‘No matter how outstanding the talent is, it’s meaningless if the
            circumstances don’t support it. Isn’t the environment also one of
            the talents you possess?’
          </p>
          <p>
            In that sense, it cannot be said that Eusus von Tenes, who is to
            inherit the magical armor Eldrad, is less talented than Russ.
            Realistically, Eusus could take Russ’s life within three seconds. Of
            course, some may argue that’s only if Eldrad is involved, but then
            again, Russ also shows his true abilities only when he has a sword,
            so it’s a case of the pot calling the kettle black.
          </p>
          <p>
            If a swordsman with exceptional skill in wielding a sword is
            recognized as a warrior, then it would be contradictory to say that
            a magic swordsman with exceptional skill in handling magical armor
            is not a warrior. This was Eusus’s thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ugh, this is not the time to be worrying about such trivial
            matters.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus deliberately ignored Russ and tried not to pay any more
            attention to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, there was much to do. He had to organize the relics
            obtained from the ruins and plan to distribute the rewards fairly
            among the members of the knight order. Dealing with the aftermath
            for those who died inside the ruins was also an important issue. He
            was the leader of the Tenes Knight Order. The world wasn’t simple
            enough to just swing a sword around without any thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s not worth my attention. There’s no need to waste my energy on
            such a person.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus turned away from the window. However, his ears still couldn’t
            shake off the song of the wind cutting through the blades.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Deep into the night, a shadow was running through the dense forest
            shrouded in darkness. The man, dressed entirely in black and even
            wearing a mask on his face, was unmistakably suspicious to anyone
            who saw him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaping over the steep mountain ridges as lightly as a mountain
            goat, he easily crossed the forest, which was so dense that even the
            ground beneath his feet wasn’t visible. After running for a while,
            the man paused on a rock to catch his breath and murmured while
            adjusting his mask.
          </p>
          <p>
            “To think I’d be reborn and end up doing all sorts of things,
            including scaling walls with a hood pulled over my head.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The masked man, Repenhardt, chuckled bitterly. He was currently on
            his way to Viscount Kelberen’s castle in the middle of the night.
          </p>
          <p>
            After spending a day in Gehallen Village, Repenhardt and his party
            headed for Kelberen Castle the next morning. The castle, located in
            the direct dominion of Viscount Kelberen, was approximately a day’s
            journey from Gehallen Village. As they entered the village at the
            base of the castle, the sun was already setting into dusk.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finding a suitable inn, Repenhardt immediately started
            gathering information. It was rare for knights from the capital to
            visit such a rural domain, so the innkeeper was quite knowledgeable
            about the activities of the Graim family.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, being informed isn’t exactly about knowing the number of
            enemies or detailed personal information. ‘I heard that a
            distinguished knight has arrived at the Viscount’s castle’, ‘They
            say that this knight and the Viscount went on a grand adventure and
            returned with a mountain of treasures,’ ‘It’s likely that they are
            currently having a splendid party at the Viscount’s castle with
            those knights, or so the rumors went.’; Hardly substantial
            information, but just idle gossip.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, for Repenhardt, that was enough. All he needed to know was
            that the relic, the Voice of Elucion, was still within the walls of
            Kelberen Castle.
          </p>

          <p>
            After a simple dinner, Repenhardt went straight to a clothing store
            to buy black attire. Wearing black was essential for sneaking over
            walls in the dead of night. Not to mention, a thief certainly had no
            business showing his face, so a mask was also necessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, no sane clothing store in the world would sell masks. So,
            he bought some black cloth, cut holes in it, and sewed himself one.
          </p>
          <p>Touching the knot of the mask, Repenhardt suddenly chuckled.</p>
          <p>
            “Come to think of it, this is the first piece of clothing Siris has
            made for me in this life.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Although she posed as a female warrior, a Slayer was, in the end,
            nothing more than a female slave serving men. Naturally, she was
            also taught household skills alongside swordsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, in his previous life, Siris had been skilled in cooking and
            sewing. She would knit scarves or embroider in her spare time,
            making clothes for Repenhardt. Her craftsmanship was excellent,
            producing quite stylish clothing. The knot on the mask was stitched
            meticulously, stitch by stitch, with great skill.
          </p>
          <p>‘Tch, even though it is well made…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt sighed. It was a rather gloomy story that the first piece
            of clothing (if it could be called that) his lover made for him was
            a mask for thievery.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing his preparations, Repenhardt left the inn alone. He
            left Siris and Sillan at the inn. Even though they understood his
            reasons, he wasn’t shameless enough to involve a priest directly in
            thievery. Moreover, while priests could be incredibly helpful in
            combat, they could be a hindrance in situations requiring stealth
            like this.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris was left to guard Sillan. While priests are excellent at
            enhancing others’ combat capabilities, they themselves are not
            combatants. Considering the situation in the Chatan Duchy, it was
            necessary to be prepared for anything.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, even though he had craftily disguised it with lies,
            Repenhardt himself knew best that what he was currently doing
            amounted to theft. No matter how much one harped on about a past
            life, the undeniable truth was that the legitimate owner of the
            Voice of Elucion was the Count of Tenes. Feeling less than
            honorable, he had no inclination to bring Siris along.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, how did things get so tangled up. Tsk.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue as he continued to sprint through the
            forest. Suddenly, he lifted his head to look beyond the branches.
          </p>
          <p>“At last, it’s coming into view.”</p>
          <p>
            Through the branches, the sight of a gray castle, shrouded in
            darkness, emerged. It was Viscount Kelberen’s castle, their
            destination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kelberen’s castle was a three-tiered fortress erected on a cliff
            beside the Yaham River, which flowed from the Setellad Mountains. It
            was designed with towers and an outer castle to prevent enemy
            invasions, an inner castle for slaves and attendants, and at the
            center, a tower and a high castle where the viscount resided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind the castle was a cliff bordered by the river, and the front
            was surrounded by the forest he had passed through. There was only
            one castle gate, built high up on a solitary path with a drawbridge
            in front of it. To attack the castle, it would be impossible to send
            a large force over that narrow path. It was a structure thoroughly
            designed for defense.
          </p>
          <p>As he observed the castle, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>‘Why is a countryside lord’s castle so grand?’</p>

          <p>
            Certainly, Viscount Kelberen’s territory was neither a military
            strategic point nor a trade hub. Of course, there was a need to
            fortify the castle to fend off monsters from the nearby Setellad
            Mountains, but this seemed too much.
          </p>
          <p>
            Wondering, he continued to examine the structure of the castle and
            soon realized the reason.
          </p>
          <p>“This is the craftsmanship of dwarves.”</p>
          <p>
            The construction of this castle was not the work of humans, but of
            dwarves. This could be clearly seen from the structure of the walls
            and the placement of the towers. Employing dwarf slaves could build
            a far superior building at a much lower cost than using humans, so
            it made sense for a countryside lord’s castle to be so magnificent.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘The Viscount of Kelberen has established his position through
            mining…’
          </p>
          <p>
            In the current era, employing dwarf slaves for mining was a matter
            of common sense. Dwarves, being naturally resistant to dust―indeed,
            unaffected by it―and possessing superior strength and stamina, as
            well as an instinctive ability to read the veins of rocks, were
            considered a race specially adapted for mining and construction.
          </p>
          <p>
            If open-pit mining were straightforward, human miners could be
            employed, but when it comes to digging into the earth, the
            productivity of dwarves simply cannot be matched. For such reasons,
            the household of Viscount Kelberen also possessed a considerable
            number of dwarf slaves, who were fully utilized in the construction
            of this castle.
          </p>
          <p>‘Regardless, infiltrating won’t be easy.’</p>
          <p>
            Hiding in the shadow of the bushes, Repenhardt continuously scanned
            his surroundings. Two human soldiers stood guard in front of the
            castle gate, and three more patrolled along the top of the walls,
            with fires lit at various points to maximize visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a stern guard reminiscent of wartime preparations, evidently
            due to the valuable relics of the Silver Age that they possessed,
            warranting such heightened security measures.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, it’s all within expectations.’</p>
          <p>
            With a slight smile, Repenhardt sensed the presences around him with
            his aura. As the soldiers on the wall crossed paths, he darted out
            from the shadow of the bushes and across the open ground beneath the
            walls.
          </p>
          <p>Tap, tap, tap!</p>
          <p>
            In just three steps, Repenhardt reached the dark shadow beneath the
            watchtower without anyone noticing, even as a well-built man passed
            through a lit area.
          </p>
          <p>
            Logically, the presence of a guard and the approach of a patrol
            should have heightened the alertness, not diminished it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But there was a flaw. No matter how vigilantly one might guard a
            position, being human means one’s attention can be diverted. Even
            knowing the approaching figure to be an ally, attention can shift
            momentarily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt exploited this brief lapse in attention. The formidable
            sensory capabilities of an aura wielder go beyond merely detecting
            presence; they can also sense the mental state of others to some
            extent. This is typically used to detect an opponent’s movements,
            but he noticed the moment the guards’ attention wavered and took
            action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naturally, not being a professional thief, Repenhardt made some
            noise. One of the guards, who had been exchanging nighttime
            pleasantries with a patrolman, looked down below the walls, puzzled.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? What’s that?”</p>

          <p>
            But by then, Repenhardt had already hidden himself in the shadows.
            The guard, tilting his head in confusion, turned back to return to
            his post.
          </p>
          <p>Whish!</p>
          <p>
            With the sound of the wind, a dark shadow soared up towards the top
            of the wall.
          </p>
          <p>“… Huh? Ack!”</p>
          <p>
            Before the guard could even register surprise, a powerful impact
            struck the nape of his neck, and he collapsed. As the patrolmen on
            the wall were thrown into confusion by the sudden appearance of the
            intruder and were about to sound the alarm, a voice apologized.
          </p>
          <p>“Sorry!”</p>
          <p>
            With the apology, Repenhardt threw punches left and right. Golden
            aura blasts struck three patrolmen and the remaining guard, knocking
            them all unconscious in an instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            After dealing with the guards, Repenhardt quickly crouched down and
            surveyed his surroundings.
          </p>
          <p>‘Has anyone seen me?’</p>
          <p>
            His fists were literally weapons. It was more effective to use
            energy projectiles with reduced power for non-lethal purposes than
            to punch carelessly. However, the bright flashes of the projectiles
            made them unsuitable for stealthy operations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt did not act without thought, however. Viscount Kelberen’s
            castle walls were fiercely guarded, with bonfires blazing every ten
            meters. He figured the light from the projectiles would not stand
            out too much in this brightness.
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately, it seemed he had not been noticed.</p>
          <p>‘Beginner’s luck, perhaps.’</p>
          <p>Repenhardt sighed in relief and moved quickly.</p>
          <p>
            He planted the guards’ spears into the ground and propped the
            unconscious men against them like scarecrows, making it appear from
            a distance as if they were still standing guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            After securing the area, he surveyed the inside of the outer castle.
            The bonfires lit up the area well, but no signs of life were
            evident.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, given the time, everyone must be in bed.’</p>
          <p>
            He had to hurry. No matter how well he arranged the guards to appear
            normal, it was only a temporary measure; a closer inspection would
            reveal the ruse. Taking a deep breath, he reminded himself of the
            plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though Repenhardt possessed a superhuman body awakened with
            aura, he had no illusions about sneaking into a noble’s castle,
            stealing items, and escaping unnoticed like a legendary phantom
            thief.
          </p>
          <p>
            Honestly, he couldn’t fathom how one could accomplish such feats.
            Had he regained his magic from a previous life, perhaps he could
            have cast a wide-ranging sleep spell over everyone in the castle and
            casually taken what he wanted.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘But that would be more akin to the act of a bold bandit rather than
            a thief.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, the only option available to him was clear. Since there
            was no way to avoid detection, the best strategy was to complete his
            mission before getting caught.
          </p>
          <p>‘Quick and decisive. Grab and go.’</p>
          <p>
            With a swish of his cloak, Repenhardt leapt down from the castle
            wall.

            [ Chapter 53 ]<br />
            In the corridors of the castle, where only the faint moonlight
            seeped through the windows into the darkness, two soldiers carrying
            lanterns were on patrol. Both were natives of Viscount Kelberen’s
            domain, ordinarily making their living through hunting and
            blacksmithing.
          </p>
          <p>
            A middle-aged soldier, originally a hunter, stopped mid-stride and
            clicked his tongue, remarking,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Our lord does worry quite a bit. With the Golden Knight of Graim
            around, who would dare to invade us that he felt the need to summon
            us too?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Viscount Kelberen, tasked with guarding valuable relics, had drafted
            those within his domain known for their strength to patrol inside
            the castle. Of course, the relics were strictly guarded by the Tenes
            Knights, but the Viscount, being the host, could not show any less
            courtesy. Naturally, the common folk were unaware of such
            circumstances, likely viewing it as unnecessary worry.
          </p>
          <p>The other soldier shrugged.</p>
          <p>“So what? It’s good for us, gets us some extra drink money.”</p>
          <p>
            Drafted they may be, neither soldier held any complaints. Viscount
            Kelberen was a generous lord. Staying up all night meant a tidy
            extra income, so they had no reason to object.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, it wasn’t as if there was an ongoing siege, nor was there
            any intelligence suggesting an imminent invasion. In their view,
            this heightened state of alert was merely overcaution on the part of
            Viscount Kelberen. There was no life-threatening danger, so they
            felt no tension.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, both soldiers were essentially touring the lord’s castle with
            a sense of excitement, their patrol more a leisurely stroll than
            anything serious.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, the knights of the capital are on a different level
            altogether.”
          </p>
          <p>“Right? Even their armor shines differently.”</p>
          <p>
            “Our lord is a knight too, but the grandeur is just different, hmm.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, watch what you’re saying.”</p>
          <p>
            Amidst their casual chatter as they walked down the corridor, one of
            the soldiers suddenly looked back, puzzled.
          </p>
          <p>“Hm?”</p>
          <p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
          <p>“Ah, nothing. Was it just my imagination?”</p>
          <p>
            Scratching his head, the soldier continued walking forward. For a
            moment, it felt as though someone was behind them, but upon looking
            back, there was no one.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, I’m hardly a legendary warrior to sense such presences.’</p>
          <p>
            Dismissing the thought, the two soldiers resumed their conversation,
            walking towards the other end of the corridor. And as they turned a
            corner and disappeared, someone silently dropped from the dark
            ceiling. It was Repenhardt, wearing a mask.
          </p>
          <p>‘Heh, this is turning out to be much easier than I thought.’</p>

          <p>
            Feeling the presence fade away, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.
            Having infiltrated the castle, he was walking down a hallway when he
            sensed someone approaching and immediately leapt up to cling to the
            ceiling. It would have been utterly foolish to do this during the
            day, but at night, the story was different. Those walking with
            lanterns unconsciously directed their gaze towards the ground. It
            was unusual for anyone to shine their light towards the ceiling.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It’s not for no reason that the thieves in stories often cling to
            ceilings like lizards.’
          </p>
          <p>
            There was a basis for such behavior. Of course, sticking to ceilings
            wasn’t something just anyone could do with their physical
            abilities—it was likely only possible for exceptionally skilled
            thieves.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘With this foolishly strong body, I could hang here all day if
            needed.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, being called a superhuman wasn’t for naught as an Aura user.
            His extraordinary physical abilities and sensational perception made
            it not so difficult for Repenhardt, even as a novice in thievery, to
            infiltrate this far. Having the ability to detect everyone’s
            position solved the biggest problem of sneaking in.
          </p>
          <p>‘Thievery is nothing special.’</p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt’s biggest enemy at the moment wasn’t the lax
            guards but time itself. He hurriedly moved on.
          </p>
          <p>
            His destination was the tower on the southern side of the castle.
            Places where relics were gathered inevitably leaked magic due to
            their nature. It wasn’t too difficult for a mage of high caliber to
            locate them. Although Repenhardt’s magic and computational abilities
            were lacking, his understanding, enlightenment, and detection skills
            in magic were still of a grand mage level. As soon as he infiltrated
            the castle, he was able to locate where the relics were stored.
          </p>
          <p>
            Crossing the hallway and occasionally going out through the windows
            to climb the outer walls like a lizard, Repenhardt quickly reached
            the base of the tower. It took him less than 10 minutes to get here,
            a feat that would be impossible for even the most skilled thieves.
          </p>
          <p>‘Maybe, I actually had a knack for being a phantom thief.’</p>
          <p>
            In reality, it was just that an Aura user possessed overwhelmingly
            powerful abilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, Repenhardt carefully examined the tower. There was no sign
            of life inside, but two knights were standing guard at the entrance.
            They were fully equipped with chain mail armor, swords, and shields,
            looking significantly more formidable than any soldiers he had
            encountered so far.
          </p>
          <p>‘Those must be the knights of Tenes.’</p>
          <p>
            Seizing the cover of darkness, Repenhardt launched himself forward.
            Suddenly, a massive black shadow soared in front of the knights, who
            cried out in alarm.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>“What is that!”</p>
          <p>
            True to their training, the knights reacted differently. Unlike the
            outer city guards who had been dazed, they immediately heightened
            their alertness and assumed defensive positions.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the outcome wasn’t much different. Repenhardt swiftly moved
            between two knights and flicked the left knight’s throat with his
            finger to prevent him from screaming. Fearing a strike could sever
            the neck, he chose to flick it with his finger, which seemed to be
            the right decision as the knight grasped his throat, gasping and
            emitting a dying groan.
          </p>
          <p>“Gah, Gah!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Repenhardt moved behind the opposite knight and
            choked him. It happened almost simultaneously, leaving the victim no
            chance to cry out. Just lightly pressing on the carotid artery with
            his thick forearm for about ten seconds was enough to make the
            knight’s body slump. Soon after, the other knight, barely having
            regained his breath, was also put into a chokehold and passed out.
            Both were well-trained knights but, being human, they couldn’t avoid
            passing out if blood flow to the brain was cut off.
          </p>
          <p>Having quickly subdued both knights, Repenhardt smirked.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Submission holds are indeed the best for silencing without noise.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, there’s nothing like joint locks for efficiently subduing
            an opponent without harm. No matter how good one is at controlling
            strength, striking techniques inherently carry the risk of killing
            due to individual resilience. However, joint locks significantly
            reduce that burden.
          </p>

          <p>
            Carefully seating the knights nearby, Repenhardt tied their arms and
            gagged them as a precaution, considering that their trained nature
            meant they could awaken shortly.
          </p>
          <p>
            He then inspected the tower. Faint magical power was detectable from
            the door.
          </p>
          <p>‘Motion detection wards and heat sensing magic, perhaps.’</p>
          <p>
            All magic has its unique formulas and patterns of magical power. Of
            course, to accurately identify them, one usually needs to use
            detection magic, but with Repenhardt’s expertise, he could get a
            rough idea of low-level wards just from the faint magical power
            sensed.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s annoying not being able to disarm it.’</p>
          <p>
            However, that didn’t mean he was without options. Repenhardt
            carefully examined the area around the door.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Given the nature of magical wards, the core must be somewhere
            around here.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Unless a wizard who had set up a barrier was not residing within the
            tower, it was unlikely for the core of the barrier to be located
            inside the door. Since setting the barrier from outside would allow
            the caster to comfortably retire to their own bed, Repenhardt
            concentrated his mind, keenly sensing the flow of magical energy.
          </p>
          <p>After a moment, he smiled triumphantly.</p>
          <p>“Found it.”</p>
          <p>
            The core of the barrier appeared to be an ordinary-looking stone
            placed near the door. However, invisible to the eye, it surely had
            runes engraved on its inside. Repenhardt focused his strength for a
            moment and struck the stone. Simply moving the core would alter the
            barrier, triggering an alarm spell, but shattering the core in one
            go would naturally release it.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a soft noise, the stone broke, and the barrier on the door
            dissolved. Repenhardt cautiously entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The security seemed to rely solely on the door’s barrier, as no
            further patterns of magical energy were felt. What remained were
            relics alone. Inside the vast tower, relics from the Silver Age were
            neatly organized, each placed according to its category.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt wore a nostalgic expression for a moment.</p>
          <p>
            “The Anti-Magic Tome, the Sealing Jar, the Infinite Bag, and the
            Harp of the Sky. I miss them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            All were relics he had personally unearthed in his previous life.
            Seeing the tags left by the magicians on each relic brought back
            even more memories. Moreover, he noticed some were incorrectly
            categorized.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Who assessed these? This isn’t the Helteon Blade but the Tallad
            Sword. They might look similar, but the formulas are completely
            different. To categorize them like this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He considered correcting them but decided against it. There was no
            time for that now. He quickly surveyed the relics, weaving through
            the shelves. Suddenly, Repenhardt’s eyes sparkled. His gaze settled
            on a square black box placed at the bottom of a shelf designated for
            uncategorized relics.
          </p>
          <p>“There it is! The Voice of Elucion!”</p>
          <p>
            Elated, Repenhardt picked up the box. He had been quite worried, but
            it turned out to be easier than expected. A smile naturally came to
            his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, even if he was a novice as a thief, possessing the
            physical abilities of an aura user along with the knowledge of a
            great mage made it natural for him to bypass even the most stringent
            security systems!
          </p>
          <p>
            Triumphantly, Repenhardt placed the box in his pocket. Just as he
            was about to leave,
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, a loud bell started ringing!</p>

          <p>Ding-dong-ding-dong!</p>
          <p>“Eh?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt looked around in confusion.</p>
          <p>
            “What’s going on? There was definitely no sound, and I’m sure I
            avoided the magical barriers.”
          </p>
          <p>
            His eyes, bewildered, inadvertently caught sight of his feet. His
            expensive deer leather boots were stepping on a thread so thin it
            was barely visible.
          </p>
          <p>
            He shifted his gaze along the thread to the side. ‘What do we have
            here?’ At the end of the thread, a crude brass bell was
            conspicuously hanging.
          </p>
          <p>At that moment, Repenhardt let out a groan.</p>
          <p>“Ugh? Just a simple thread trap?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>At the second floor of Kelberen Castle, in the lord’s bedroom.</p>
          <p>
            Viscount Kelberen was deeply asleep, feeling quite pleasant. Despite
            a slightly unpleasant incident during dinner, Sir Eusus was indeed a
            knight among knights. He had covered for his rudeness and had
            treated his daughters with all due respect.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the battle with that demon was spectacular. As a knight,
            witnessing such an incredible fight made the burning of the garden
            seem insignificant. In fact, he was planning to leave the ruins as
            they were. The remnants of a hero’s battle would serve as an
            exemplary knightly legacy for future generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            For such reasons, Viscount Kelberen and his wife were enjoying a
            rare deep sleep. What shattered this small piece of happiness was a
            sudden noise from outside the window.
          </p>
          <p>Clang, clang, clang, clang!</p>
          <p>
            The sudden loud sound of metal woke him up. It was a familiar
            sound—the sound of an alarm spell being triggered. Currently, the
            alarm spell was set up in only one location. Realizing this, the old
            man’s sleepiness vanished instantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            He hastily got out of bed and looked out the window. However, the
            window in his room faced the forest, making it impossible to
            understand the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            His wife, sleeping beside him, asked with a panicked expression.
          </p>
          <p>“Dear, what’s happening?”</p>
          <p>“We’ll find out soon!”</p>
          <p>
            Reassuring his wife, Viscount Kelberen shouted towards the outside.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey! What on earth is going on?”</p>
          <p>
            The sound of hurried footsteps approached, and soon an answer came.
            His faithful butler was shouting from outside the door.
          </p>
          <p>“There’s an intruder in the south tower!”</p>
          <p>The old man’s wrinkled face twisted in frustration.</p>
          <p>“What a disgraceful event!”</p>
          <p>
            He lamented. This was his castle. Sir Eusus had trusted him and was
            staying in this castle. To allow the presence of an intruder here!
            It was an indelible disgrace as a knight and as the lord of a
            castle.
          </p>
          <p>Viscount Kelberen bellowed.</p>

          <p>
            [ Chapter 54 ]<br />
            A middle-aged man with a rugged appearance lunged forward, wielding
            a scale spear.
          </p>
          <p>“Ughhh!”</p>
          <p>
            With a cry too embarrassing to be called a battle shout, the spear
            flailed through the air. Tilting his head to dodge lightly,
            Repenhardt effortlessly grabbed the scale spear. The middle-aged man
            exerted force in both hands, trying not to lose his weapon, but
            Repenhardt simply lifted both the spear and the man with one hand.
          </p>
          <p>“Ughegh!”</p>
          <p>
            Lifted bodily into the air, the middle-aged man screamed a strange
            shriek. It was reminiscent of the mandrake, a herb used by magicians
            that screams when uprooted. Repenhardt tossed the man aside and
            sighed.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, this is maddening.”</p>
          <p>
            The activation of a string trap rang a bell, which in turn triggered
            an alarm spell connected to it, causing the alarm sound to
            reverberate throughout the castle. Those who were sleeping woke up,
            and everyone started heading towards where Repenhardt was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the opponents were alerted, it was impossible to avoid their
            gaze by merely sticking to the ceiling. The only option left was to
            knock down those who were in the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah, why did I have to fall for such a foolish trap after overcoming
            all the difficult ones…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt bitterly regretted his complacency. If he had even a
            little experience in thievery, he might have avoided such a simple
            trap. No matter how powerful a mage or aura user he was, he wasn’t a
            professional thief. Having abilities but lacking knowledge was a
            predictable outcome.
          </p>
          <p>‘Indeed, thievery is a job for thieves.’</p>
          <p>
            Dealing with the soldiers swarming towards him, Repenhardt crossed
            the courtyard of the inner keep. Most of the soldiers now gathering
            were civilians drafted by Viscount Kelberen from his domain, mainly
            tasked with guarding. Although they were somewhat strong, they were
            not properly trained in martial arts and stood no chance against
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>However, this was more troublesome for him.</p>
          <p>‘If I hit them carelessly, they might die…’</p>
          <p>
            Since punching them would surely kill, he was swinging an awkwardly
            grabbed spear handle in reverse, striking down the approaching
            soldiers. But even this was causing them to scream in pain, breaking
            bones here and there, making Repenhardt worry about potentially
            crippling someone.
          </p>
          <p>
            These were truly innocent people. Moreover, they weren’t those who
            had staked their lives on the sword, so taking their lives, whether
            as a magician or a warrior, was something his conscience could not
            allow.
          </p>
          <p>“Catch the thief!”</p>
          <p>“Grab him!”</p>
          <p>“Woahhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Viscount Kelberen seemed to be well-respected, as his comrades
            continued to rush at Repenhardt in a rage, despite falling one by
            one, rather than fleeing. Carefully, paying attention to every swing
            of the club, Repenhardt continued to retreat towards the outer wall.
            After all, he had already obtained the voice of Elucion he wanted,
            so he had no more business there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, a group of soldiers appeared from the direction of the outer
            wall. They were knights, properly armored and armed. It was the
            standby force of the Tenes Knight Order, who had been guarding the
            outer city, now mobilized.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the ordinary soldiers, they quickly formed a surrounding net
            and encircled Repenhardt. The formation was so tight that Repenhardt
            couldn’t find an escape route for a moment. As he hesitated, a
            middle-aged knight from the knight order appeared. It was Sir Lot,
            the deputy commander of the knights.
          </p>

          <p>“Halt, you villain!”</p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot yelled with a deep voice, pointing his sword at Repenhardt,
            who twisted his lips.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No, I mean, I sneaked in without killing anyone, trying to be
            somewhat humane, and I’m called a villain!’
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, a thief will have his excuses, but he’s still a thief. There’s
            no point in feeling unjust about being unmasked.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smirking bitterly, Repenhardt surveyed the encirclement. Knights
            were at the forefront, and behind them were ten mages and six
            priests. Their quick coordination suggested they were part of the
            Elucion ruins exploration team.
          </p>
          <p>Though momentarily taken aback, he soon regained his composure.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Eh, I hadn’t considered such a situation? There’s no need to panic.
            Since it has come to this, although it’s regrettable, the best
            option is to knock them all down and flee before the Golden Knight
            arrives!’
          </p>
          <p>“Haah!”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Repenhardt let out a loud cry. More of a roar than a cry,
            it momentarily made the knights flinch. At that moment, he kicked
            off the ground and dashed towards one side of the encirclement.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh no!”</p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot exclaimed in surprise. Repenhardt was already delivering
            consecutive side kicks towards two knights constructing the
            encirclement. Both knights managed to defend with their shields but
            were sent flying through the air as if hit by a siege ram. The force
            was monstrous. Alarmed, Sir Lot shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Maintain positions! Mages, form a circle!”</p>
          <p>
            The mages had already begun chanting. They conjured lightning,
            flames, and icy arrows, shooting them towards Repenhardt, who
            frowned at the barrage of various magics before glaring at a knight
            beside him.
          </p>
          <p>“Really, really sorry about this!”</p>
          <p>“Eh? What for?”</p>
          <p>
            The knight was taken aback for a moment. What exactly was there to
            be sorry about? However, he soon realized the answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as Repenhardt finished speaking, he suddenly approached the
            knight, grabbed him by the back of the neck, and lifted him up. It
            was a technique from the tradition of Gym Unbreakable, known as the
            ‘mother cat carrying her kitten style’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having lifted the knight, Repenhardt then thrust him towards the
            incoming magic. The knight, clad in armor, was used as a shield.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            The knight screamed as he was hit squarely by lightning, scorching
            heat, and ice arrows. However, the magic dissipated upon touching
            his armor, activated by the anti-magic blessings the clerics had
            bestowed upon him to counteract the mages’ spells.
          </p>
          <p>Sir Lot shouted in anger.</p>
          <p>
            “Using a person as a shield, what kind of atrocious act is this!”
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, I did know about the blessing on the armor.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt made excuses internally, but that didn’t change the fact
            that he had used a living person as a shield. The knights, filled
            with rage, charged at him. Repenhardt retreated repeatedly under the
            attacks of knights who thrust their swords with shields in front.
          </p>

          <p>Sir Lot shouted again.</p>
          <p>“Fire the arrows!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was unconcerned about the arrows, knowing they wouldn’t
            affect him. But when he was hit by one, he realized these were no
            ordinary arrows.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh! What is this?”</p>
          <p>
            The arrowheads were attached to chains, and the tips were coated
            with a sticky liquid. It was the sap of the Kali tree, known for its
            strong adhesive properties, applied to the arrowheads and connected
            to chains. The Tenes Knights had such weapons in their arsenal,
            knowing that many powerful demons from ancient ruins were impervious
            to mere spears and swords.
          </p>
          <p>
            Dozens of chain arrows hit Repenhardt, the sticky liquid securing
            the arrows in place, and knights pulling on the chains attached to
            them. Suddenly, Repenhardt’s movements were restricted.
          </p>
          <p>Flames appeared in his eyes.</p>
          <p>“Hmph! This is nothing!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt swung his arms violently, intending to swing around the
            knights holding the chains. However, it seemed the knights had
            anticipated this as well. They had already released the chains and
            were charging towards Repenhardt. The purpose of the chain arrows
            was not to bind him, but to momentarily restrict his movement.
          </p>
          <p>
            The knights approached again, shields in front. Repenhardt attacked
            over the shields, but this time, he couldn’t send them flying back
            as before. The clerics’ blessings had significantly enhanced their
            physical abilities.
          </p>
          <p>“Sir Gahar! Forward!”</p>
          <p>“Jod! Provide support!”</p>
          <p>
            Under the command of Sir Lot, the knights had established a
            surrounding network and were attacking in turns. Chains and arrows
            flew between them, attempts were made to bind arms and legs with
            iron chains, and occasionally, large nets were thrown. Of course,
            Repenhardt destroyed and tore everything apart with his unique
            monstrous strength, but this only served to gradually exhaust his
            well-trained body.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt broke out in a cold sweat.</p>
          <p>“These guys are not to be underestimated, are they?”</p>
          <p>
            These knights differed in style from those of the Altion Marquis
            Family they had encountered at the Falton Ruins. The capability of
            the knights, whether from the Altion or the Tenes Knights, was not
            much different. However, these were followers of the magic knight,
            Eusus. Therefore, they were less hesitant to rely on the power of
            tools. They did not possess precious magic weapons, but they freely
            used nets and binding chains, which are normally used by hunters.
          </p>
          <p>
            If it had been someone else’s concern, he might have praised it as a
            flexible and excellent attitude. But when it happened to himself, it
            naturally made him grit his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it! To think knights would resort to this!”</p>
          <p>
            Thus, Repenhardt continued to battle against the Tenes Knights.
            Despite being tactically superior, Repenhardt, an aura user, could
            not deliver a decisive blow to the Tenes Knights. All they could do
            was maintain the siege and drag out the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, this was also a typical tactic of the Tenes Knights. When
            facing powerful demons in ruins, they would drag out the time while
            minimizing casualties, waiting to give Eusus a chance for a fatal
            blow. Now, they were treating Repenhardt as if he were some demon of
            the ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Facing opponents skilled in dragging out time, Repenhardt found it
            difficult to find the right moment to escape. It was then, when he
            was growing anxious.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, from one side of the siege, a young knight threw away his
            shield and charged with only his sword in hand.
          </p>
          <p>“This evil fiend! Face the sword of Tenes!”</p>

          <p>“Huh? What’s with this idiot?”</p>
          <p>
            Breaking through the perfect siege to charge in? Even Repenhardt was
            taken aback by such foolishness. But nonetheless, it was a welcome
            situation for him. He quickly charged towards the young knight.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was then. Repenhardt’s expression changed strangely when he saw
            the face of the young knight.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? This guy looks familiar, but who is he?”</p>
          <p>
            He felt an odd sense of familiarity, but couldn’t pinpoint who it
            was. From a distance, the frustrated shout of Sir Lot was heard.
          </p>
          <p>“Russ! Maintain the formation!”</p>
          <p>
            It was a name he had never heard before. Was it just his
            imagination? He pondered briefly in that moment. The young knight,
            Russ, targeted him and slashed down with his sword.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            In an instant, Repenhardt’s expression hardened from the casual
            thought he had before.
          </p>
          <p>“Gasp!”</p>
          <p>
            The knight had seemed ordinary in movement, breathing, and stepping.
            But that single slash was far from ordinary. Compared to the aura
            user Lantas, this movement was in no way inferior!
          </p>
          <p>Flash!</p>
          <p>
            The sword light cut through the air with the momentum to split the
            world itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The description might sound impressive, but ultimately, it means the
            attack missed. If it had hit properly, it would have split
            Repenhardt, not just the air.
          </p>
          <p>
            With a simple twist of his body, Repenhardt easily dodged the attack
            and immediately landed a middle kick to Russ’s side. Of course,
            Repenhardt had launched this strike as a feint. Given the previous
            sword strike, he hadn’t expected such a simple attack to hit. But
            then…
          </p>
          <p>“Keugh!”</p>
          <p>
            The attack landed squarely. Repenhardt’s mouth fell open in surprise
            at the sight of Russ spitting blood and flying away.
          </p>
          <p>“What the, this guy?”</p>
          <p>
            The slash had been perfect. Thus, Repenhardt had faced him with a
            sense of wariness. However, it seemed that the subsequent actions
            were once again unremarkable.
          </p>
          <p>“Truly an unbalanced fellow.”</p>
          <p>
            Thanks to this, he managed to escape the encirclement. Repenhardt’s
            face brightened as he ran towards the city walls. He couldn’t miss
            this chance.
          </p>
          <p>“Now, for the escape!”</p>
          <p>Just as he was about to leap over the wall…</p>
          <p>“The Blade of the Sky, tear through the void!”</p>
          <p>
            With a booming shout, a powerful blade of wind flew towards him and
            struck him directly. While the attack was not strong enough to
            injure Repenhardt, it was sufficient to break his momentum as he was
            about to rise. Struck in midair, he had no way to exert force. He
            fell back inside the walls, managed to land on his feet, and gritted
            his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>
            He knew who had launched the magic without needing to see. The sense
            of an aura user was more accurate than sight in identifying an
            opponent.
          </p>
          <p>“The Golden Knight of Graim…”</p>
          <p>
            A knight clad in armor shining with golden light, Eusus von Tenes,
            stood in front of him, wearing the magical armor Eldrad.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div
          id="chr-content"
          class="chr-c"
          style="
            font-family: Arial, sans-serif, serif;
            font-size: 18px;

            margin-top: 15px;
          "
        >
          <div></div>

          <p>
            [ Chapter 55 ]<br />
            Holding his sword at the ready, Eusus glanced sideways to assess the
            situation inside the fortress.
          </p>
          <p>
            It looked as if a typhoon had swept through, with the visible ruins
            and the groaning soldiers of the Viscount Kelberen’s forces
            scattered around. The condition of the Tenes Knights wasn’t much
            better. Among the half-destroyed encirclement, he could see his
            precious subordinates bleeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            Admiration for the opponent’s martial prowess involuntarily arose in
            him.
          </p>
          <p>“… At this point, it’s hard to blame the viscount’s guards.”</p>
          <p>
            The sight of scattered chain arrows and torn metal nets made the
            situation clear. The Tenes Knights had surely arranged their
            formation properly and exerted their full strength against the
            intruders. Yet, they were overwhelmed. Naturally, the viscount’s
            soldiers, who were ordinary men on any other day, stood no chance.
          </p>
          <p>“Who exactly is it?”</p>
          <p>
            Amidst his suspicion, Eusus looked straight ahead. A man in black
            robes and a black mask silently glared at him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man had a robust build. Although Eusus was not one to be outdone
            in stature anywhere he went, compared to this man, he seemed a
            couple of fists smaller. Moreover, it wasn’t just about the size.
            The man’s body seemed remarkably well-trained, evident even through
            his clothes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such skill indicated that the man could not be nameless. Either he
            himself held considerable fame, or he was definitely the descendant
            of someone significantly renowned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pointing his sword, Eusus spoke, “Your skills are too excessive for
            just hopping over someone’s wall in the middle of the night.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt replied with a bitter voice, “Ah, there’s a bit of a
            situation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s expression hardened even more. The voice was quite young. At
            most, not older than himself. Could someone of such a young age
            possess this level of skill?
          </p>
          <p>
            His wariness towards the identity of his opponent only intensified.
            Clutching his sword Eldran more firmly, Eusus muttered coldly.
          </p>
          <p>“That situation, I’ll have to hear it out later.”</p>
          <p>
            Yes, later. After binding him tightly with thick chains and locking
            him up in a strict prison.
          </p>
          <p>
            An invisible fighting spirit slowly rose behind Repenhardt as well.
          </p>
          <p>“Sorry, but let’s postpone our chat a bit longer.”</p>
          <p>
            The gazes of the two intersected in the air, intertwining their
            fighting spirits and emitting a powerful aura. In the silent
            tension, as if a violent explosion was imminent, a sinister heat
            rose like a mirage. Everyone held their breath and watched this
            moment.
          </p>
          <p>“Clash!”</p>
          <p>“Ha!”</p>
          <p>
            Without a clear initiator, both men simultaneously kicked off the
            ground and collided in midair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gym Unbreakable’s teachings were all about taking the initiative to
            win; if something seemed even remotely uncertain, his master’s
            advice was to charge in first. In Repenhardt’s view, Eusus von
            Tenes’s abilities were ambiguous enough to warrant such an approach,
            so naturally, he lunged forward first.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, the issue was that the von Tenes family also deeply
            believed in the principle of seizing the initiative.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as he launched his attack, the opponent rushed in too, leaving
            both Eusus and Repenhardt momentarily taken aback. A slash and a
            straight punch flew towards each other’s vital spots in what was a
            blatantly reckless attack, essentially a ‘kill or be killed’
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>“Eugh!”</p>
          <p>“Damn it!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt hastily twisted his body in midair, pulling back his
            punch while dodging the slash. Eusus, equally surprised, withdrew
            his sword and moved out of the punch’s trajectory. It was as if they
            had synchronized their actions.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a spectator’s perspective, the scene turned somewhat comedic.
            They had charged at each other as if to kill, only to suddenly dodge
            and retreat at the last moment—both of them, simultaneously!
          </p>
          <p>“…What is Eusus doing?”</p>
          <p>“…And why is that thief acting like that?”</p>
          <p>
            With his sword withdrawn, Eusus created some distance between them.
            The murmuring of his subordinates from behind made his face burn
            with embarrassment. The opponent seemed to feel the same way; the
            eyes visible through the mask showed evident embarrassment.
          </p>
          <p>Both let out a snicker towards each other.</p>
          <p>“It’s gotten complicated.”</p>
          <p>“It has indeed.”</p>
          <p>
            This was certainly not the time for a friendly sparring session,
            exchanging warm gazes. Eusus hardened his expression again and
            focused, shouting out.
          </p>
          <p>“I become the shadow of the abyss and roar!”</p>
          <p>
            From beneath Eusus’s feet, a black shadow rose, turning into three
            blade-like projections that lunged at Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>‘Howling Shadow, huh.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, recognizing the magic instantly, took a step back to
            create distance, then spun around. Ignoring the shadow blades, he
            attempted a surface kick, which instead swept the ground in front of
            him, stirring up a mound of dirt and deeply gouging the earth. The
            soldiers of the Viscount’s family were momentarily puzzled.
          </p>
          <p>‘What is he doing, digging the ground all of a sudden?’</p>
          <p>
            Just then, the flying black shadow got caught in the disturbed
            ground and flew off in an unexpected direction. Eusus frowned.
          </p>
          <p>‘How did he know the weakness of Howling Shadow?’</p>
          <p>
            The magical shadow blades had merged with the new darkness created
            by Repenhardt, deviating from their intended target. Executing that
            in the blink of an eye? Apart from martial skills, this would be
            impossible without substantial knowledge of magic.
          </p>
          <p>Eusus exclaimed in admiration as he swung his sword down.</p>
          <p>“You’re quite adept at dealing with magic!”</p>

          <p>
            Dodging the strike with steps to the left and right, Repenhardt
            replied nonchalantly.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, it’s pretty much common knowledge.”</p>
          <p>
            Continuously evading, he immediately counterattacked with a kick.
            The counterattack came at such a perfect moment that there was no
            way to avoid it. In desperation, Eusus crouched to take the kick,
            trusting in the defensive power of his armor, Eldrad. The opponent’s
            middle kick struck hard on the torso armor of Eusus.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            A groan escaped. It felt as though the shock was piercing through
            his entire body. His insides churned, feeling as though something
            was about to burst out from his stomach. Despite bracing himself for
            the impact, the shock was no joke.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘To think it would have such destructive power even though I took it
            on the armor!’
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, thanks to that, he didn’t lose his balance. Swinging his
            sword horizontally, Eusus slashed at Repenhardt’s waist and shouted
            in succession.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Wind, become an arrow! Heatwave, coalesce and strike the enemy!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aero Blast and Fire Ball materialized and flew towards Repenhardt
            from both sides. Repenhardt deflected the Aero Blast with his arm
            and struck down the Fire Ball with his sword, blocking all incoming
            magic. Seizing the moment, Eusus lunged forward.
          </p>
          <p>“Awaken, Eldran!”</p>
          <p>
            Utilizing the momentum of his leap, Eusus charged his sword and
            struck down directly on Repenhardt’s crown. The moment Repenhardt
            sensed the oscillating magical patterns on the surging golden blade,
            he was horrified.
          </p>
          <p>‘Material Destroy? Such high-level magic can be activated?’</p>
          <p>
            Eldrad being one of the strongest relics from the Silver Age wasn’t
            an exaggeration after all! He turned pale and leaped backward. No
            matter how much his body was tempered like steel, this worst
            destructive spell that disperses material bonds could turn even
            steel into sand. Defending against it would mean a direct journey to
            the afterlife!
          </p>
          <p>Swoosh!</p>
          <p>
            The blade narrowly missed Repenhardt’s chest and sliced through the
            air. The magic imbued in the sword struck the ground, causing an
            explosive sound to resonate.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            Through the swirling sands, the figure of his opponent was blurred
            and barely visible. Eusus von Tenes clicked his tongue as he
            readjusted his stance. The evasion he had just witnessed was so fast
            that it was almost invisible to the naked eye. For Eusus, who had
            enhanced his dynamic vision to superhuman levels through magic, to
            miss such speed, there could only be one explanation.
          </p>
          <p>‘… An Aura wielder?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, having retreated, burst forward again with a speed
            reminiscent of a shot arrow, closing the distance in an instant.
            Eusus, recognizing the urgency, quickly cast a spell.
          </p>
          <p>“Breath of Corrosion, flow through the void!”</p>
          <p>
            A mist rose up like that of a rugged landscape, enveloping
            Repenhardt. The spell was a setup for a strike with a reinforced
            blade, aiming for a weak point, but Repenhardt suddenly leapt,
            spinning and kicking through the air repeatedly with such ferocity
            that the sheer wind pressure dispersed the mist in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>

          <p>
            Breaking through the ‘Mist of Acid,’ Repenhardt reached right in
            front of Eusus. Stepping forward, he drove his fist deep. Eusus,
            caught off-guard while preparing for a follow-up attack, had no
            chance to dodge. A direct hit to the solar plexus sent him flying
            back more than five meters.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Despite being reinforced above Eldrad’s standards, the impact was
            enough to damage his internals. Swallowing blood forcibly, Eusus
            barely managed to regain his balance. Seizing the moment, Repenhardt
            launched a relentless assault, spinning and delivering a barrage of
            kicks, driving Eusus back.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus tried to retaliate with his sword, but it was no easy feat.
            His opponent was expertly targeting his blind spots, continuously
            jabbing with punches and kicks. Expletives flew from his mouth
            involuntarily.
          </p>
          <p>‘Damn! How can he be so fast!’</p>
          <p>
            Moving side to side, trying to evade, it seemed as if he was facing
            clones of his opponent, such was the speed. Even after pushing his
            body to the limits with Eldrad enhancement, he couldn’t keep up.
          </p>
          <p>It was clear! This man was an Aura wielder!</p>
          <p>
            ‘No! What would an Aura wielder want, skulking around in the dead of
            night!’
          </p>
          <p>
            Grinding his teeth, Eusus fortified his defensive stance. Swinging
            his sword widely would only allow his opponent to get closer, so his
            only option was to position the blade to block the attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus, who had been steadily pushed back, finally allowed his
            opponent’s fist to strike his abdomen.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            It was a punch so powerful that the defensive magic cast by Eldrad
            shattered momentarily. Eusus’s body was lifted into the air. The
            pain made him widen his eyes, and he was momentarily deluded into
            thinking a hole had been punched through his stomach.
          </p>
          <p>‘It hit!’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, wearing a triumphant expression, launched his body
            forward. Although he struck over the armor, Gym Unbreakable had
            techniques to deliver impact through armor. He was certain he had
            properly transmitted the shock through the feel in his hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Eusus mustered his remaining strength and recited
            the promised spell.
          </p>
          <p>“The King of Winter, cover the world!”</p>
          <p>
            A blizzard arose, beginning to freeze Repenhardt’s limbs. Of course,
            his well-trained body would not easily succumb to frostbite, but the
            instant freezing slowed his movements unavoidably. While Repenhardt
            was breaking the ice clinging to him with brute strength, Eusus
            recited another prepared spell.
          </p>
          <p>“Unyielding strength, rise anew!”</p>
          <p>
            Magical runes on the surface of Eldrad glowed. Healing magic
            activated, starting to heal his internal injuries. In a moment,
            Eusus’s complexion returned to its original color. Watching Eusus
            regain his stance, Repenhardt clenched his teeth. To have seized the
            momentum only to lose it!
          </p>
          <p>“Tch…”</p>
          <p>Catching his breath, Eusus pointed his sword and calmly spoke.</p>
          <p>
            “I do not understand why someone as capable as an Aura User would
            resort to such actions.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being pushed back repeatedly, there was no sign of defeat in
            Eusus’s eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Until now, he hadn’t properly gauged his opponent’s strength,
            contributing to his setbacks. No matter how much power he possessed
            to rival that of an Aura User, he ultimately wasn’t one. He lacked
            the ability to instantly assess an opponent’s skill and respond
            appropriately with just his senses.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, it was different. Assuming his opponent was an Aura User,
            he would adapt a suitable countermeasure!
          </p>
          <p>Eusus declared with a murderous intent.</p>
          <p>“The sword of Tenes is second to none, even without Aura!”</p>
        </div>

          <p>
            [ Chapter 56 ]<br />
            Eusus’s precise strikes continuously occupied Repenhardt’s defenses
            from all directions. Dodging the attacks with learned movements
            wasn’t too hard, but magic attacks flew in each time to disrupt his
            timing, making Repenhardt break into a cold sweat as they exchanged
            blows repeatedly.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, this is troublesome…’</p>
          <p>
            Back when he was a magician, aura users were the most troublesome
            opponents for him. The powerful force of their aura could easily
            overpower and nullify most magics with sheer strength. Teslon, the
            original owner of this body, was a prime example. Teslon the Fist
            King, with his formidable aura, could ignore the compatibility of
            magic and charge forward like a bull, even taking lives in the
            process.
          </p>
          <p>
            He often cursed such brute force back in the day. But now, facing
            the opposite situation…
          </p>
          <p>‘Magic is quite despicable too, this…’</p>
          <p>
            Facing it from the other side, he found that whenever he tried to
            make a move, magic would immediately hinder and drag him down,
            driving him to frustration. It seemed this was why the saying “to
            understand another’s feelings, you must walk a mile in their shoes”
            existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, Eldrad itself was a significant threat. The metal Eldril,
            from which Eldrad was made, was a powerful magic metal highly valued
            even during the Silver Age. Repenhardt’s mountain-crushing attacks
            fell just short of breaking the Eldril. At best, he could only
            manage to dent it with his full power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, denting pure Eldril was already beyond human limits. It’s not
            for no reason that aura users were called superhumans. However, the
            situation remained disadvantageous for him.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaat!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus kept attacking Repenhardt with consecutive shouts. Initially,
            Repenhardt had the upper hand, but as time passed, the situation
            gradually reversed. Unlike Repenhardt, Eusus could recover his
            wounds and fatigue with the magic power of Eldrad. Moreover, there
            was a significant problem.
          </p>
          <p>‘Damn, I can’t openly use my aura…’</p>
          <p>
            The biggest reason for being cornered was that Repenhardt was in a
            position where he couldn’t manifest his aura externally.
          </p>
          <p>
            His golden aura was too conspicuous. Most auras had a unique color
            depending on the martial faction, typically ranging from red to blue
            hues, with some individuals showcasing green or purple auras for
            more personality.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Gym Unbreakable had a unique philosophy, which was
            reflected in the color of his aura as well. The only martial faction
            across the continent with a golden aura was Gym Unbreakable. Being
            in a situation where he had even masked himself to steal, revealing
            his identity was out of the question.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s black attire was gradually stained red. Eusus’s sword,
            armed with magic powerful enough to cut through his steel-like body,
            swung down. As the attack continued, Eusus cocked his head in
            confusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            “How strange. Such physical agility can’t be explained unless you’re
            an Aura user. Yet, you can’t manifest Aura?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually, Eusus’s blade made a long cut across Repenhardt’s
            shoulder. Blood spurted as Repenhardt clutched at his shoulder,
            groaning.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            Watching Repenhardt stagger, Eusus confidently opened his mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It seems you’ve just awakened your Aura. Then, you’re no match for
            me!”
          </p>
          <p>Eusus raised his sword vertically, his eyes gleaming fiercely.</p>

          <p>“Let’s end this!”</p>
          <p>He leaped into the air, shouting loudly.</p>
          <p>
            “Awaken, Eldrad! Rise, Eldran! Grant me the power to destroy
            everything!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus soared into the sky, his entire body covered in a golden
            light, as if another moon had risen in the night sky. Terrifying
            magical power began to gather at the tip of the magic sword Eldran.
            Repenhardt’s face paled.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn, this is really dangerous!”</p>
          <p>
            It was clearly a magic formula unique to Eldrad, and Repenhardt
            could not identify it. However, he could distinctly feel its
            destructive power. As Eusus swung his sword down, he shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Light of Eldril!”</p>
          <p>
            The slash tore through the air. A golden flash, like an aurora,
            surged with tremendous force towards Repenhardt. An inevitable,
            critical strike! It was at that moment Repenhardt thought of death.
          </p>
          <p>‘Wait? Golden light?’</p>
          <p>Brightening up, Repenhardt raised his arms in defense.</p>
          <p>“Thanks for being the Golden Knight!”</p>
          <p>‘What does that mean?’</p>
          <p>
            Confused, Eusus watched as the Light of Eldril struck Repenhardt. At
            that moment, he lifted his Aura all over his body and spun it.
          </p>
          <p>“Spiral Guard!”</p>
          <p>
            Enveloped in a murky light, his manifested Aura was completely
            indistinguishable. The flash and the spinning Aura collided.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            A thunderous sound erupted. Viscount Kelberen’s castle vibrated as
            the atmosphere resonated, and a storm swept through. The soldiers of
            the viscount’s family all clung to the ground, trembling.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>“What in the world is this!”</p>
          <p>
            And in that burst of light, Repenhardt was sent flying through the
            air. Eusus’s mouth dropped open as he saw Repenhardt scattering a
            trail of blood.
          </p>
          <p>“Good heavens! He blocked the Light of Eldril!”</p>
          <p>
            Surprised, Eusus swiftly took to the air, beginning his pursuit of
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had indeed blocked the light of Eldril. However, that
            didn’t mean he was in any better condition.
          </p>

          <p>“I was a bit late…”</p>
          <p>
            It was a good idea to shift his approach, but the timing was
            slightly off. The light of Eldril, which he had failed to completely
            deflect, mercilessly ravaged his body. He felt intense pain all
            over. There was no strength left in his limbs. It was a sensation
            similar to what he had experienced in his previous life, when he was
            hit by Teslon’s strike.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it! I can’t end up like that again!”</p>
          <p>
            He could feel Eusus’s presence chasing him from a distance. If he
            lost his focus now, the outcome would be all too clear. Struggling
            to maintain his fading consciousness, Repenhardt twisted his body in
            midair.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh, tah!”</p>
          <p>
            After adjusting his posture, he landed on top of the city wall. It
            was more of a crash landing than a proper landing. Even as he
            tumbled messily on the ground, Repenhardt used his momentum to
            launch himself into the air again, heading towards the castle tower.
            As he did, the sight of the dark river came into view.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the Yaham River. For a moment, his blurry eyes sparkled with
            light.
          </p>
          <p>“A way out!”</p>
          <p>
            With the last of his strength, Repenhardt jumped off the cliff. His
            form plummeted endlessly down the cliff. It was the middle of
            winter, and naturally, the surface of the river was solidly frozen.
          </p>
          <p>Crack!</p>
          <p>
            Breaking through the thick ice, Repenhardt plunged into the river.
            When Eusus, who had hurriedly followed, looked down, Repenhardt was
            already out of sight.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was only later that the knights of the Tenes arrived at the
            castle tower where Eusus was. Lot inquired about his well-being.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you alright, Sir Eusus?”</p>
          <p>
            Looking down at the dark Yaham River, Eusus spoke in a calm voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Quickly identify the relics, Sir Lot. We need to know what he took
            with him.”
          </p>
          <p>Nodding, Sir Lot ordered his knights. Eusus added,</p>
          <p>
            “Prepare the search party as well. We cannot let him get away like
            this.”
          </p>
          <p>Sir Lot, looking skeptical, questioned,</p>
          <p>“Could he not already be dead?”</p>
          <p>
            Given the harsh winter and the mountainous region, the river was
            freezing cold. Falling into the river water under such conditions,
            it seemed logical to assume that survival was unlikely.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Eusus shook his head. Despite the victory, his face seemed
            somewhat gloomy.
          </p>
          <p>“He is not someone that would die from just this…”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>

          <p>
            Siris suddenly opened her eyes wide and sat up from where she had
            been lying down. Sillan, who had been trying to fall asleep on the
            opposite side, rubbed his eyes and asked as he got up,
          </p>
          <p>“Why, Siris?”</p>
          <p>
            Without a word, Siris looked out the window of the room. The serene
            blue moonlight illuminated the surroundings. Staring at the shadow
            of a dark castle faintly visible beyond the star-filled night sky,
            Siris quietly muttered,
          </p>
          <p>“I have a bad feeling.”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan cocked his head in confusion. Siris continued with a tense
            face,
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t know. I just have a bad feeling…”</p>
          <p>
            Elves, descendants of fairies, retain a faint spiritual sense and
            sometimes have premonitions about the misfortunes of relatives or
            acquaintances. Although the fact that elves are descendants of
            fairies has been forgotten in the current era, it is known that they
            often have a keen sense.
          </p>
          <p>Recalling that fact, Sillan’s expression hardened.</p>
          <p>“Could something have happened to Mr. Repen?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Black smoke rose from various parts of the city. From a balcony in
            the Hall of the Abyss, the heart of the Imperial Palace Gairak, a
            lean middle-aged man watched the scene. He was Repenhardt, the
            Emperor of the Antares Empire, called the Demon King by all humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked indifferently at the burning city he had built.
            The wrinkles above his eyes, barely softened even by powerful magic,
            twitched slightly.
          </p>
          <p>A voice came from behind him,</p>
          <p>“…I bid you farewell, Your Majesty.”</p>
          <p>
            It was the voice of Tassid, the orc warrior. The tone was simple,
            but the emotion of agony within it was unmistakably felt. Repenhardt
            turned around silently. The muscular orc warrior was kneeling,
            unable to lift his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kneeling before him was not only Tassid. A vicious-looking old
            troll, a dwarf with a bushy white beard, and a beautiful elf woman
            were also on their knees. Their faces looked as though they could
            burst into tears at any moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Attila, Makelin, Siris…” Repenhardt chuckled, shrugging his
            shoulders.
          </p>
          <p>“Why such long faces? It’s as if you’re looking at the dead.”</p>
          <p>The Emperor’s laughter was something they couldn’t share.</p>
          <p>The entire continent had joined hands.</p>
          <p>All of humanity had taken up swords towards a single goal.</p>
          <p>
            To exterminate humanity’s foe, the Demon King Repenhardt, kings from
            various nations united and gathered an army. The number was no less
            than two million. This staggering number, which completely
            disregarded the norms of warfare, could truly be said to be all the
            manpower the continent’s humans had to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Every magician across the continent supported the two million strong
            human coalition with their magic. Every clergy across the continent
            blessed the troops with divine power. Aura users from all kingdoms
            led them in an invasion of the Empire.
          </p>
          <p>
            The number, two million, possessed an absolute power that ignored
            any formidable magic or advanced strategy. Even Repenhardt, who had
            always ended wars by sweeping away the invading forces with his
            magic, found his usual tactics ineffective this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how powerful a magician Repenhardt was, he had only one
            body. The human coalition cleverly avoided him, dispersing their
            forces and steadily eroding the Antares Empire. If Repenhardt
            reclaimed one castle with his formidable magic, the next day twenty
            castles would be invaded simultaneously. Faced with an overwhelming
            war of attrition, the Antares Empire’s forces were inevitably pushed
            back.
          </p>
          <p>
            Countless orc warriors became spirits under human swords. Even
            trolls, with their endless regenerative capabilities, became
            exhausted and worn down by the overwhelming numbers, eventually
            being torn apart and killed. The blood of dwarves formed rivers, and
            the bodies of elves created mountains. And as much as these races
            bled, several times more human blood flowed onto the land. The
            atrocious flames of war blazed throughout the empire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Half a year later, the human coalition had invaded up to Repenheim,
            the last bastion of the Antares Empire.

          <p>
            [ Chapter 57 ]<br />
            Leaning against the balcony, Repenhardt lifted his head. Beyond the
            capital’s walls, the plains and even beyond the horizon, he could
            see the densely packed human armies lined up. No matter where he
            turned his head, all sides were surrounded by the human military
            force. Suddenly, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Really, they’ve mobilized foolishly. Are they all intent on ruining
            their countries after a single war? How on earth do they plan to
            handle the aftermath with such forces?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The High Priest of Al Fort, Makelin, replied with a gloomy voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That much, Your Majesty, indicates that they cannot tolerate our
            existence.”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt clicked his tongue again.</p>
          <p>
            “Tch, if the numerical difference was manageable, I’d consider
            making a move, but this…”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was known to the world that Repenhardt leads a million-strong
            army of darkness (which was also why the kings of various nations
            didn’t think twice about gathering a force of two million), but in
            reality, the total number of all non-human races within the Antares
            Empire barely exceeds five hundred thousand, including men, women,
            and children. In fact, the population capable of fighting doesn’t
            even reach two hundred thousand. And half of them had already
            perished in the war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt turned around to lean his back against the balcony and
            waved his hand with a calm tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, now that we’ve seen their faces, let’s say our farewells.”
          </p>
          <p>“I’m sorry, Your Majesty…”</p>
          <p>Attila’s head bowed even deeper.</p>
          <p>
            Though Attila’s loyalty to Repenhardt was unmatched by anyone, he
            had to leave the Emperor’s side now. Not as an individual, but as
            the leader responsible for the survival of the entire troll race.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Four Heavenly Kings were not merely the Emperor’s bodyguards.
            They were representatives and protectors of their races and were
            responsible for the wellbeing of their people.
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, Repenhardt gave them an order:</p>
          <p>
            -Lead your kin to refuge. Never let the spirit of your races be
            extinguished.
          </p>
          <p>They had barely escaped slavery.</p>
          <p>They were barely reclaiming their ancestors’ culture and pride.</p>
          <p>
            Surviving wasn’t enough. They couldn’t afford to lose the pride they
            had just found again. If they survived only to fall into the hands
            of humans and become slaves again, they wouldn’t have the face to
            meet those who had died.
          </p>
          <p>“But…”</p>
          <p>Tassid grimaced and then struggled to speak.</p>
          <p>
            “…Is it truly impossible for you to come with us, Your Majesty?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Haven’t I explained already, Tassid? That there is a chance for
            escape precisely because I am here in Gairak?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall situation had already tilted against them. Repenhardt
            had to admit it.
          </p>
          <p>
            What mattered was how much of the non-human races’ strength could be
            preserved while escaping from the capital.
          </p>
          <p>
            To fulfill his purpose, Repenhardt deliberately exposed his
            existence. It was, after all, Repenhardt’s life that was of utmost
            importance to the human alliance forces. As long as he was confirmed
            to be in the imperial capital, the human alliance forces could not
            fully commit to stopping the escape attempts of the other races.
            Missing the opportunity to capture Repenhardt would essentially be
            no different from losing the war.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, Repenhardt volunteered to be the bait to facilitate
            the escape of all the other races from the capital.
          </p>

          <p>“I know that, but still, how can His Majesty be left alone…”</p>
          <p>In an instant, Repenhardt cut him off with a shout.</p>
          <p>
            “Tassid! Do not forsake your duty led by your emotions! You are,
            before anything, one of my Four Heavenly Kings and a great warrior
            of the orcs!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Tassid clenched his teeth and swallowed his words. Then, he turned
            his back, returning to his kin to carry out the last command of his
            lord to whom he had sworn loyalty.
          </p>
          <p>“I will go as well.”</p>
          <p>
            Attila rose to his feet. He, like Tassid, had a duty to lead the
            trolls in escaping the capital. The old troll shaman, with a voice
            full of sorrow, offered his last farewell.
          </p>
          <p>“Your Majesty, please take good care of yourself…”</p>
          <p>“Be careful, Attila.”</p>
          <p>
            The sight of the orc and troll leaving the balcony was truly
            desolate. Repenhardt turned his head with a bitter smile. To his
            left, facing an old dwarf with a gloomy expression, he shrugged his
            shoulders.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I feel sorry for Al Fort. After all, the gods had vouched for us,
            only for it to end in defeat.”
          </p>
          <p>The dwarf, Makelin, also responded with a bitter smile.</p>
          <p>“It’s not a guarantee; it’s a divine mandate.”</p>
          <p>“That’s the same thing, really.”</p>
          <p>
            The dwarves entrusted their divine protection to Repenhardt a good
            ten years ago, even before the Antares Empire came into existence.
            Unlike other races, which scattered and were entrusted to him on a
            clan-by-clan basis, all dwarf tribes united and came under
            Repenhardt’s wing at once, due to the divine mandate received by the
            dwarves’ high priest, Makelin.
          </p>
          <p>
            ⌈He who, accompanied by an elf and following the guide of an orc,
            shall pass through the abyss of Daiman, and who shall emerge upon
            breaking the pillar of Hockril, follow him. For he shall twist fate
            and bring salvation.⌋
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, Repenhardt, along with Siris and Tassid, was in the
            midst of exploring the dungeon Daiman. During the exploration, they
            encountered a pillar with a peculiar spatial distortion magic and,
            in the course of research, accidentally destroyed it, which turned
            out to be connected to the dwarves’ sanctuary and Al Fort’s temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt chuckled as he reminisced, “I was really taken aback at
            that time. Even after smashing half of the temple, instead of
            getting angry, the dwarves rushed over and praised me as a savior. I
            couldn’t grasp the situation.”
          </p>
          <p>Makelin also smiled softly at the memory.</p>
          <p>
            Since that day, the dwarves had come under Repenhardt, showing deep
            trust and loyalty that did not fade even as the imperial capital
            burned. The same went for other species as well…
          </p>
          <p>Makelin bowed his head and made the sign of the cross.</p>
          <p>“May Al Fort bless us, that we may meet again.”</p>
          <p>“I hope so too. Farewell, Makelin.”</p>
          <p>
            After sending Makelin on his way, Repenhardt’s gaze turned to the
            last remaining elf woman.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris stood up with a calm voice, her determined appearance drawing
            a bitter smile from him. Although she was showing the dignified
            attitude of the elves’ leader now, the night before had been a
            complete disaster.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Lord Repenhardt! Is there really no other way? It’s too dangerous
            for even you to take on the continent’s strongest alone!”
          </p>

          <p>“Siris, my love. The man you chose is not so frail.”</p>
          <p>“You become frail sometimes!”</p>
          <p>
            “…Now, why are we talking about bedroom issues at a time like this…”
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t know! Let’s go together!”</p>
          <p>“Haven’t I explained? If I move, I can’t save the others.”</p>
          <p>“Then I won’t go either!”</p>
          <p>“…Then who will lead the elves?”</p>
          <p>“I don’t know! Anyway, I will stay by Lord Repenhardt’s side!”</p>
          <p>“No, but…”</p>
          <p>Illogical, irrational, emotional – a perfect storm of hysteria.</p>
          <p>‘I thought I was going to die calming her down.’</p>
          <p>
            But it seemed she had calmed down significantly overnight. To his
            composed lover, Repenhardt spoke in a tender voice.
          </p>
          <p>“…Now, you should go as well.”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris looked straight at Repenhardt and whispered with strong
            resolve,
          </p>
          <p>“I will wait.”</p>
          <p>
            That lovely expression made Repenhardt smile even more bitterly. Did
            he really want to part with Siris? But the situation was too cruel.
            Repenhardt was not cruel enough to ask her to wait indefinitely for
            him, whose future was so uncertain.
          </p>
          <p>So he replied,</p>
          <p>
            “Fate is unpredictable. Siris, if something happens to me, you
            should meet someone good too…”
          </p>
          <p>“I will definitely wait.”</p>
          <p>
            “Ah, of course, wouldn’t I too wish to meet you again? But the
            situation is not good. They seem to have come prepared, so it won’t
            be easy…”
          </p>
          <p>“No! Matter! What! I will wait!”</p>
          <p>…</p>
          <p>
            Looking at those stubborn eyes, Repenhardt couldn’t help but let out
            a chuckle. Siris hugged Repenhardt’s neck, and Repenhardt wrapped
            his arms around Siris’s waist.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the burning capital behind them, the two lovers shared a kiss
            in silence.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>

          <p>Groaning, Repenhardt opened his eyes.</p>
          <p>‘It’s been a while since I’ve dreamt of a past life.’</p>
          <p>
            It was a fragment of gloomy memories, sorrowful recollections.
            Despite their role as bait, all the Four Kings were ultimately
            killed by humans. It couldn’t necessarily be considered a failed
            strategy. Without it, escape would have been entirely impossible,
            given the severe disparity in military force. At that time, there
            was no other option.
          </p>
          <p>‘Sigh…’</p>
          <p>
            Thinking of the dead Four Kings made one side of his chest ache.
            However, Repenhardt tried hard to shake off the thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It’s okay. It hasn’t happened yet. It’s something that can be
            stopped.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Trying to lighten his mood, Repenhardt got up. But then, he
            grimaced. Moving his body brought an excruciating pain throughout.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ugh, I’m seriously damaged.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue. Using aura to check his body’s
            condition, he was astonished. Several ribs were broken, internal
            organs were damaged, and muscles were torn, staining the bandages
            red.
          </p>
          <p>‘Surely, the mightiest magical artifact, Eldrad.’</p>
          <p>
            Despite his intensely trained body, it had been reduced to this
            state with a single blow. Eldrad’s reputation was not unfounded.
          </p>
          <p>‘Such foolishness.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt shook his head. The skill of Eusus, who wielded the
            magical armor Eldrad, was indeed comparable to that of aura users.
            Indeed, he possessed a strength that was clearly superior to the
            renowned Golden Knight, far from the indulgences of Lantas.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, it wasn’t beyond Repenhardt’s ability to handle. Had he fought
            with his full strength from the start, without limiting his aura, he
            could have surely won.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the end, the problem lay in his mindset. Even amidst a
            life-and-death struggle, thinking ‘I am in the midst of theft.’, ‘I
            must not reveal my identity.’, he fought with self-imposed
            limitations. And not being able to break free from those mental
            shackles even when the crisis was upon him, what foolishness was
            this?
          </p>
          <p>‘Really disgraceful.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt let out a dry laugh, feeling the weight of the problem
            through this event.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re being too timid, the current me…”</p>
          <p>
            Of course, those who died at the hands of Repenhardt, who had
            recklessly rampaged through the Principality of Chatan, would burst
            out in grievance if they heard him being called timid. However, his
            words didn’t carry that meaning.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had already failed once in his past life. Despite being the
            strongest magician of ancient and modern times, he ended up hated by
            the entire continent and met his death.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, after being reborn, he was too cautious about his
            surroundings, always on the lookout. Filled with the thought that he
            shouldn’t come forward as the Demon King, he was only thinking of
            hiding his existence somehow.
          </p>
          <p>
            But upon reflection, there was no need for such thoughts at this
            point.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stealing because you have to hide your aura? What would happen if
            his identity was revealed? At worst, it would just become known that
            a powerful martial artist, oddly enough, was caught stealing. Well,
            his actions might reach Gerard’s ears (indeed, a part of him was
            unconsciously scared, which was why he tried to hide his identity),
            but thinking about it, Gerard’s personality was such that he would
            likely praise him for being so spirited, rather than scold him.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s good that he doesn’t want to repeat the failure of his past
            life. However, being afraid of failure and holding back won’t
            accomplish anything. It’s time to move forward without looking back.
            Being afraid of failure is for after you’ve achieved something worth
            failing over.
          </p>
          <p>“I really did something stupid…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt chuckled lightly, feeling relieved in his heart after
            recognizing the problem clearly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, anyhow, the outcome isn’t bad. I’ve gained a good lesson and
            managed to secure the Voice of Elucion properly.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a much relaxed face, Repenhardt rummaged through his pocket and
            pulled out a square black box. It looked like an ordinary box at a
            glance, not at all like a magical artifact. However, it was a
            premium artifact, top of its class even in the Silver Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With this, I’ve also moved a step forward in regaining my magic.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smiled contentedly. Though he paid a steep price, he was
            satisfied with the result since he got what he wanted.
          </p>
          <p>“Ouch! It hurts to laugh again.”</p>
          <p>
            Of course, the fact that the price was quite painful remained
            unchanged.

          <p>
            [ Chapter 58 ]<br />
            Repenhardt, while massaging his sides, momentarily shelved his
            thoughts and checked his body’s condition again. His injuries were
            severe all over, but particularly his legs, which had not been fully
            protected by aura, were in terrible shape. The bones in his legs
            were completely shattered into fragments.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Still, considering that I was practically hit on my bare body
            because my aura defense was delayed… it’s more surprising that I’m
            still intact.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether he should marvel at the magic of Eldrad that had rendered
            his steel-like physique into this state, or at the resilience of his
            body for being relatively unscathed after facing such powerful
            magic, was a puzzling matter. Normally, injuries of this magnitude
            would result in serious disabilities.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s been a while since I’ve been injured like this.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked down at his paralyzed legs with a calm expression.
            By the standards of Gym Unbreakable, this was not considered a
            serious injury but rather ‘just right after a sparring and beat
            training session’. Before awakening his aura, he used to live with
            injuries of this extent every day, so there was no reason for him to
            be surprised.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘With this condition… if I use aura to realign the shattered bones
            and flesh and enhance my healing abilities, I should be able to get
            up in about three days.’
          </p>
          <p>While manipulating his aura, Repenhardt looked around.</p>
          <p>‘But where am I?’</p>
          <p>
            It was a small room. The walls made of granite were smoothly
            polished, and only a thin curtain was placed on the door side. What
            was peculiar was that the ceiling was quite low, suggesting that
            Repenhardt would have to bend over significantly if he were to stand
            up.
          </p>
          <p>“This must be…”</p>
          <p>
            Something dawned on Repenhardt as he inspected the bed he was lying
            on. The bed he was sitting on was made by stacking four small beds
            together. It was too wide to be a child’s bed and too short to be an
            adult’s. And Repenhardt knew exactly who would use a bed of this
            size.
          </p>
          <p>“As I thought…”</p>
          <p>
            It was then. He sensed someone approaching and soon after, someone
            parted the curtain and entered.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh? You’re awake.”</p>
          <p>
            Looking at the owner of the voice, Repenhardt instinctively nodded.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was as he had expected. There was only one in the continent who
            would use a bed of this size.
          </p>
          <p>A dwarf.</p>
          <p>
            Dwarves, the sons of the earth, with an average height of around 140
            centimeters and shoulder width exceeding one meter, are compact yet
            solidly built.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dwarf who appeared after parting the curtain had white hair and
            brown eyes, his chest covered with a lush beard typical of a dwarf,
            he inquired about Repenhardt’s well-being.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you feeling alright?”</p>
          <p>“Ah, yes. Somehow…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt inadvertently bowed his head and looked at the person in
            front of him.
          </p>

          <p>
            Based on the beard’s length and fullness, he seemed to be at least
            three hundred years old, an old dwarf. To humans, all dwarves might
            seem to have bushy beards, bulging eyes, and round, flat bodies, but
            it wasn’t hard to tell their age once you knew what to look for.
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless, it was clear they had saved him. Repenhardt expressed
            his gratitude politely.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thank you for saving me. I apologize for any trouble I’ve caused.”
          </p>
          <p>The old dwarf waved his hand with a warm smile.</p>
          <p>“Ha ha ha, think nothing of it. My name is Hetos.”</p>
          <p>“…Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            Even as they introduced themselves, Repenhardt felt inwardly
            flustered. Such exchanges would not be awkward among humans, but…
          </p>
          <p>‘What’s going on? Why is the atmosphere so pleasant?’</p>
          <p>
            Given the current situation on the continent, it was almost
            impossible for dwarves to harbor good feelings towards humans. It
            was rare for dwarves to save dying humans. Perhaps these dwarves
            were just naturally good-natured. Still, it seemed unlikely for them
            to look so favorably upon him.
          </p>
          <p>Moreover, the goodwill didn’t stop at mere looks.</p>
          <p>
            “It might be hard for you to get up yet… Can you eat something?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes? Yes…”</p>
          <p>“That’s good. Miss Tilla, please bring what we’ve prepared.”</p>
          <p>
            Hetos called out beyond the curtain, and shortly after, a dwarf
            woman with a cute demeanor entered the room carrying a large tray.
            She appeared to be in her early teens if judged by human standards,
            but a crucial difference made it clear she was a dwarf woman.
          </p>
          <p>‘Seeing her chest, she’s of marriageable age.’</p>
          <p>
            Dwarf women often maintained a youthful, petite figure into middle
            age by human standards, only their chests becoming fuller as they
            aged. This is why some humans with unique tastes sometimes took
            young dwarf women as concubines. Though, the demand was not very
            high.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, for dwarves, it’s beards for men and chests for women!
            That’s the easiest way to distinguish their ages. There’s no
            sinister motive behind Repenhardt stealing glances at the chest of a
            woman he’s just met out of the blue.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, you’ve awakened. That’s good. Please eat.”</p>
          <p>
            A dwarf woman, known as Tilla, placed a tray on one corner of the
            bed with a gentle smile. On the tray, there was a large bowl filled
            with barley porridge.
          </p>
          <p>“Th-thank you.”</p>
          <p>
            Bowing his head once again, Repenhardt continued to be perplexed.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Dwarves aren’t supposed to like humans, so what’s going on here?’
          </p>
          <p>
            It would also be absurd to ask those who were treating him well,
            “Why are you being so nice to me?” Feeling awkward, Repenhardt
            picked up a spoon. As he began to eat the porridge, Hetos, looking
            pleased, opened the curtain again and left the room.
          </p>

          <p>“I shall go and bring the elder then.”</p>
          <p>
            His question was immediately answered when an old dwarf, referred to
            as the elder, appeared.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh! Have you awakened? The savior of our tribe!”</p>
          <p>“…Savior?”</p>
          <p>
            The white-haired old dwarf’s name was Gelpheid Delphistone. He was
            the elder of the dwarf tribe staying here and a priest serving the
            Al Fort. Listening to his explanation, Repenhardt immediately
            understood why they had been so friendly towards him.
          </p>
          <p>
            About six years ago, a prophecy from Al Fort was bestowed upon the
            High Priest of the dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “A being with a body of steel and supreme knowledge, who will appear
            riding the tears of the north wind through the path of darkness,
            follow him. He will be the one to twist fate and bring salvation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In simpler terms, it meant that a big and smart fellow would float
            down through an underground cave in ice water, and they should
            rescue him and treat him as their savior.
          </p>
          <p>
            The High Priest secretly informed all the dwarves across the
            continent of this prophecy, and every dwarf who had a cave in their
            dwelling connected to a river kept an unblinking watch. This place
            had an underground cave connected to a river as well, so Gelpheid
            had been setting a watch in that cave every winter for six years,
            waiting for someone to appear. And finally, last night, a large
            human came floating down, and they joyfully rescued him.
          </p>
          <p>“Haha…”</p>
          <p>
            After hearing the explanation, Repenhardt rubbed his forehead and
            let out a hollow laugh.
          </p>
          <p>He had grasped the situation immediately.</p>
          <p>‘Wow, Al Fort, you’ve changed your tune already.’</p>
          <p>
            If the prophecy was given six years ago, that was exactly when
            Repenhardt was reincarnated into this timeline. It meant that as
            soon as Repenhardt appeared in this time, Al Fort acted immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Such a quick response. You’ve messed up once but still willing to
            vouch for me. A benevolent, no, a gracious god.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt chuckled at this situation that transcended causality.
            This explained why these dwarves welcomed him, a stranger, with such
            open arms. It had been the same in his previous life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite feeling a bit hopeful, I decided to repeat the question I
            had asked before.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even so, to trust and treat a complete stranger based on that
            alone—do you mean to say that’s what happened?”
          </p>
          <p>
            As expected, the same response I had heard in my past life came
            back.
          </p>
          <p>“Would Al Fort ever speak insincerely?”</p>
          <p>
            The dwarf elder, Gelpheid, replied with unwavering confidence in his
            eyes. Repenhardt didn’t press any further and inwardly expressed his
            gratitude to Al Fort. After all, even for someone like Repenhardt,
            had he continued to be submerged in ice-cold water with his
            injuries, it would have been hard to guarantee his survival.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Thank you for believing in me once more. I’ll do better this time.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Gelpheid rose from his seat. As he was leaving the room, he spoke in
            a gentle voice, “It’s not good to have long conversations in front
            of the patient. For now, rest well and take care of your wounds.
            We’ll talk more later. I’ll leave Tilla here with you, so if you
            need anything, just let her know.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Tilla smiled brightly and sat down on a chair next to the bed.
            Repenhardt expressed his thanks and began to eat his porridge again.
            He needed to improve his physical condition as soon as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘At least, I need to recover enough to move around on my own two
            legs. Surely, I should be able to take care of my own needs?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though he intellectually knew Tilla was an adult woman, her
            appearance was that of a young girl (excluding certain aspects). He
            wasn’t brazen enough to ask her to help with such personal matters.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt quickly finished a bowl of barley porridge and held out
            the empty bowl with a longing tone in his voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Could I have some more porridge, please?”</p>
          <p>“You eat well. Just wait a moment.”</p>
          <p>
            With the face of a young girl but a mature woman’s smile, Tilla took
            the empty bowl and left the room. Repenhardt laid back down and
            began to manipulate his aura, healing his body while lost in
            thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Now that it’s come to this, I’m worried about Sillan and Siris. I
            hope nothing’s happened to them.’
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Early in the morning, on a street filled with morning sunlight in
            the domain of Viscount Kelberen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the sun that was no different from any other day, an entirely
            different scene was unfolding.
          </p>
          <p>“Chase them!”</p>
          <p>“Catch the thief!”</p>
          <p>
            A group of knights was leading numerous soldiers, rushing through
            the streets. And above them, on the rooftops of closely packed
            two-story houses, two figures were running frantically. A beautiful
            elf girl with platinum blonde hair and pointed ears visible through
            her short hair, and a boy with long red hair being led by her hand,
            frantically following behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the elf girl, Siris, reached the end of the roof, she stretched
            out her hand.
          </p>
          <p>“Grab my hand, Sillan!”</p>
          <p>“I already am!”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan replied almost screaming. Siris immediately pulled him onto
            her shoulder and leaped forward.
          </p>
          <p>“Ha!”</p>
          <p>
            With a light shout, the slender elf girl jumped across to the
            opposite roof, carrying an even more slender boy. Feeling a vast
            sense of weightlessness, Sillan muttered helplessly.
          </p>
          <p>“No, I am still a man, after all… being lifted like this…”</p>
          <p>
            Naturally, from his position on Siris’s shoulder, he could see the
            knights fervently chasing them down the road below. Seeing them
            pursue with such vigor, Sillan muttered helplessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Normally, you act as if you know everything about the world, but in
            the end, we got caught, foolish Mr. Repen. I had a bad feeling about
            this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan and Siris, waiting for Repenhardt to return, had to welcome
            uninvited guests before dawn even broke. Soldiers from Viscount
            Kelberen, along with the Tenes Knights, came to the inn to arrest
            the thieves’ associates. In such a rural domain, outsiders were
            rare, and someone of Repenhardt’s size was even rarer, so it was
            impossible to hide their association. The soldiers immediately
            surrounded the inn and stormed into the room where the two were
            staying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, neither of them was asleep. Thanks to Siris’s
            foreboding feeling, both were prepared to leave. Although it was a
            sudden attack, it allowed them to escape from the inn immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two continued to run, jumping from one house’s roof to another.
            Precisely, Siris was the one doing the jumping, while Sillan was
            merely carried along, but that did not mean Sillan was entirely a
            burden.
          </p>
          <p>
            “O Philanence, watch over your servant, make her leap endlessly like
            a mountain goat!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Whenever Siris struggled, Sillan would relieve her fatigue and
            infuse her with vitality through his holy spells, while also
            amplifying her jumping ability, significantly aiding their escape.
            Instead of running on his weak legs, being carried and diligently
            casting holy spells was far more efficient.

          <p>
            [ Chapter 59 ]<br />
            However, no matter how much she ran, escaping the pursuers seemed
            impossible.
          </p>
          <p>“There they are!”</p>
          <p>“Drive them to the other side! Cut off their escape route!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, glancing down from the roof, frowned. The force pursuing them
            easily numbered over a hundred. It was a number far too large to
            evade.
          </p>
          <p>Moreover, their enemies were not just knights.</p>
          <p>“Oh dear, knight sir. They went that way.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks for the cooperation!”</p>
          <p>“They’re running that way!”</p>
          <p>“We’ll remember your loyalty!”</p>
          <p>
            The residents of Viscount Kelberen’s territory were also cooperating
            with the pursuers. Viscount Kelberen was a decent lord,
            well-regarded by his people. Being in the countryside, most had only
            ever seen chases akin to a child stealing apples being chased by the
            fruit vendor with a stick. Rather than out of high loyalty to the
            viscount, everyone seemed to treat the chase as some sort of
            exciting festival, eagerly pointing fingers.
          </p>
          <p>“There’s nowhere left to run!”</p>
          <p>
            Three swordsmen blocked Siris’s path after she had just jumped
            across two roofs in succession. They had anticipated her escape
            route and climbed up to the roof in advance. The knights drew their
            swords and formed an encirclement around Siris. One of the knights
            pointed his sword at her and shouted with a commanding voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Drop your weapons and surrender!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, assessing the situation, set Sillan down from her shoulder
            with a stern face. She also unclasped her long sword and gently laid
            it on the roof. To anyone watching, it was a clear sign of
            surrender, causing the knights to slightly relax their guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘After all, that elf, even being a Slayer, wouldn’t dare to attack
            three knights.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris then slowly took a small stick from her waistband. The knights
            were still smiling up to that point, not considering the small stick
            to be a weapon at all.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Siris exclaimed.</p>
          <p>“Nihillen!”</p>
          <p>
            The stick transformed into a bow of light. Before the knights could
            even react, Siris had already drawn the bowstring.
          </p>
          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            An arrow of light pierced through the shoulder of one of the
            knights.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            The knight screamed as he fell off the roof. Seizing the moment,
            Siris kicked up the long sword from the ground and caught it in
            midair.
          </p>
          <p>“Haah!”</p>
          <p>
            Drawing the sword, she charged at the knights, swiftly dodging to
            the side and delivering a series of slashes! Her movements, greatly
            amplified by Sillan’s power, were beyond what the unprepared knights
            could handle. Caught off guard by the precise and swift attack, even
            the seasoned knights could not respond in time and were sprayed with
            blood. From behind, Sillan exclaimed in shock.
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t, don’t kill them!”</p>
          <p>
            Swinging her sword to scatter blood, Siris replied with a cold
            voice, “I do not kill unnecessarily.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the knights who had fallen appeared to suffer, but their
            lives were not in danger. At that moment, Siris had exquisitely
            targeted only their thighs and calves, robbing them of their
            mobility. Sillan sighed in relief, looking at Siris with newfound
            respect.
          </p>

          <p>‘It’s fortunate that she didn’t kill them, but…’</p>
          <p>The coldness in her voice was frightening. In other words…</p>
          <p>‘It means she could kill if necessary, right?’</p>
          <p>
            After all, thinking about it, Siris had been merciless even in the
            Chatan Principality. She had spilled blood efficiently against those
            who came to capture her, even killing one.
          </p>
          <p>‘Considering she’s a Slayer, is this considered kind?’</p>
          <p>
            Elves are said to treasure life, but that’s usually the ordinary
            elves. No matter how you dress it up, swordsmanship is ultimately a
            skill for killing. A Slayer who specializes in such a skill and has
            an aversion to killing would not make for a good profession. By
            those standards, Siris was relatively benign.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go, Sillan.”</p>
          <p>“Uh, yeah.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan nodded and reached out his hand to Siris. Soldiers were still
            pursuing them, so there was no time to relax. They needed to escape
            the area quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carrying Sillan again, Siris dashed off with a running start to the
            next building.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“What happened?”</p>
          <p>
            “I’m sorry, Lord Eusus. They were more skilled than we thought…”
          </p>
          <p>Under Eusus’s urging, the middle-aged soldier bowed in apology.</p>
          <p>
            This middle-aged soldier, who was also the captain of the Viscount
            Kelberen’s guard, might not have been a knight, but he was reputed
            to maintain peace effectively within the lordship. However, his
            capabilities as a captain of a rural guard, where monster invasions
            were almost nonexistent and nighttime crimes were extremely rare,
            were simply inadequate to catch these ‘flying’ thieves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, there would be ways if they used bows or crossbows, but
            the renowned Golden Knight had explicitly requested they be captured
            alive.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching the obsequious captain, Eusus repeatedly grimaced. Then, he
            irritably whispered to the deputy commander, Sir Lot, standing
            beside him.
          </p>
          <p>“I told you we should have handled this ourselves, didn’t I?”</p>
          <p>Sir Lot gently bowed his head, placating Eusus.</p>
          <p>“You know that’s not possible, don’t you?”</p>
          <p>
            It would not look good for the Viscount Kelberen’s jurisdiction if
            the Tenes Knight Order took direct action, considering they were
            guests. Thus, they deliberately let the Viscount Kelberen’s family
            lead the capture effort, with themselves and the Tenes Knight Order
            supporting in a cooperative manner.
          </p>
          <p>“What do you plan to do if you miss out on this?”</p>
          <p>
            It was odd for Eusus, who understood the situation well, to be this
            impatient.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I don’t understand. It doesn’t seem like something worth making
            such a big fuss over.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot was internally puzzled. Of course, the thief from the night
            before was definitely not ordinary in skill. However, what he had
            taken was merely one small, unnamed box among the numerous relics of
            the Silver Age, its identity so obscure that it had not even been
            named. Although all relics of the Silver Age were valuable, it was
            not something to cause such an uproar over. Losing just that one
            should not have been a big deal, given the ample number of relics
            the Tenes Knights had collected.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘But why is he so anxious? Could that box actually be something
            incredibly important?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Lot remembered the pale look on Eusus’s face the moment the
            theft of the relic was reported. Perhaps there was something he
            didn’t know?
          </p>
          <p>As Sir Lot was lost in thought, a moment came.</p>
          <p>“That’s enough! I will handle this myself!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus drew the magic sword Eldran from his back. Sir Lot, surprised,
            said,
          </p>

          <p>
            “No, there’s no need for you, Eusus, to personally deal with such
            fellows…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Ignoring Sir Lot’s words, Eusus immediately plunged Eldran into the
            ground. It was indeed unusual. Normally, Eusus would have at least
            responded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaving a bewildered Sir Lot behind, Eusus began to chant a prepared
            incantation.
          </p>
          <p>“Awaken, Eldrad!”</p>
          <p>
            Golden light exploded, enveloping his entire body. Eusus, now
            wearing the magical armor Eldrad, lightly stamped his foot.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            With a loud explosion, a golden shadow flew up like a bird, dashing
            through the rooftops.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“Taaah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a sharp yell, a flash of the sword sparked. Three streaks of
            red blood sprayed into the air. Siris shouted after bringing down
            three knights with three slices, securing an escape route,
          </p>
          <p>“Sillan!”</p>
          <p>“Yep, I’m on it.”</p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah, when will Mr. Repen ever train me in building muscle? The pride
            of a man… sob sob.’
          </p>
          <p>
            As Sillan was indulging in leisurely thoughts, reaching out his
            hand, a resounding shout came from behind.
          </p>
          <p>“Cry out! Blade of the Wind!”</p>
          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            The atmosphere distorted, and a blurry shape of a blade aimed at the
            two, flying towards them. It was the 4th circle wind magic spell,
            Wind Smash.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The Wind Smash precisely split the space between Sillan and Siris,
            tearing through the rooftop. Sillan, startled, turned his head.
          </p>
          <p>“What, what’s that?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan turned his head and saw a knight clad in dazzling armor
            landing on the rooftop. From head to toe, he shone in brilliant
            gold. It was a sight so distinctive it could not be mistaken.
          </p>
          <p>“The Golden Knight of Graim!”</p>
          <p>
            After sealing off the opponent’s retreat with magic, Eusus von Tenes
            brandished his sword at Siris and Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>“This is the end, you rats.”</p>
          <p>
            Contrary to his usually polite demeanor, Eusus’s eyes were
            chillingly cold. Taking a moment to catch her breath, Siris suddenly
            charged, swinging her sword.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmph!”</p>
          <p>
            With a sneer, Eusus swung his magic sword Eldran from below upwards.
          </p>
          <p>“Rise, breath of the earth!”</p>
          <p>
            The sword wind rose, creating four whirlwinds that surrounded Siris
            on all sides, attempting to restrict her movements with wind instead
            of using more lethal magic to capture her alive.
          </p>
          <p>‘Got her.’</p>

          <p>
            Eusus, about to look away from Siris with an indifferent gaze,
            paused when suddenly Siris’s longsword moved swiftly left and right.
          </p>
          <p>“Taat!”</p>
          <p>
            Cutting through the wind with her sword should have been futile, but
            astonishingly, the blade cleaved through the whirlwinds, emitting
            sparks of electricity.
          </p>
          <p>Crackle!</p>
          <p>
            The four whirlwinds dissipated in an instant. At the same time,
            Siris slid up to Eusus’s chin, kicking off the rooftop. A ghastly
            blade light spread wide and swung fiercely.
          </p>
          <p>Clang!</p>
          <p>
            Their swords clashed, and Siris was thrown back. She thought she had
            found an opening, but Eusus had already counterattacked with the
            golden sword, deflecting her strike. The force of his counter was so
            fierce that Siris rolled across the rooftop without being able to
            regain her posture.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Groaning, Siris quickly got back on her feet, slightly bending her
            knees as she readied herself for battle again. Eusus, observing the
            longsword in her hand, showed a puzzled expression.
          </p>
          <p>“…That’s no ordinary sword.”</p>
          <p>
            It was impossible for a regular blade to cut through magical wind.
            Even if not as powerful as Eldran, the sword was clearly of
            significant magical quality.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, it was a sword once used by Lantas, an Aura User. The
            Rolpein Trading Company, known for having nothing but money,
            wouldn’t have bought a cheap sword for a valuable Aura User, would
            they?
          </p>
          <p>
            The longsword Siris now wielded was a precious item, likely to be
            carried only by the commander of a knightly order in a modest-sized
            nation. Of course, Eusus could not know the detailed circumstances,
            but he was certain that such a weapon was not meant to be wielded by
            an elf of a slave race.
          </p>
          <p>‘An elf wielding such a precious sword?’</p>
          <p>
            While Eusus momentarily pondered in astonishment, Sillan quickly
            recited a holy spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Philanence! Grant your servant the bravery of a lion. Let the
            strength of a giant infuse her armed hands, her eyes become as
            fierce as a hawk’s, and her legs strong as a bull’s to strike down
            her enemies!”
          </p>
          <p>
            This was known as the ‘Full Service of the Goddess’. Siris’s entire
            body sparkled in pink, emitting an incredible aura. Eusus von Tenes
            was even more astonished upon seeing Sillan. With such skill, it was
            clear to anyone that he was a high priest.
          </p>
          <p>“Indeed…”</p>
          <p>
            To think, the man jumping over the wall was an aura user, and the
            slave he had brought along wielded an extremely valuable magic
            sword. Now, a girl who seemed like a mere novice pilgrim was
            demonstrating high-level divine power.
          </p>
          <p>“They were not just any thieves.”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing Eusus’s knowing expression, Sillan waved his hands
            dismissively.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, I admit it’s understandable to be mistaken, but actually,
            it’s…”
          </p>
          <p>“Attack!”</p>
          <p>
            Cutting off Sillan’s words, Siris charged again with her
            significantly enhanced physical abilities. Eusus calmly countered
            the attack. Sparks flew in the air as several sword strikes were
            exchanged in a flash.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Clearly, this isn’t a situation to be resolved with conversation.’
          </p>
          <p>Tsking, Sillan began to chant once more.</p>
          <p>
            “Philanence, strike down the enemies before us with your holy mace!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Pink light hammers flew wildly. Eusus frowned. He had seen high
            priests occasionally use such divine spells, but he had never seen
            someone shower down hammers of holy light like a storm.
          </p>
          <p>‘Is she really some sort of bishop?’</p>
          <p>
            Well, he was surprised, but that didn’t mean the opponent was too
            strong to contend with. He was the Golden Knight of Graim, a magic
            swordsman of the aura wielder class.
          </p>
          <p>“The trajectory of the heavens, flowing with the wind.”</p>
          <p>
            Magical currents formed behind Eusus, swirling through the air and
            striking down the incoming pink hammers all at once. Sillan’s
            hammers of holy light, engulfed in powerful magic, were instantly
            dissipated into the air.
          </p>
          <p>“My spell was dismissed so easily?”</p>
          <p>
            Ignoring Sillan’s astonished voice, Eusus focused on the elf girl in
            front of him. His swordsmanship, which had been focused on defense,
            gradually shifted to offense. Having gauged the opponent’s
            capabilities, there was no need for delay.
          </p>
          <p>
            The golden magic sword Eldran began to press Siris increasingly. She
            groaned, being pushed back more and more.

          <p>
            [ Chapter 60 ]<br />
            Repenhardt continued to walk along the outskirts of the commune. The
            village was quite deserted. The elders sat in front of their caves,
            smoking pipes, while a few young dwarves ran around, then hid their
            bodies in fear upon seeing Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each one was thin and looked unwell. Dwarves were known for their
            small but sturdy stature. However, the children and elders here were
            all skinny, merely small due to malnutrition, lacking the vibrant
            atmosphere that a village should have. Instead, only the lifeless
            eyes of children and elderly lay scattered around like corpses.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s like a graveyard,’ Repenhardt thought to himself.</p>
          <p>
            The difference was stark compared to the dwarves of the Antares
            Empire. This was the difference between those who were enslaved and
            those who were not. Repenhardt suddenly turned to Tilla and asked,
          </p>
          <p>“How many people live here?”</p>
          <p>“Including children, around sixty.”</p>
          <p>“All of them belong to Viscount Kelberen?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, they are slaves of the Kelberen family.”</p>
          <p>
            Tilla’s expression became slightly submerged in sorrow. After a
            moment of silence, she smiled gently and continued,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Are you wondering why you don’t see any men? The men are usually at
            the mines in the Setellad Mountains.”
          </p>
          <p>
            An old man’s worried expression crossed her youthful face.
            Repenhardt turned his head away, feeling awkward. He had not
            considered that humans enslaving dwarves was a method that had come
            to mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            To prevent any potential rebellion, humans typically took dwarven
            families hostage. Men were sent to mines or construction sites for
            months, and only those who showed loyalty to humans were
            occasionally sent back to their families. With their families held
            hostage, even if the dwarves were together, they dared not easily
            start a rebellion.
          </p>
          <p>
            The unproductive children, women, and elders were gathered and
            managed in one place. This village was essentially their prison.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I’m regretting that question,’ Repenhardt shook his head and
            continued to walk. Tilla pointed to a cave along the commune,
          </p>
          <p>“That’s the temple where Priest Gelpheid resides.”</p>
          <p>
            The so-called temple was merely a cave. True to dwarven cave
            standards, the walls were straight, and there were rooms, but there
            was hardly any proper furniture. At most, there were beds, tables,
            and wardrobes, with only a token on the wall proving it to be a
            temple.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon entering the room, Gelpheid greeted him and offered Repenhardt
            a seat.
          </p>
          <p>“You seem to have recovered well, savior. That’s fortunate.”</p>

          <p>“Thanks to you, I’ve improved a lot. Thank you.”</p>
          <p>
            Due to the height difference, Repenhardt, like the dwarves, found
            that the chairs did not match his eye level when seated. Therefore,
            he declined the offered chair from Gelpheid and simply chose to sit
            casually on the floor.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And please, just call me Repenhardt. I find the title ‘Savior’ a
            bit burdensome…”
          </p>
          <p>Gelpheid nodded in understanding.</p>
          <p>
            “I can see why. You must be wondering why you, a human, have to be
            the savior of the dwarves, aren’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>“No, not exactly that I don’t know, but…”</p>
          <p>
            He couldn’t very well say he was trying again what he had failed at
            once. Repenhardt simply scratched his head without responding, as if
            Gelpheid had anticipated his silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Honestly, we too don’t understand why you are the savior. But
            looking into your eyes, we can certainly tell you don’t see us as
            slaves…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Gelpheid paused, stroking his beard. Repenhardt watched him
            silently. This elderly dwarf was trusting a prophecy, honoring a
            human as their savior, and openly discussing what could be
            considered dangerous topics.
          </p>
          <p>He asked without much thought.</p>
          <p>
            “You haven’t even asked who I am or what I do. It’s true that I
            harbor goodwill towards the dwarves, but having goodwill and saving
            the fate of an entire race are entirely different matters. Why do
            you think I would save you? Honestly, don’t you find this situation
            rather strange?”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a question that a completely unaware young man, confronted
            with this situation, could reasonably ask. What would this elderly
            dwarf, who knew nothing, respond? Repenhardt waited for Gelpheid’s
            answer with a bit of anticipation.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a moment of contemplation, Gelpheid slowly began to speak.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We do not know why Al Fort has chosen a human as the savior of our
            race either. But how can we possibly understand everything that the
            gods do? We just hold on to the hope given to us by the gods and do
            our best.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Gelpheid admitted he had been surprised when he first heard the
            prophecy. A prophecy that a human would be the savior of the dwarves
            was, logically, unbelievable. If he had been human, even deep faith
            would not have prevented his doubts and questions.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he was a dwarf. Dwarves, capable of hearing the voice of the
            earth, can instinctively distinguish between truth and lies. To
            them, lying is impossible. It wasn’t without reason that dwarves
            were known for their honesty.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a manner that could be described as plain if spoken kindly, or
            simple if not, lies the society of the dwarves. Hence, even if
            dwarves encounter concepts they cannot comprehend, they don’t fuss
            over them once they recognize these as truth. They simply accept
            them with a thought, “Ah, I see,” and move on.
          </p>
          <p>
            This characteristic is also why dwarves have primarily shone in
            practical fields. While capable of creating sturdy buildings,
            exceptional weapons, and intricate crafts with their amazing
            dexterity, they lack the ability to produce artistic structures,
            beautiful arms, or imaginary crafts that don’t exist in reality. To
            them, anything related to the arts is merely simple falsehood,
            nothing more. Though, given their technological prowess, humans
            could still marvel at the functional beauty of dwarf-made items and
            find them beautiful.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The oracle was not false, nor were the words of its messenger.
            Thus, you must be our tribe’s savior. Of course, how you’ll save us
            is unknown to both you and us. But fate works in mysterious ways,
            doesn’t it? My duty now is simply to do my best to assist you. How
            fate guides you to the path of a savior is not my concern.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Gelpheid calmly concluded his explanation. From a human perspective,
            this might seem like a form of defeatism, but when spoken with a
            dwarf’s conviction, the nuance was subtly different.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Always the same, dwarves, whether in the past or now,’ Repenhardt
            thought to himself with a chuckle. After all, if the end result was
            that the right person was saved, there wasn’t really a problem, was
            there? This mindset could make one susceptible to deceit, but that
            didn’t seem to apply to dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Gelpheid continued with a playful smile, “And if we’re to
            speak of oddities, you’re quite the anomaly yourself, young human.
            Arriving unexpectedly at a dwarf village, receiving an awkward level
            of hospitality, and then, upon hearing you’re a savior, you acted as
            though you expected as much. From an outsider’s view, your
            acceptance is rather baffling.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt felt a twinge of embarrassment as Gelpheid chuckled.
            Scratching his head, Repenhardt asked with curiosity, “Well, I
            somewhat understand. But why have you summoned me?”
          </p>
          <p>
            If Gelpheid’s words were anything to go by, their task was completed
            upon saving Repenhardt. The rest was up to fate, so there seemed to
            be no reason to call him specifically.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, of course, according to the oracle, we’ve done all we needed.
            This is about a matter unrelated to the oracle. Or perhaps, upon
            reflection, it is related?”
          </p>
          <p>“What do you mean…?”</p>
          <p>“The high priest wishes to meet you.”</p>
          <p>
            Almost involuntarily, Repenhardt almost asked, “Makelin?” He
            swallowed his words, pretending not to know, and asked, “You mean
            the High Priest?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “The High Priest of Al Fort, Lord Makelin. He is the spiritual
            pillar of all the Dwarf clans.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Hmm, so that gentleman was the High Priest even thirty years ago.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, considering Dwarves live as long as Elves, thirty years might
            only feel like seven or eight years in human terms.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, a face he longed for appeared in his mind. Makelin, who
            was always strict and old-fashioned, yet faithfully assisted him.
            Memories of him surged, and a strong desire to meet him again welled
            up.
          </p>
          <p>“I see, I must meet him then…”</p>
          <p>Gelpheid started examining Repenhardt curiously.</p>
          <p>“Why do you ask?”</p>
          <p>
            “Well, I did convey the story since I’ve heard it, but I thought it
            impossible for a human like you to understand such an abrupt story.
            I was deeply contemplating how to explain it. Humans can’t hear the
            truth like we do. Yet, you seemed to understand just by hearing the
            story. I knew it was true, but still, it’s fascinating to see it
            unfold like this.”
          </p>
          <p>“Uhm…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt let out a soft groan and closed his mouth.</p>

          <p>Indeed, he wanted to meet Makelin.</p>
          <p>
            He was resolved to build a new Antares Empire and change the world
            without fail this time. However, he lacked a clear vision. Even if
            he regained his magic, using it to forcefully create a state for
            other races like in his previous life would make no difference. He
            would end up being called a Demon King and eventually become the
            enemy of the entire continent.
          </p>
          <p>
            If he decisively crushed the continent like a true Demon King,
            unlike his past life, the Antares Empire might not fall so easily.
            If the Antares Empire could conquer the entire continent and become
            the sole empire, that could also be considered a success.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, that would mean human blood would cover the continent
            instead of other races. There’s a big difference between defending
            against invaders and being the invader, and Repenhardt did not hate
            humanity to that extent. What he wanted was a world that treats
            other races as humans, not one that treats humans as non-humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Makelin is a wise Dwarf; discussing with him might reveal some
            solution.’
          </p>
          <p>
            In his previous life, it was almost Makelin who had actually founded
            the Antares Empire. Among the various races, only the dwarves
            maintained a society, and it was Makelin, the High Priest of Al
            Fort, who spiritually led all those dwarves. The words of someone
            with such knowledge and wisdom were certainly worth listening to.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If it’s Makelin of this era, he would be at the Grand Forge,
            located at the northernmost part of the Setellad mountain range. It
            shouldn’t be too far.’
          </p>
          <p>
            When Repenhardt readily agreed, Gelpheid also became excited. He
            continued in an energetic voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Lord Makelin is at the Grand Forge, the grand temple of Al Fort. Of
            course, its location is highly confidential, known only to a very
            few among the dwarves. Thus, I’ll assign you a guide. He’s the only
            remaining warrior of our kin who can hold his own even against the
            average human knight.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ugh, I can’t exactly say now that I already know the location.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Though he knew the location and didn’t need a guide, Repenhardt
            couldn’t think of an excuse to decline. Having a guide for visiting
            the dwarves wouldn’t be a loss anyway. He was also grateful for
            their thorough care.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt simply accepted and expressed his gratitude honestly.
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you.”</p>
          <p>
            “What thanks? It’s something we’re doing for the sake of our
            dwarves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Gelpheid waved his hand in modesty. No, on second thought, it didn’t
            seem like modesty at all. Wasn’t it indeed for the sake of the
            dwarves?
          </p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt was smiling bitterly, Gelpheid suddenly changed his
            expression and grew serious.
          </p>
          <p>“By the way, Savior sir.”</p>
          <p>“Yes?”</p>
          <p>
            “The truth is, I know. That you haven’t told us only the truth.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt stiffened his expression in a moment of realization. Upon
            reflection, dwarves have an instinctive ability to hear the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m not sure, but it seems to me that you know quite a lot about
            us. You even know about the High Priest, and even the location of
            the Grand Forge, I could hear it in your heart.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Caught off guard, Repenhardt was momentarily flustered. Gelpheid
            then relaxed his expression and smiled warmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “However, the sound of your heart thinking about us was also true.
            That’s why I don’t doubt you. I understand you might be hiding
            something, but humans are different from us, habitually hiding the
            truth, so it’s not something I can’t understand.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, yes…”</p>
          <p>Lost for words, Repenhardt could only offer an awkward smile.</p>
