          <p>[ Chapter 41 ]</p>
          <p>
            Romad swallowed hard, convinced that what was deemed advantageous
            for them would certainly not bode well for him and his group. The
            sight of Lantas’s body, severed at the torso, only cemented this
            belief further.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Romad and his party stealthily approached Repenhardt, their
            complexions could have given zombies or ghouls a run for their
            money, seemingly more suited for a face-off in pallor than to any
            lively encounter. Even pigs headed to the slaughterhouse seemed
            cheerier in comparison.
          </p>
          <p>“Who are you?”</p>
          <p>“Excuse me?”</p>
          <p>
            Romad responded, visibly confused. A dense aura of murderous intent
            emanated from Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“Who sent you?”</p>
          <p>
            No answer came forth. Romad’s group did not possess the mental
            fortitude to withstand Repenhardt’s imposing aura. They were
            evidently as fearful of Teriq as they were of facing Repenhardt’s
            wrath. Mentioning Teriq’s name was equivalent to sealing their fate,
            a fact they were all too aware of.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their misfortune lay in not knowing that omitting Teriq’s name would
            lead to an equally grim outcome.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s smile grew wider.</p>
          <p>
            “I figured it wouldn’t be easy to get you to talk. I thought as
            much.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Walking over to a nearby fallen branch, Repenhardt picked it up.
            Holding the stick, he generously offered:
          </p>
          <p>“I shall show mercy on you.”</p>
          <p>
            Why wield a stick if mercy was to be granted? The question hung in
            the air as everyone frowned in unjust treatment, yet Repenhardt
            stood unashamed, looking up at the sky without a hint of
            embarrassment.
          </p>
          <p>“Still, you’re just underlings, so I won’t kill you.”</p>
          <p>
            He beat them precisely as much as he deemed fit, not a stroke more,
            not a stroke less.
          </p>
          <p>A minute later, he asked again.</p>
          <p>“Who hired you?”</p>
          <p>
            They were incapable of standing due to their shattered bones, yet
            their ability to speak remained untouched—a testament to the
            mysterious efficacy of this particular method of physical
            persuasion.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s, it’s Teriq, sir!”</p>
          <p>“He’s the current head of the Rolpein Trading Company!”</p>
          <p>
            “His residence is a mansion on the outskirts south of Zeppelin.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “To get there, head south through the southern gate and continue for
            about 10 minutes until you reach a triangular crossroad, then take
            the left!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The response was immediate. Indeed, Gym Unbreakable’s method of
            physical training proved to be an exceptional form of interrogation.
            What took mere ‘morning practice’ had them spilling every detail
            without the need for an ‘afternoon session.’
          </p>
          <p>“Teriq?”</p>
          <p>
            The name rang a bell. It was unmistakably the name of the
            middle-aged man who had tormented Siris for a decade in his past
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Repenhardt had rescued Siris, he had intended to kill Teriq
            first and foremost. Even back then, Repenhardt was of archmage
            caliber, more than capable of exacting revenge on Teriq.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, it was all in vain, as Teriq had already died from fatty
            liver disease compounded with diabetes by the time they arrived. It
            was said that he died of peritonitis on a ship carrying elf slaves.
            The anger and emptiness felt at that time were still vivid.
          </p>
          <p>“Was it that bastard!”</p>
          <p>
            The resentment from his past life overlapped with his current anger.
            Repenhardt’s eyes fiercely ignited. Romad, startled by this
            reaction, asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Are you seriously thinking of going after them?”</p>
          <p>
            He thought mentioning the Rolpein Trading Company’s name would calm
            the young man down, even if he was a powerful aura wielder. Thus, he
            had hoped that by mentioning Teriq’s name, it might somehow resolve
            the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            But his reaction seemed not only unresolved, but also intent on
            heading to the mansion!
          </p>
          <p>“It’s impossible! Even you…”</p>
          <p>
            He was about to say that the mansion had an aura wielder as a
            knight! But then he remembered that the mansion’s knight was none
            other than Lantas, who was now in ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Romad was taken aback. It seemed unlikely that this brutish monster
            would suffer any harm from raiding the mansion. Knowing how
            formidable an aura wielder’s power could be from seeing Lantas, he
            understood that storming Teriq’s mansion and taking his head would
            not be difficult, given the mansion’s usual level of vigilance.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, he couldn’t just let Teriq die like that. Losing a job at
            this age would make it difficult to find another, especially for
            someone who had been living by the sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Lord Teriq owns the second-largest trading company within the
            Chatan Principality! If anything were to happen to him, it would be
            a public disaster for the Chatan Principality!”
          </p>
          <p>His warning fell on deaf ears.</p>
          <p>“Yeah, I know all about it.”</p>
          <p>Grinding his teeth, Repenhardt muttered.</p>
          <p>“I know exactly what kind of person he is.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt discarded the stick. Then, looking down at Romad and his
            companions, who couldn’t even get up due to the ‘beatdown training’
            and were just gasping like fishes, he said,
          </p>
          <p>“I won’t kill you, as promised.”</p>
          <p>Romad wore a look of despair.</p>
          <p>“Uuuuugh…”</p>
          <p>
            Even the mighty Repenhardt couldn’t move for a while after being
            beaten up like that. Leaving them out in this winter cold? They
            would freeze to death without the strength to crawl.
          </p>
          <p>Curses flowed involuntarily.</p>
          <p>‘Just kill me quickly, you bastard!’</p>
          <p>
            But he was too scared to say it out loud. And that saved Romad and
            his companions. Repenhardt truly intended to keep his promise not to
            kill them. So, he picked up the fallen men and neatly bundled them
            up.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Come on, you lot, huddle together for warmth. That way, you won’t
            freeze to death.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was an act of cruelty or mercy; the line was blurry. With Siris
            and Sillan in tow, Repenhardt left the open ground. As they moved
            away, an almost unbearable scene began to unfold behind the
            departing party.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, don’t squeeze in! It hurts!”</p>
          <p>“Don’t press there! That’s where the bone is broken!”</p>
          <p>“Is there a place that isn’t broken!”</p>

          <p>“Lord Romad, unexpectedly, you have a warm heart.”</p>
          <p>“Quiet! You brat! Don’t make me blush! Shut it!”</p>
          <p>
            Huddled together like worms in a fisherman’s bait box, the pitiful
            Romad and his group struggled to keep alive against the winter
            chill. It was indeed a self-inflicted predicament.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Zeppelin’s western outskirts, at the Rolpein Mansion.</p>
          <p>
            In a large bedroom strewn with gold-threaded bedding, two young
            elves stood shivering in the nude. They were just over forty,
            equivalent to about ten-year-old human children. These young
            children were being lasciviously toyed with by two adult elf women.
          </p>
          <p>
            From one side of the bedroom, Teriq and Beret sipped their drinks,
            enjoying the lewd spectacle. Both were dressed only in thin silk
            robes over their naked bodies. Suddenly, Beret asked,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Why did you buy such young elves? They’re too young to be of any
            use, aren’t they?”
          </p>
          <p>
            While asking, Beret gestured, and another elf slave quickly fed him
            a grape. Teriq took a sip of his drink and smirked.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s fine. It’s Sir Lantas’s salary, after all.”</p>
          <p>
            “Huh? You mean we can dip into someone else’s salary like that?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sir Lantas doesn’t care if they’re virgins or not, as long as
            they’re young. He won’t say anything even if we play with them a bit
            and then hand them off.”
          </p>
          <p>“Huh! What a pervert.”</p>
          <p>
            Beret genuinely criticized Lantas’s perversion while being in the
            midst of such debauchery himself. Amazingly, Teriq sincerely agreed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Exactly. What a perverted old man. I mean, what’s the fun in
            defiling young ones who aren’t even virgins?”
          </p>
          <p>“Exactly. He doesn’t know the first thing about refinement.”</p>
          <p>
            As if to prove they were cut from the same cloth, both men shared
            the same thoughts. The saying ‘birds of a feather flock together’
            didn’t come from nowhere. Both were firmly convinced that their
            current actions were far removed from perverted sexual desires.
            Their belief was as strong as a high priest’s faith, truly beyond
            redemption.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there was no one at the scene to condemn those two.
            Suddenly, amidst enjoying the debauched feast, Beret tilted his head
            in confusion.
          </p>
          <p>“By the way, when is that returned elf female coming?”</p>
          <p>Teriq grimaced and replied.</p>
          <p>“Exactly. Why is she so late, what is Romad doing?”</p>
          <p>
            Currently, Teriq had specially invited Beret to boast about his
            ability to tame an elf slave. Beret had gladly accepted the
            invitation, eager to see Teriq suffer the same humiliation he had
            experienced. One might wonder what kind of friendship this was, but
            to the wealthy of the Chatan Principality, this was considered quite
            a close relationship.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm, should we try tasting this in the meantime?”</p>
          <p>
            Growing tired of waiting, Beret approached a young elf child after
            taking off his robe. Despite being in front of Teriq, he unabashedly
            revealed his naked body. However, neither of them showed a hint of
            shame. The child screamed in terror.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Shivering, the child looked desperately at the ‘adults’ for
            salvation. However, the other elves deliberately ignored the child’s
            gaze. This was a despicable situation of attempting to rape a child
            who didn’t even look ten years old, but there was nothing they could
            do.
          </p>
          <p>In the midst of it all, Beret suddenly perked up his ears.</p>

          <p>“It seems somewhat noisy outside, doesn’t it?”</p>
          <p>
            True to its luxurious nature, the bedroom was equipped with perfect
            soundproofing. Teriq had spared no effort to ensure that their
            activities were not interrupted by noise. As such, Beret could only
            faintly recognize some sounds.
          </p>
          <p>Teriq lifted his glass as if it was nothing.</p>
          <p>
            “What, as if the people downstairs haven’t caused a commotion
            before?”
          </p>
          <p>“Indeed, haha.”</p>
          <p>
            Ignoring it, Beret looked back down at the elf child. A look of
            terror had surfaced on the child’s face.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Three robust men wielding swords and shields dashed down the hallway
            with fearsome expressions.
          </p>
          <p>“Uaaaaaaah!”</p>
          <p>Their shouts turned into screams as they were flung backward.</p>
          <p>“Aaaagh!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt twirled the spear in his hand and clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>“Really, it’s harder not to kill them.”</p>
          <p>
            After effortlessly knocking down the three guards who had attacked,
            Repenhardt looked around. As befitted the residence of the
            second-ranking trading company of the Chatan Principality, the
            Rolpein mansion was extraordinarily spacious. It was the sort that
            could easily cause anyone to lose their way inside.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt navigated through the mansion as if he had lived
            there all his life.
          </p>
          <p>“This way leads to the stairs going up to the third floor.”</p>
          <p>
            He had once lived in the imperial palace of the Antares Empire, a
            place so vast that this mansion, no matter its size, seemed like
            nothing more than a lavatory in comparison. The structure of a
            noble’s mansion was so predictable that having seen the exterior, he
            had already grasped most of its layout.
          </p>
          <p>“Now, Sillan. I’m counting on you.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, yes.”</p>
          <p>Sillan approached the felled guards and prayed.</p>
          <p>
            “O Philanence, watch over your young servants and erase their
            painful memories.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A divine power flickered above the heads of the fallen guards and
            then vanished. With that, they would remember nothing of today’s
            intruder.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, it was a divine spell used to blur the memories of a
            spurned lover, but with Sillan’s tremendous divine power, it could
            also be used for memory erasure. After all, they were ‘painful’
            memories.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt admired Sillan’s work with a word of praise.</p>
          <p>“That’s convenient.”</p>
          <p>
            Manipulating the mind belonged to the realm of high-level magic, and
            Repenhardt, in his current state, knew the theory but lacked the
            power to cast such spells. Sillan shrugged.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It doesn’t work for offensive purposes. It only works on those who
            are unconscious. But, if I weren’t here, what were you planning to
            do about the witnesses?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Even with Repenhardt’s aura abilities, there was no guarantee he
            would escape unscathed after killing the master of the Rolpein
            Trading Company. Of course, killing all the witnesses was an option,
            but the Repenhardt that Sillan knew wasn’t the type to go that far.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt smiled faintly.</p>
          <p>“The plan was to sneak in and take only Teriq’s head.”</p>
          <p>
            “Then it’s fortunate that I can use memory-erasing magic. I
            definitely want to see that bastard get what he deserves!”
          </p>
          <p>Sillan gritted his teeth.</p>
          <p>
            When Repenhardt was on the verge of rushing to the Rolpein mansion
            to beat Teriq to death, Sillan didn’t try to stop him. There was no
            reason to; Sillan had nearly been a victim too. It didn’t matter
            whether it was a man or a woman; no one would graciously forgive
            someone trying to implant something strange into their body without
            permission. Far from stopping him, Sillan eagerly egged him on.

          <p>[ Chapter 42 ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt and his companions rushed straight to the Rolpein Mansion
            on the outskirts of Zeppelin. Upon arriving at the mansion, they
            immediately scaled the wall and made a frontal assault through the
            main entrance, knocking down any obstacles in their path as they
            advanced. Indeed, the mansion’s security was no ordinary matter, but
            it was woefully inadequate to block the path of aura wielders. They
            penetrated so quickly that the guards had no chance to alert Teriq
            of the intrusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they ascended to the third floor, a long, spacious corridor came
            into view. There were no guards. It was uncommon for patrols to
            reach up to the third floor. Repenhardt sensed Teriq’s presence
            through his senses. True enough, in one of the bedrooms on the third
            floor, multiple presences could be felt. Despite the chaos, their
            emotional state seemed quite peaceful.
          </p>
          <p>
            “After all, it took less than five minutes to climb over the wall
            and get here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The situation would require someone to go and alert the others, but
            Repenhardt and his party had arrived faster than anyone could be
            sent to give warning. Repenhardt smiled wryly as he walked down the
            corridor. At that moment, a massive shadow appeared in front of the
            corridor.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the Orc Gladiator, Talkata. Excluding the unruly Lantas, he
            was the strongest warrior in the mansion, naturally tasked with
            directly guarding Teriq.
          </p>
          <p>Drawing his sword and shield, Talkata growled.</p>
          <p>“Talkata stops intruding humans!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt made a slightly troubled expression. It was easy enough
            to knock out the human guards with a few blows, but dealing with an
            Orc Gladiator was a different matter. A club wouldn’t suffice; he
            had to use fists, but there was no guarantee he could subdue him
            without killing.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt suddenly changed his tone and spoke in Orcish.</p>
          <p>
            “O being of warrior blood, the one you guard is unworthy of your
            protection. Why do you draw your sword for him?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Surprised to hear Orcish from a human, Talkata’s eyes widened.
            However, he quickly regained his composure. Gripping his sword
            tightly, Talkata responded in Orcish.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am a warrior, bound by duty. If I were to bend to the whims of
            the era, how could I call myself a warrior?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “To live as a slave, is that your will? This man is not your
            mentor.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even if he is not my mentor, the duty given to me is clear.
            Fulfilling my duty is the warrior’s way.”
          </p>
          <p>“Even if that duty is forced upon you?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            A sense of warrior’s pride filled Talkata’s rugged, scarred face.
          </p>
          <p>
            “O mighty human warrior. My soul already recognizes the greatness of
            your strength.”
          </p>
          <p>He aimed his sword at Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>“Break my sword, human. Then, you shall achieve your purpose.”</p>
          <p>
            Talkata adopted an unwavering combat stance. Repenhardt clicked his
            tongue in response.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, an orc remains an orc after all.”</p>
          <p>
            A sword’s duty is never forsaken, even if that duty is misguided.
            Such is the pride of an orc warrior. Repenhardt, having fully
            experienced such ironclad promises in his previous life, had
            attempted to engage in dialogue, though internally he doubted it
            would be effective.
          </p>

          <p>‘Ah, these simple-minded brutes…’</p>
          <p>
            They had been reliable allies once, but now they were just a
            headache.
          </p>
          <p>“Can I subdue him without killing?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt stepped forward, filled with internal unease. Behind him,
            Sillan murmured with a blank expression.
          </p>
          <p>“Mr. Repenhardt, you can speak Orcish?”</p>
          <p>
            Even Sillan could tell the growling sounds were in Orcish, having
            seen orc slaves communicate in such a manner. However, humans fluent
            in Orcish were extremely rare, usually limited to slave trainers who
            knew a few basic commands at best. Yet, Repenhardt growled as
            naturally as if he were an orc himself.
          </p>
          <p>Siris murmured with a complicated expression.</p>
          <p>“To think he knows Orcish…”</p>
          <p>
            The identity of their enormous companion became even more
            mysterious. Just when she thought he was merely a pervert, it turns
            out he was an aura user, and on top of that, he spoke Orcish with a
            native accent.
          </p>
          <p>‘…Such a curious person…’</p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt raised his fist and began to approach Talkata, Siris
            felt disturbed. Until now, she had only followed Repenhardt without
            actively participating in fights. There was no need to wield a sword
            without a direct command.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, things were different. She felt a strong impulse to join
            Repenhardt in battle.
          </p>
          <p>It was perplexing.</p>
          <p>‘Why am I thinking this?’</p>
          <p>
            She couldn’t understand why such feelings were emerging. Her mind
            was a whirl of confusion. Naturally, as a Slayer, wanting to wield a
            sword to charm her master was expected. However, Siris harbored
            hatred towards the humans who had made her a Slayer, a slave. There
            couldn’t be such a reason for these feelings.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, she found herself calling out his name unintentionally.</p>
          <p>“Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>“Hm? Why do you call, Siris?”</p>
          <p>
            His affectionate response stirred something within her. Struggling
            to maintain her composure, she gripped her sword.
          </p>
          <p>“I will handle this one.”</p>
          <p>Sillan asked in surprise.</p>
          <p>“Huh? Are you sure, Siris?”</p>
          <p>“This time, the weapon is different.”</p>
          <p>
            Responding confidently, Siris drew her long sword, a weapon
            previously wielded by Lantas. It was different from the shattered
            scimitar she had bought, but being of the same category of long
            swords, she was confident in this domain. Moreover, as a weapon used
            by an aura wielder, it was a high-quality item made of a mithril and
            adamantium alloy, enchanted with magic to maintain its sharpness at
            all times, so there was no exaggeration in saying that there were no
            disadvantages due to the weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, Talkata seemed to notice the change in Siris as his
            expression hardened. The aura she emitted with the sword was
            different from when she merely held a dagger.
          </p>

          <p>“Weak elf, you’ve grown stronger.”</p>
          <p>
            Talkata, having switched back to human language, looked at Siris
            seriously. As Siris faced him with her sword, she muttered to
            herself.
          </p>
          <p>‘Yes, I haven’t settled the score with this one.’</p>
          <p>
            She felt she understood why such a sentiment arose. As a swordsman,
            being preoccupied with victory is not unnatural, is it?
          </p>
          <p>
            She found a convincing reason. Siris’s expression brightened
            considerably. A sharp, blade-like aura emanated from her entire
            body.
          </p>
          <p>“Then do as you wish, Siris.”</p>
          <p>
            Though taken aback, Repenhardt readily stepped back. While he was
            concerned, he intended to respect Siris’s wishes. She was a
            swordsman, not an object to be coddled and protected within his
            arms.
          </p>
          <p>Of course, he did not forget to whisper to Sillan in secret.</p>
          <p>
            “Sillan, watch her back. If it seems dangerous… you know what to
            do.”
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t worry. That’s my specialty.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris and Talkata slowly closed the distance between them. The elf
            Slayer and the orc gladiator searched for each other’s weaknesses,
            their sharp blades flashing. Repenhardt quietly watched the standoff
            before suddenly walking down the corridor. Talkata glared.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Strong human! Are you ignoring my battle? Are you planning to
            target Lord Teriq?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt calmly responded in Orcish.</p>
          <p>
            “Your adversary should be the elf maiden before you. To be concerned
            with me is not showing proper respect to your adversary, is it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Talkata, flustered, turned his gaze back to Siris. Repenhardt’s
            words were perfectly aligned with the warrior’s code. The elf before
            him was undeniably a strong opponent that deserved a fight with all
            his might. To be distracted was a grave insult to a strong opponent!
          </p>
          <p>“You are right.”</p>
          <p>
            Talkata shifted his attention away from Repenhardt and began to
            solely focus on Siris again. Repenhardt shook his head in
            disapproval.
          </p>
          <p>‘That’s orcs for you.’</p>
          <p>
            The teachings of orc warriors prioritize combat with the strong over
            the protection of the weak.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘That’s why they’re quite useful as warriors but absolutely
            disqualified as guards.’
          </p>
          <p>
            So, in his previous life as well, the escort troops mainly consisted
            of dwarves, while the orcs were deployed like assault or special
            forces units. He passed by Talkata and grabbed the doorknob. At that
            moment, the sharp yell of Siris echoed from behind.
          </p>
          <p>“Haap!”</p>
          <p>Talkata, too, let out a warrior’s roar as he charged forward.</p>
          <p>“Kwoooo!”</p>
          <p>
            A fierce clash erupted, sounding the cry of steel. Leaving the fight
            behind, Repenhardt opened the door.
          </p>

          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Upon opening the door, hell unfolded before his eyes.</p>
          <p>
            Amidst the noxious fumes of drugs, a young man, too shameful to be
            called a boy, was atop a young elf, moving his hips. Next to him, a
            fat youth, with his gown loosely undone, exposed himself while
            receiving caresses from other elves.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s voice involuntarily turned icy.</p>
          <p>
            “I’ve seen many a vile sight in my life… but this would easily rank
            in the top three worst.”
          </p>
          <p>Only then did Beret turn his head with a dazed expression.</p>
          <p>“Huh? What’s that?”</p>
          <p>
            Even in this situation, those two hadn’t grasped the atmosphere.
            Repenhardt moved without a word. A large youth, looking formidable,
            stared at them with a menacing gaze as he approached. Realizing the
            situation, Teriq and Beret began to panic.
          </p>
          <p>“Who, who are you!”</p>
          <p>“Look here! Is there nobody around!”</p>
          <p>
            Both were screaming, their genitals flapping about. Repenhardt
            scanned the room. At the feet of the two, a young child gasped for
            air, bleeding from the groin and collapsed on the floor. In a corner
            of the room, there was also the body of another child, already dead
            and beginning to stiffen post-mortem.
          </p>
          <p>A sigh escaped him.</p>
          <p>
            “Huh, why are there so many that should not be allowed to live in
            this world…”
          </p>
          <p>
            A dense murderous aura filled the room. Merely with that aura, the
            mentally sensitive elf slaves fainted one after another. Fear filled
            the faces of Teriq and Beret. When had these well-bred individuals
            ever faced such murderous intent? They trembled as if they had
            fallen into the midst of hell, their bodies shaking like aspen
            trees.
          </p>
          <p>“Talkata! Where are you, Talkata!”</p>
          <p>
            Of course, that Talkata couldn’t hear anything as he was fighting
            with Siris. Teriq gritted his teeth and looked up at Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What happened here! How come there was no alarm when an intruder
            came all the way here!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Repenhardt easily demolished it, it wasn’t to say that the
            security at the Rolpein mansion was weak. After all, a person who
            has committed many crimes in life wouldn’t be careless about their
            own safety.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teriq had spent a large sum of money to hire as many as fifty guards
            and even stationed expensive orc gladiators, while also thoroughly
            setting up various magical defenses around the mansion. This should
            have been enough to hold off a considerable army, or at least give
            him enough leeway to escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Unless it’s an Aura user, it shouldn’t be this easy to break
            through!’
          </p>
          <p>
            Teriq didn’t know that his fleeting thought was the truth. No matter
            how much he fortified the defenses, he hadn’t prepared for an
            invasion by an Aura user. He wasn’t the king of some country, and he
            thought that those rare, proud, and arrogant Aura users would never
            personally come to capture him. And indeed, that was the common
            sense of this era.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how unbelievable it was, the intruder in front of him was
            a reality. Trembling with fear, Teriq suddenly shouted with a
            glimmer of hope.
          </p>
          <p>“What do you want? Money?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt did not answer. Teriq, as if realizing something, shouted
            again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Then is it the market rights? Damn it! It must be the work of the
            Taoban Trading Company!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, there was no response. Confident in his guess, Teriq slightly
            relaxed and spoke.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I see. Listen, how much were you paid? I’ll pay double that. It’s a
            merchant’s promise. I swear on the name of Rolpein. I can write a
            certificate right here and now. Or do you want gold? I promise on
            the name of Rolpein that there will be no retaliation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Teriq continued to sell the name of Rolpein, constantly asserting
            that he was the owner of the second-largest trading company in the
            principality. Subtly, he implied that if anything happened to him,
            the Rolpein Trading Company would seek revenge.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the intruder’s expression did not change at all. Not even
            the slightest disturbance was seen at the mention of Rolpein’s name.
          </p>
          <p>“Truly, you haven’t changed at all.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 43 ]</p>
          <p>“Truly, you haven’t changed at all.”</p>
          <p>
            Looking down at Teriq, Repenhardt murmured in a voice filled with
            emotion.
          </p>
          <p>‘Nothing has changed at all….’</p>
          <p>
            In his past life, this man was the same. He enjoyed buying all sorts
            of elves and human women, torturing, raping, and killing them,
            taking pleasure in their pain-filled expressions. And when any issue
            arose, he would simply resolve everything with money.
          </p>
          <p>‘Siris was under this vile monster for a decade….’</p>
          <p>
            The image of her, having endured all sorts of torture and violation,
            half-mad with agony, arose in his mind, igniting a furious blaze of
            anger within. Repenhardt lightly clenched his fist.
          </p>
          <p>“I missed my chance back then.”</p>
          <p>
            That simple action made Teriq instinctively step backward. Murderous
            intent and hostility leaked from every movement. Even the
            slow-witted Teriq could distinctly feel the terrifying murderous
            aura.
          </p>
          <p>‘Who is this? Do I know him from before?’</p>
          <p>
            His tone seemed to suggest that he recognized him. Teriq racked his
            brain hard. Having lived a life full of hateful deeds, he couldn’t
            guess at all.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt kicked Teriq in the abdomen.</p>
          <p>Thud!</p>
          <p>“Guuaaagh!”</p>
          <p>
            Honestly, it was more of a light touch than a kick. A real kick
            would have killed him on the spot. Yet, even that was enough for
            Teriq to scream, bend over and begin to vomit everything he had
            drunk.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh! Uweeek!”</p>
          <p>
            He continued to vomit, his pathetic, tear-streaked face twisted in
            pain and fear.
          </p>
          <p>“… Why, why are you doing this to me….”</p>
          <p>
            He truly felt wronged. Why should someone as wealthy and powerful as
            him ‘unluckily’ endure such an ordeal! Seeing him like this only
            boiled Repenhardt’s blood more. Repenhardt raised his hand.
          </p>
          <p>“This scum touched Siris with these hands….”</p>
          <p>
            He grabbed Teriq’s hair, pulling him up. Teriq screamed as his hair
            was pulled out, but Repenhardt was unfazed. He looked down at
            Teriq’s hands. His eyes reddened with rage.
          </p>
          <p>“You defiled Siris with these hands….”</p>
          <p>
            In an instant, Teriq’s hands were severed from his body, spraying
            blood. Repenhardt had cut them off with his hand blade. A scream of
            agony burst forth.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaaagh!”</p>

          <p>
            With bloodshot eyes, Teriq screamed and screamed. His ample flesh
            trembled with pain. But Repenhardt did not stop.
          </p>
          <p>“You kicked Siris with these legs?”</p>
          <p>His legs were severed next. Teriq gasped and sobbed in pain.</p>
          <p>“Ahuhuhuhu….”</p>
          <p>
            The mutilated, obese body of Teriq looked like that of a pig. His
            genitals hung limp between his legs, shriveled in terror.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t even want to mention what filthy acts you’ve committed with
            that disgusting thing,” Repenhardt said, snapping his fingers in
            disgust. He found it repulsive to even touch such a vile object. So,
            he fired a small orb of aura, blasting it away entirely.
          </p>
          <p>“AAAAAAAH!”</p>
          <p>
            Blood, screams, and cries gushed out like a fountain, soaking the
            bedding and ceiling. Teriq muttered in a dying voice, “Who… is
            Siris… exactly…”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was unjust. All this time, he had been accused of defiling Siris,
            yet he didn’t even know who Siris was. To be fair, it was true that
            Teriq hadn’t laid a finger on Siris, not having met her yet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smirked at this realization, “I suppose this must feel
            terribly unfair to you now.”
          </p>
          <p>
            To make someone a severe cripple and then comment on the injustice
            of it? Teriq trembled in shock, unbelievably still alive despite his
            body being nothing but fat. Repenhardt looked down at him with a
            cold laugh, “Now you might understand how those who died unjustly
            felt.”
          </p>
          <p>“Uuuuuugh…”</p>
          <p>
            The light faded from Teriq’s eyes as he drew his last breath. Beret,
            who stood by, gasped in horror, “You, you killed him? You’re a
            murderer!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Beret, who had panicked, had himself slaughtered an innocent elf
            girl and was now accusing someone of murder. Repenhardt shook his
            head, “Funny, aren’t you also a murderer then?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I have lived my life looking up to the sky without shame!” Beret
            exclaimed, as if what he said made any sense. Repenhardt snorted at
            this, “Well, it seems you’ve lived without shame, alright.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing him proclaim such nonsense while his genitals dangled,
            indeed, he seemed to lack any sense of shame. Then, Siris and Sillan
            entered the room. Siris saw the dismembered corpse of Teriq and
            murmured in shock, “This is… cruel.”
          </p>
          <p>
            To Repenhardt, Teriq was an archenemy, but to Siris, he was just a
            stranger. It made sense for her to find the sight cruel. Repenhardt
            responded, “He deserved even worse than this.”
          </p>
          <p>Sillan shrugged, “On that note, I completely agree.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite the gruesome scene, Sillan didn’t seem perturbed. He was
            quite accustomed to brutal sights. Repenhardt asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Talkata?”</p>
          <p>
            “Oh, Siris took him down. She was incredibly strong, you know? I
            didn’t even have a chance to step in.”
          </p>
          <p>Siris modestly shook her head in denial.</p>
          <p>
            “He was strong. If Sillan hadn’t used his healing magic on me, I
            wouldn’t have been standing here like this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Extending his senses, he could feel the presence of Talkata,
            collapsed in the corridor. He appeared to be breathing faintly,
            suggesting he wasn’t dead. Siris, too, seemed to have sustained
            considerable injuries, given her torn clothes. Thanks to Sillan’s
            healing, only her white flesh was visible through the tears in her
            garment now.
          </p>
          <p>
            To think she managed to defeat a veteran orc gladiator in a
            one-on-one battle? Repenhardt was slightly surprised.
          </p>

          <p>‘Siris is quite strong at this time?’</p>
          <p>
            Somehow, she seemed stronger now than when he first met her in his
            previous life. Back then, she had been abused for 10 years as a mere
            castle decoration, which likely led to a decline in her abilities.
          </p>
          <p>Beret recognized Siris and screamed.</p>
          <p>“You’re that slayer from back then!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris was looking at the cold, lifeless body of a young elf tossed
            in a corner. Another child, close to dying, was already receiving
            Sillan’s healing magic.
          </p>
          <p>Siris glared at him, her ‘former master’.</p>
          <p>“Did you kill this child?”</p>
          <p>
            If Beret had any sense of the situation, he might have tried to
            blame the dead Teriq. However, he had never felt the need to lie to
            mere elf slaves in his life. So, he carelessly answered.
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, but why?”</p>
          <p>
            He couldn’t even think of lying because he felt no guilt. Siris drew
            her sword. Seeing the dead child revived memories of her childhood,
            of her dying village and the children of her clan.
          </p>
          <p>“This life may be too cheap to appease the soul of that child…”</p>
          <p>
            Beret’s face, frozen in terror, reflected off the chilling blade.
          </p>
          <p>“But this is the least I can do.”</p>
          <p>
            Only then did Beret glare at Repenhardt, thinking this situation was
            orchestrated by him. He couldn’t believe an elf would have the will
            to act on their own.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What? You’re going to kill me over some elf slave? That’s
            ridiculous… Gurgh!”
          </p>
          <p>The sharp blade pierced deeply into Beret’s shoulder.</p>
          <p>“Ah! Ah! Aaah!”</p>
          <p>It hurt. It hurt so much that tears came to his eyes.</p>
          <p>
            “How, just because I killed some elves, you’re going to kill a man?
            What kind of sense does that make?”
          </p>
          <p>
            He truly didn’t understand why this was happening to him. Siris
            swung her sword again, severing his right arm partially and spraying
            blood. Beret screamed again, beginning to beg.
          </p>
          <p>“Please… spare me… spare my life…”</p>
          <p>
            Despite having come this far, Beret was still only looking at
            Repenhardt. Unable to bear it any longer, Repenhardt opened his
            mouth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do you really think you can beg for your life after piling up such
            sins? Did you think you wouldn’t be punished after all you’ve done?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Talos, the god of death and misfortune who judges human sins,
            Repenhardt looked down on him with dignity. The coldness in his gaze
            made Beret realize that he had no chance of leaving this place
            alive.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Beret was consumed by anger. He shouted furiously.</p>

          <p>“And what about you? What right do you have to judge me!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smirked. When it comes down to it, he could be considered
            among the top five murderers of all time. Even if a whole unit of
            murderers were gathered, they wouldn’t come close to half the number
            of people he had killed. So, compared to Beret, who had killed just
            a few elves, Repenhardt might be considered a greater villain.
          </p>
          <p>Yes, he admitted that. So, what?</p>
          <p>“The right to judge?”</p>
          <p>Twisting his lips, Repenhardt gave a bizarre smile.</p>
          <p>
            “Do you have to be spotless to have the right to clean up trash?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Beret’s face turned pale. Repenhardt declared like a god passing
            judgment.
          </p>
          <p>“What right is needed to dispose of trash like you?”</p>
          <p>
            At the same moment, Siris extended her arm. The cold blade of a long
            sword deeply penetrated Beret’s heart.
          </p>
          <p>“K-keugh! Save me…….”</p>
          <p>
            Beret’s body, his breath cut off, fell over the dead body of a young
            elf. Just before he fell, Siris kicked Beret. She whispered softly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even in death…… I can’t let a bastard like you touch this child…….”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The forest behind the Rolpein estate was covered in snow. The sky
            was clear, and the moon shone brightly, reflecting off the snow and
            illuminating the surroundings despite the deep night.
          </p>
          <p>
            A group of shadows was visible there, comprised of elves and orcs.
            At the front of the group stood the orc gladiator Talkata. He had
            been severely wounded by Siris, but now he was completely healed
            thanks to Sillan’s healing magic. Talkata indicated towards the
            group and said,
          </p>
          <p>“These are all of them.”</p>
          <p>Siris bowed lightly in gratitude.</p>
          <p>“Thank you, Talkata.”</p>
          <p>
            “No thanks are needed. The sword of Talkata has been broken. Now,
            your master is my master.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Talkata waved his hand, indicating that gratitude was unnecessary.
          </p>
          <p>
            The elf girl before him was the strong warrior who had defeated him.
            And Repenhardt was the master of that Siris. Having served Teriq who
            was killed by Repenhardt, and having been defeated by Repenhardt’s
            slave, it was natural for Talkata to acknowledge Repenhardt as his
            new master. Perhaps it was a strange mix of an orc warrior’s
            instinct and the brainwashing education of slavery?
          </p>
          <p>
            Regardless, he seemed to like this situation. Honestly, Teriq was
            never worthy of being served as a master.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Seventeen female elves, nine male orcs. That’s all the slaves in
            the mansion.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Talkata continued, indicating the slaves. The gender ratio was
            significantly biased. Originally, male elves and female orcs were
            not much in demand as merchandise. Typically, they were only bred in
            slave breeding farms for propagation or offspring production, and it
            was rare to use them as slaves. These beings who walked on two legs,
            spoke, and had intellect and emotions were treated by humans as if
            they were just breeding horses or laying hens.
          </p>
          <p>“Talkata did as ordered.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had ordered Talkata to bring out all the slaves from the
            mansion. That’s why he had gone around the mansion to bring all the
            slaves to this place.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was common for humans to fight disputes and take away each
            other’s property. The mansion was already in chaos, and most of the
            guards had fallen, so the slaves were somewhat expecting that they
            would have a new master. That’s why they all obediently followed
            what Talkata had told them to do.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan murmured as he looked at the gathered slaves.</p>
          <p>“What exactly is Mr. Repen doing?”</p>
          <p>
            After taking Siris and Sillan out of the mansion, Repenhardt had
            told them to meet up with Talkata here and then went back into the
            mansion. So, both of them were just standing there, waiting for him
            to return.

          <p>[ Chapter 44 ]</p>
          <p>Talkata asked Sillan,</p>
          <p>“Is it cold here? Should we start a fire?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, please do.”</p>
          <p>
            Only then did Sillan realize the others might be cold and hastily
            responded. Talkata ordered the orc slaves to start a bonfire. The
            slaves approached the bonfire to bask in its warmth. Elf women
            gathered around the fire, and the orc men, who highly valued women,
            naturally surrounded them from the outside. In their midst, a young
            elf girl was quietly crying in a woman’s embrace. It was this child
            who had been raped by Beret.
          </p>
          <p>“Mamia, Shal’ar Del Elia Santiana…”</p>
          <p>
            She was sobbing in Elvish, complaining of a stomach ache. Although
            Sillan’s healing magic should have already healed her body
            completely, that young girl was still feeling pain. The assault she
            had suffered was that cruel. Her mind was still wandering in that
            hell.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan sighed as he touched the girl’s forehead with a finger,
            alongside a simple prayer, leading the child into a gentle slumber.
            An elven woman expressed her gratitude before embracing the child
            tightly and began to softly stroke her hair.
          </p>
          <p>“El Lai Sandella Saian, Eldia di Sleinai…”</p>
          <p>
            The woman sang a lullaby in a soft voice. It was a song in Elvish,
            unforgotten even through centuries of life in bondage. Though their
            great culture and history had vanished, this lullaby had survived,
            passed from mouth to mouth.
          </p>
          <p>“Sharon de Eldia…”</p>
          <p>
            A low humming resonated in the ears. Sillan had a complex
            expression. It was his first time hearing a song in Elvish.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lullaby wasn’t merely a human song translated into Elvish; it
            contained a range of notes that only an elf’s voice could achieve,
            not something humans could replicate. Nor was it akin to the
            instinctual chirping of birds. It was proper music, with lyrics and
            rhythm.
          </p>
          <p>‘That means this song is a creation unique to the elves…’</p>
          <p>
            Music is a product of higher thought, enjoyed by those capable of
            emotional and rational thinking. If elves were truly born to be
            slaves, they wouldn’t possess such culture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan inadvertently turned to look at Siris. She was on guard with
            a cool demeanor, her eyes full of determination to protect them
            against any remaining forces that might emerge from the mansion.
            Talkata, too, held the same strong pride in his piercing gaze, sword
            in hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            They had never explicitly received such orders. No matter how much
            they denied it, they had to admit that it was their own will that
            drove them.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Have you ever properly talked to them even once? Have you never
            questioned the fact that they are slaves?
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s words kept swirling in his head.</p>
          <p>‘Am I… thinking about this wrong?’</p>
          <p>
            A rustling noise came from the bushes, and soon a large shadow
            appeared. Siris and Talkata tensed up for a moment before sheathing
            their swords. The figure that emerged was Repenhardt. Seeing Siris,
            he grinned broadly.
          </p>
          <p>“Sorry, did you wait long?”</p>
          <p>
            He was holding a bundle of various documents in both hands. Sillan
            asked curiously.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s that?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt grinned.</p>
          <p>
            “Slave documents and the seal of the head of the Rolpein Company.”
          </p>

          <p>
            This was the reason he had returned to the mansion. As Repenhardt
            sorted through the papers, he continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Given the importance of these documents, they were securely stored
            in a secret vault, which made it a bit of a hassle to find at
            first.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In his previous life, he would have easily located the secret space
            with magic, but now he lacked such abilities.
          </p>
          <p>“So how did you find it?”</p>
          <p>
            “I changed my approach. Just smashed the office wall, and there was
            the vault.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The vault, made of poured steel, was sturdy but not enough to
            withstand an aura-infused hammer. Seeing Repenhardt shrug his
            shoulders in self-admiration, Sillan clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow, that’s… crude.”</p>
          <p>“Cough!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was taken aback. In his previous fifty years of life, he
            had never been called crude!
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a moment for self-reflection. It seemed to him that ever
            since his reincarnation, he had never properly used his head, always
            resorting to physical force.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Have I been so immersed in simple and crude training that I’ve
            become accustomed to it?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, the results had always been good, so it wasn’t a big problem,
            but he was a mage. A mage’s way of thinking shouldn’t be so
            unsophisticated.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, I need to pull myself together. This is serious.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt groaned in self-criticism, while Sillan and Siris tilted
            their heads in unison, sharing a moment of confusion.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, how cute. The two lovely children striking the same pose.”</p>
          <p>
            Forgetting his worries, Repenhardt chuckled. His ‘simplification’
            was already well underway.
          </p>
          <p>“But why did you bring those?”</p>
          <p>“Because they’re needed.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt approached the campfire with the slave documents in hand.
            He held the papers to the flames and spoke to the slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you don’t want to continue living as slaves, I will grant you
            freedom. What do you say?”
          </p>
          <p>“Freedom?”</p>
          <p>
            The slaves murmured among themselves, looking at each other, having
            never considered such a proposition before.
          </p>
          <p>“What do you mean by granting freedom?”</p>
          <p>“I don’t know.”</p>
          <p>“New master. The command is too difficult.”</p>
          <p>
            Their faces showed that they didn’t even recognize what freedom was.
            Repenhardt grimaced bitterly.
          </p>

          <p>‘As expected…’</p>
          <p>
            These were not people who had lived freely before becoming slaves.
            They were born into slavery, so suddenly granting them freedom
            wouldn’t mean they could start living anew.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the world already belonged to humans. Even if he were to
            burn the slave documents, it wouldn’t make them free citizens.
            Without documents, they would be nothing more than ‘ownerless
            slaves,’ unable to be treated as free people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt collected the slave documents again and took out the seal
            of Rolpein.
          </p>
          <p>“If I do this…”</p>
          <p>
            He added new documents to the slave papers, signed them, and stamped
            the Rolpein seal. It was a declaration that all ownership of the
            slaves was transferred to Repenhardt from Teriq.
          </p>
          <p>“Legally, they are no longer Teriq’s slaves.”</p>
          <p>
            This made Repenhardt their new owner. It was a forced measure, but
            it was completely legal under the laws of the Chatan Principality.
            Sillan was puzzled.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s this? Are you planning to become a slave trader?”</p>
          <p>“No, I have no intention of selling them to anyone.”</p>
          <p>
            “Then, you’re not thinking of giving up being an adventurer to
            settle down, are you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan frowned. He had become Repenhardt’s companion because he was
            a wandering adventurer across the continent. However, if Repenhardt
            was planning to settle down somewhere, there would be no reason for
            him to stay by his side.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You’re not saying you’re going to wander the continent with all
            these slaves, are you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of course not. I just need this formality to provide them with a
            safe place.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Having neither a homeland to return to nor the ability to survive on
            their own, granting these individuals ‘freedom’ and telling them to
            ‘do as they wish!’ is nothing but self-satisfaction. It’s akin to
            throwing a domestically raised pet into the wild in the name of
            giving it freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his previous life, Repenhardt would rescue such slaves and lead
            them to remote areas to establish villages where they could live. He
            was a great sorcerer, and magic was not just about shooting fire or
            lightning. Rather, it was a practical and useful discipline that
            could transform even the harshest lands into habitable places by
            creating springs and growing plants with the power of magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, now, being nothing more than a martial artist, he was
            unable to do as he had in his past life.
          </p>
          <p>‘And even if I had the ability, I shouldn’t.’</p>
          <p>
            Doing so would only alarm humans and once again earn him the title
            of Demon King. He had no intention of walking down that failed path
            again. In a world where they themselves and everyone else considered
            them slaves, what meaning would there be in Repenhardt alone
            declaring ‘They are not slaves!’?
          </p>
          <p>‘Change begins with perception.’</p>
          <p>
            Sillan, looking utterly baffled, asked, “Provide a safe place? Do
            you have acquaintances here?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt smiled wryly.</p>
          <p>“Not exactly, but I have a place in mind.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Well into the evening, the city of Zeppelin was still bustling with
            activity despite the deep night. Street vendors moved about, and
            shops kept their lights on, engaging eagerly in attracting
            customers. In every tavern, weary travelers sipped their drinks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike other cities that closed their gates at sunset, the capital
            of Chatan Principality, Zeppelin, shut its gates only at midnight,
            hence the number of travelers entering the city late at night was
            significant. Moreover, with streetlamps lighting up the streets,
            conducting business was hardly hindered even deep into the night.
          </p>

          <p>
            It’s no wonder this place was praised as a city of merchants. The
            merchant-friendly policies of the Chatan Principality provided
            maximum convenience to those engaged in commerce.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a building engulfed in the nocturnal lights, on the second floor
            of a brick house bearing the sign ‘Taoban Trading Company,’ a man in
            his thirties was diligently working with papers and a pen.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Send a hundred and fifty coins to the Rath branch… and it’ll take
            three hundred and twenty-five coins to block the bills of exchange
            coming up from the Koll region.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siebolt was currently allocating the budget for each branch.
            Fortunately, a major investor had appeared that afternoon, providing
            a lifeline. Thus, he had to distribute the budget as quickly as
            possible to minimize losses.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Siebolt was deep in thought, an unexpected guest arrived—none
            other than the major investor. Surprised, he hurried to the
            reception room.
          </p>
          <p>“Is this not Lord Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>
            Greeting him, Siebolt cautiously observed the other’s reaction.
            Repenhardt, looking somewhat embarrassed, returned the greeting.
          </p>
          <p>“I apologize for the late-night intrusion.”</p>
          <p>“Late night? Oh, yes… well…”</p>
          <p>
            Siebolt was momentarily taken aback by Repenhardt’s greeting. To
            him, a citizen of Zeppelin, it was still early evening, not late
            night. However, there was no need to dwell on formalities. Siebolt
            quickly moved on to the matter at hand.
          </p>
          <p>“What brings you here, if I may ask?”</p>
          <p>
            Could it be that he had changed his mind and come to demand the
            investment back? But more than half of that money had already been
            spent! Siebolt felt a sudden sinking feeling. The laws of the Chatan
            Principality were generous to investors, allowing for contract
            cancellations within twenty-four hours. If not for the urgency,
            Siebolt would have waited at least a day before using the funds.
          </p>
          <p>Fortunately, it seemed that was not the case.</p>
          <p>“I have a favor to ask of you.”</p>
          <p>Siebolt looked puzzled at Repenhardt’s words.</p>
          <p>
            Siebolt glanced around the hall with a blank expression. The hall of
            the Taoban Trading Company’s first floor, which should have been
            empty with most clerks having gone home, was bustling with people.
            They were all elves and orcs.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt handed Siebolt a document of slavery.</p>
          <p>“I was hoping you could take care of these individuals.”</p>
          <p>Siebolt, surprised, asked after examining the document.</p>
          <p>
            “Are these slaves from Teriq? How did you manage to acquire all of
            them?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt chuckled and replied.</p>
          <p>“You’ll hear an interesting story by tomorrow morning.”</p>
          <p>He then added in a slightly lowered voice.</p>
          <p>
            “And you are the only one who knows about the protagonist of that
            story. So, if the secret leaks, you are the only one I would
            suspect.”
          </p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, don’t worry about it. It’s just a typical threat.”</p>
          <p>
            As if anyone could ignore a threat! Siebolt swallowed hard.
            Examining the document, he asked in a trembling voice.
          </p>
          <p>“It says here the slaves were ‘transferred,’ not ‘sold’?”</p>
          <p>
            It was definitely not a ‘sale,’ and the Teriq that Siebolt knew
            would never give anything away for free. Repenhardt smiled broadly
            and, instead of answering, changed the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Anyway, I would appreciate it if you could take care of them. This
            is certainly not a request to do it for free.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt pulled out a bag and emptied it onto the table. A flood
            of golden coins poured out.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Here are a hundred gold coins. I believe this should cover their
            expenses for the time being.”
          </p>
        </div>
        <div
          id="chr-content"

          <p>[ Chapter 45 ]</p>
          <p>“A hundred gold coins!”</p>
          <p>
            Siebolt’s eyes widened in surprise. Although the urgent need for
            funds had been alleviated, having a more substantial budget was
            always better. A hundred gold coins were not a small amount by any
            means. He was tempted to immediately reach out and grasp the gold
            coins.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, he did not nod in agreement right away. Like an experienced
            merchant, Siebolt had already roughly grasped the situation.
          </p>
          <p>‘This guy, he must have robbed the Rolpein estate, right?’</p>
          <p>
            Otherwise, there would be no reason for such slave documents to
            exist. Was he a skilled thief, or part of a robbery gang? Either
            way, it was clear that the slaves were not acquired through a
            legitimate transaction.
          </p>
          <p>‘He subtly threatened me as well.’</p>
          <p>
            Siebolt cautiously asked, sensing that getting involved with a thief
            could only lead to trouble.
          </p>
          <p>“Were you perhaps a member of the Night’s Wings?”</p>
          <p>
            It was a somewhat refined slang term for thieves. Repenhardt shook
            his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, but I have quite a bad history with the Rolpein Trading
            Company.”
          </p>
          <p>
            His confident gaze seemed to tell that he was not lying. Moreover,
            Siebolt prided himself on his ability to judge people. Repenhardt
            did not seem to have the demeanor of a villain.
          </p>
          <p>‘It seems he might be safe to deal with, but….’</p>
          <p>
            However, if he were to accept the slaves and the Rolpein Trading
            Company were to find out, the possibility of an irreversible
            conflict was too significant. Siebolt couldn’t help but feel
            conflicted.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            To accept was unsettling, but to reject meant forgoing a hundred
            enticingly luminous gold coins. Repenhardt calmly asked the
            conflicted Siebolt.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is there a problem? You seem to have a close relationship with the
            Rolpein Trading Company?”
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s when Siebolt realized. Becoming irreversible enemies with the
            Rolpein Trading Company?
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘What problem could there be when we are already in an all-out war?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Without any reservations, Siebolt smiled back as he pocketed the
            gold coins.
          </p>
          <p>“There’s no problem at all.”</p>
          <p>
            Given that the situation between the Taoban Trading Company and the
            Rolpein Trading Company had deteriorated to the point where one must
            fall for the other to survive, there was no reason not to accept
            this commission. Why refuse money that’s being offered?
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don’t worry. I also have a separate residence on the outskirts of
            Zeppelin. If they stay there, there’s absolutely no chance they will
            be exposed. They can live with my other slaves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Siebolt was putting the gold coins back into the bag, Repenhardt
            slightly threatened him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, but simply living there is not enough. I will not tolerate
            anyone other than me mistreating them or treating them like slaves.”
          </p>
          <p>“Then, that’s what we’ll do.”</p>

          <p>
            Siebolt readily agreed. Among those with an excessive sense of
            possession, there were quite a few who couldn’t tolerate their
            slaves receiving orders from anyone other than themselves.
            Therefore, Repenhardt’s request didn’t sound strange at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It seems they were all used as s*x slaves, the female elves. It
            would be best to isolate them after all.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Isolation meant merely giving them a separate house to live in and
            then ignoring them. It wasn’t a difficult request at all. Suddenly,
            Siebolt frowned.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But… a hundred gold coins is too much, isn’t it? Five gold coins
            should be enough to feed and shelter them all.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Being a man of business ethics, Siebolt was troubled by the
            excessive commission. No matter the difficulty of the situation, he
            would never accept unreasonable money, as it was against his pride.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of course, the payment isn’t just for feeding and sheltering them.”
          </p>
          <p>Siebolt, expecting such a response, waited for what came next.</p>
          <p>“I would like them to be educated.”</p>
          <p>“Excuse me?”</p>
          <p>Siebolt was a bit taken aback.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, they must have already received basic training under Teriq,
            hadn’t they?”
          </p>
          <p>“I’m not talking about simple slave training.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s expression became serious. This was the real crux of
            his plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I want to teach them letters and numbers, and depending on their
            level, even accounting, history, philosophy. If possible, medicine
            or pharmacology as well.”
          </p>
          <p>“To slaves?”</p>
          <p>
            Siebolt’s eyes widened. Why would he want to teach such things to
            slaves, who just needed to do their assigned tasks?
          </p>
          <p>“Why would you do that?”</p>
          <p>
            It sounded so absurd that Siebolt almost thought this imposing young
            man had gone mad. After all, Repenhardt had shown signs of madness
            since he started talking about investing in the Crovence Kingdom.
            Repenhardt continued, seeing the bewildered Siebolt.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s not that strange. The more a slave can do, the more convenient
            it is for their master, isn’t it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “But slaves can’t possibly do those things, can they? It seems like
            a waste of money…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “If it succeeds, the efficiency of the slaves could significantly
            improve. It’s not a bad idea, is it? If it fails, it’s my money
            that’s lost, not yours.”
          </p>
          <p>“Well, that’s true but…”</p>
          <p>
            Siebolt relented. It was an outrageous idea, and failure seemed
            inevitable, but if Repenhardt was willing to spend his own money,
            there was no reason to dissuade him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Um, I’d like to accommodate your request, but… realistically, it’s
            going to be difficult. Teaching them simple letters or numbers might
            be feasible, but scholarly fields are too much. There’s likely no
            one at the Chatan Academy willing to teach slaves.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Chatan Academy was a prestigious hall of academia, gathering all the
            principality’s esteemed scholars in one place. Because graduation
            almost guaranteed a high-ranking position within the principality,
            it was a popular institution among the youth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m well aware of how high the scholars of the academy hold their
            noses. I have no expectations of them, either.”
          </p>

          <p>“Then what?”</p>
          <p>“There are students learning there, aren’t there?”</p>
          <p>
            Though mostly attended by the offspring of the wealthy and nobility,
            Chatan Academy also had a significant number of commoners who
            struggled to earn their own money while pursuing their education.
            The idea was to bring these students in, pay them some money, and
            have them teach the slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But how can students, who haven’t even completed their studies,
            teach others?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “We’re not going to teach the slaves anything significant, are we?
            It doesn’t matter if it’s taught poorly.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, that’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            “Besides, it’s cheap. And it’ll be good for the students since they
            can earn some pocket money.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed quite plausible. While only fully educated scholars might
            be qualified to teach properly, if the learners were slaves, then
            even average students should be sufficient. Especially if those
            students were from commoner backgrounds, they likely wouldn’t have
            much pride to be hurt.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, all of this presupposed that the slaves had the capability
            to learn properly. Siebolt looked skeptical.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you wish, I will do as you ask, but I still don’t think slaves
            can comprehend academia as humans do.”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt simply smiled without a word.</p>
          <p>
            The notion of educating slaves wasn’t exactly a groundbreaking idea.
            Among the countless humans on the continent, it would be absurd to
            think that Repenhardt was the only one to ever consider it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it was virtually unheard of for someone of a status high
            enough to own slaves to entertain such a thought. To slave owners,
            suggesting such a thing was as nonsensical as giving a brush to a
            dog and expecting it to learn to paint. The belief that other races
            were inferior to humans had been a firmly established value for
            hundreds of years.
          </p>
          <p>‘I’ll use that value against them.’</p>
          <p>
            The paradigm that had tormented Repenhardt so much now became his
            weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The original reason for not educating slaves was to eliminate any
            chance of rebellion. When non-human races were first enslaved, human
            rulers knew this and deliberately prohibited the education of
            slaves, instilling in all humans the unshakeable belief that these
            races were nothing more than slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            After hundreds of years, humans had become accustomed to the idea
            that their non-human slaves couldn’t possibly think of rebelling.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘And they even forgot why they shouldn’t educate non-human races in
            the first place.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Once Repenhardt’s slaves started receiving education and began to
            awaken, even if just slightly, Siebolt would be surprised by the
            effects. And he would start to educate his own slaves. After all, if
            a slave’s performance improved, it naturally made life easier for
            their master.
          </p>
          <p>And, if done well, this trend might even spread to others.</p>
          <p>
            If non-human slaves began to receive proper education like humans,
            it was certain that some of them would start questioning their
            status as slaves. Over time, it was almost certain that a slave-led
            rebellion would occur. Of course, the likelihood of such a rebellion
            succeeding was low, since humans were still the rulers of all races.
            But at least, it would become clear that educating slaves could lead
            to them harboring rebellious thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            This point was crucial. It would naturally lead humans to realize
            that slaves could have their own will to rebel.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a change in perception that he had not managed to achieve
            in his past life.
          </p>
          <p>‘The beginning starts now.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smiled inwardly. What he had sown was a tiny seed of
            revolution. But in time, it would grow into a large tree that cast
            its shadow over the entire continent.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>

          <p>
            Thus, Repenhardt entrusted Siebolt with all the slaves. Every
            non-human race obediently followed his orders. Talkata asked to be
            taken along, but he was the only one among the slaves who possessed
            combat abilities and could not be separated from them. Someone had
            to stay behind to protect them in case of any eventuality. Talkata
            understood the reason and, although disappointed, he promised over
            his sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My lord, to whom I have pledged my sword. I swear on this blade to
            protect them with my life until you return.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a noble statement befitting a warrior, but since it was
            spoken in Orcish, Siebolt could only click his tongue. To him, it
            merely seemed like grumbling and growling.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, what’s the point in educating these brutes?’</p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, he planned to dutifully educate them as per the
            assignment. It wasn’t a trade in the usual sense for a merchant, but
            a deal was still a deal. Being faithful to the client’s request is
            the mark of a good merchant.
          </p>
          <p>
            After finishing his tasks, Repenhardt left the Taoban Trading
            Company. Sillan and Siris were waiting outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris insisted on staying outside despite the cold, to be prepared
            for any potential trackers. Sillan stayed with her for backup
            reasons. Approaching Repenhardt, Sillan urged him to hurry.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If you’re done with your work, let’s head to the inn, pack up, and
            leave immediately.”
          </p>
          <p>
            They had caused a significant trouble, necessitating their swift
            departure from the place. Repenhardt agreed. No matter how much they
            had manipulated memories to erase their traces, continuing to stay
            in this city was not wise.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Since we have no further business here, let’s leave at once. The
            city gates should still be open, right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s still time before midnight; we have plenty of time. We
            should also buy some food supplies for the journey.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt and his party hurried to the Golden Rest to check out and
            then went to a nearby general store to buy the necessities for their
            trip. It was right when Repenhardt was about to take out his wallet
            to pay.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt’s expression turned pale.</p>
          <p>“Ah….”</p>
          <p>
            He then looked extremely embarrassed. To think Repenhardt, who stood
            tall against ancient demons and aura users, would show such a face!
            Sillan asked in serious surprise.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s wrong? Did something happen?”</p>
          <p>
            Did they make some mistake at the Rolpein mansion? Sillan’s face was
            full of tension. Repenhardt looked down at him and stuttered.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, you see, Sillan. The thing is…”</p>
          <p>“What is it, exactly?”</p>
          <p>After sighing deeply, Repenhardt whispered in a tiny voice.</p>
          <p>“I, I need to borrow some money.”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            He had been so generous with his spending that he had even handed
            over the last of his necessary expenses to Siebolt! Sillan was
            dumbfounded and chuckled before taking out his wallet to pay
            instead. Siris, with an indifferent face, watched this and asked.
          </p>
          <p>“Should I return this dress?”</p>
          <p>
            In her own way, it was Siris’ attempt to consider Repenhardt’s
            situation. It seemed like he had run out of money, and returning
            this unnecessarily expensive dress might just net him some cash.
            After the incident at the Rolpein mansion, she had somewhat opened
            her heart to Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>‘He’s a pervert, but at least he’s a good pervert….’</p>
          <p>
            Of course, listening to this was only painful for Repenhardt. The
            feeling of a man running out of money in front of the woman he loves
            is universally the same throughout all ages, regardless of whether
            he’s a Demon King or anyone else!
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh….”</p>
          <p>
            With nothing to say, Repenhardt just bowed his head in shame.
            Despite his large frame, seeing him so deflated was somewhat cute.
            Siris unconsciously giggled with laughter.
          </p>
          <p>“Ahaha….”</p>
          <p>
            Unbeknownst to Repenhardt, preoccupied with his miserliness, this
            was the first time she had laughed since becoming a slave.

          <p>[ Chapter 46 ]</p>
          <p>The next morning, Zeppelin city was in chaos.</p>
          <p>
            Teriq, the head of the famous Rolpein Trading Company, had been
            found as a horrific corpse. Beside him, Beret, the heir of the Caron
            Trading Company, was also found dead. With two prominent figures
            from the Chatan Principality brutally murdered, it was natural for
            Zeppelin city to be turned upside down. An investigation team was
            immediately assembled to find the perpetrator with a sense of
            urgency.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the identity of the murderer remained undisclosed.
            Strangely enough, the employees of the Rolpein mansion remembered
            nothing. The only testimony that came forward was this:
          </p>
          <p>“It was an elf with a huge stature, as beautiful as a woman.”</p>
          <p>
            The memories of Sillan, Siris, and Repenhardt intertwined, creating
            a bizarre monster. Although everyone was perplexed by the
            description, it was so absurd that it seemed plausible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rumors circulated throughout Zeppelin city that a high-ranking
            magician had created a new chimera-type monster to kill the two
            young men. The disappearance of elf and orc slaves from the mansion
            added credibility to the rumor, suggesting that the magician had
            taken them as materials for the chimera.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, all this commotion had nothing to do with Repenhardt and
            his party. Having traveled through the night, they were already on a
            mountain path far from Zeppelin city.
          </p>
          <p>Walking through the twisted forest path, Sillan asked,</p>
          <p>“Where are we going now?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt replied shortly,</p>
          <p>“Setellad mountain range.”</p>
          <p>
            The Setellad mountain range was located in the northwestern part of
            the continent, in the middle of the Graim Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s quite far, isn’t it?”</p>
          <p>
            Although there were many unexplored dungeons nearby, Repenhardt
            deliberately chose the distant Setellad mountain range as their
            destination. Sillan asked again,
          </p>
          <p>“What’s there?”</p>
          <p>“Forgotten ancient ruins, Elucion.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt replied with a meaningful tone. And he added to himself,
          </p>
          <p>‘Because what’s necessary to regain magic is there.’</p>
          <p>
            In a passage made of gray rocks, surrounded by darkness, lights
            flickered continuously.
          </p>
          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            A blue flame, filled with malevolent energy, flew towards them. In
            an instant, a sword light split the flame in two. Piercing through
            the divided flame, a beautiful elf girl with platinum blonde hair
            charged forward. The blade of her long sword sharply descended upon
            the head of a Night Skull that had spewed magical flame.
          </p>
          <p>“Yaah!”</p>
          <p>
            The darkened skull shattered, and the human illusion that had been
            overlaid on it scattered like a candle flame in the wind. With a
            scream, the bisected Night Skull crumbled.
          </p>
          <p>“Keeeh!”</p>
          <p>Behind, Sillan shouted,</p>
          <p>“Siris! Be careful!”</p>

          <p>
            Another Night Skull was lunging at her with its sword, its blue eyes
            glinting fiercely. Despite the rust on the blade, the energy
            entwined around the sword’s body was not to be underestimated. Siris
            quickly turned her body and deflected the sword with a swift motion.
          </p>
          <p>Clang!</p>
          <p>
            Stepping firmly, Siris elevated her momentum in an instant and
            pushed the Night Skulls back with her sword. At that moment, Sillan
            raised a prayer.
          </p>
          <p>
            “O Philanence! Bestow upon these cursed beings the light of
            purification!”
          </p>
          <p>
            A pinkish holy light extended from Sillan’s fingertips, sweeping
            over the Night Skulls. This technique, known as Turn Undead, caused
            the fraudulent aura enveloping the skeletons to shake violently as
            if caught in a storm. However, befitting their status as top-tier
            undead monsters within the skeleton lineage, the Night Skulls were
            not completely purified.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan clicked his tongue in frustration.</p>
          <p>“Damn! Is that not enough?”</p>
          <p>
            The momentarily repelled Night Skulls once again charged at Siris.
            Despite her best efforts to block them, the overwhelming numbers
            began to gradually push her back. Seeing this, Sillan reached out to
            Siris, uttering another prayer with urgency shortening his words.
          </p>
          <p>“Philanence! Full service for her!”</p>
          <p>
            Though it hardly seemed like a prayer anymore, divine protection was
            miraculously activated. True to the goddess’s insight, she
            understood even such a rudimentary plea.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris was enveloped in various physical enhancement spells, glowing
            in pink. The pink elf girl charged towards the blue skeletons, sword
            in hand, yelling out her battle cry.
          </p>
          <p>“Yaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Repenhardt was fighting against five demons on the
            opposite side of the corridor, occasionally glancing back.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm, their coordination is spot on.”</p>
          <p>
            It was quite common for warriors and clerics to team up, but
            properly supporting each other in battle required significant
            experience. Yet, this duo displayed exquisite teamwork, as if they
            had been together for years.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘That’s less about Siris being impressive and more about Sillan
            having experienced various partners.’
          </p>
          <p>
            While Siris was undoubtedly a genius swordsman, her experience was
            lacking. The remarkable teamwork was entirely thanks to Sillan, that
            young boy.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘How old was he when he started facing real battles? To have that
            level of experience at his age?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan turned out to be an even more remarkable cleric than
            expected. Moreover, his divine power was formidable. If he continued
            to grow at this rate, he might become an even greater priest than
            Saintess Ellin, his nemesis in a past life.
          </p>
          <p>A question then arose,</p>
          <p>‘But why was someone like him unknown until now?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had recognized numerous esteemed clerics in his previous
            life. Being the Emperor of the Antares Empire, it was essential for
            him to gather such intelligence, especially since the entire
            continent was hostile towards him. However, Sillan’s name was never
            among those he had identified. It seemed unlikely that Sillan,
            though still young now, would not become a great cleric in the
            future.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Could it be that this kid meets an untimely death? Or perhaps he
            has a chronic illness?’
          </p>
          <p>
            During a moment of leisure, Repenhardt considered visiting a medical
            guild.
          </p>
          <p>“Talkera!”</p>
          <p>
            An demon launched an attack with a loud shout, piercing Repenhardt’s
            guard and scratching his shoulder with its claw.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>

          <p>
            The pain was minor, despite the tear in his clothing. Repenhardt
            frowned and lashed out fiercely with his limbs.
          </p>
          <p>“This bastard!”</p>
          <p>
            His furious punches and kicks swirled like a tornado, pulling the
            demons towards him. In this state, Repenhardt quickly recalled the
            weaknesses of his adversaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The weak point of this one is the nucleus in its side, that one’s
            is its horns. And this one? Ah, just hitting it hard will do.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Golden aura surged, swiftly overpowering the demons. Knowing their
            weaknesses made them far from challenging opponents. Some, sensitive
            to cold or possessing magical vulnerabilities, required more effort,
            but relentless assault was generally effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, all the demons were annihilated, leaving a scene of blood and
            gore. Amidst the carnage, Repenhardt caught his breath. Siris and
            Sillan, having dealt with the Night Skulls, approached him.
            Repenhardt turned to inquire about their well-being.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you hurt?”</p>
          <p>Sillan, nodding, glanced down the corridor.</p>
          <p>
            “No, but did you say this ruin is called Elucion? It seems even more
            formidable than the Falton ruins.”
          </p>
          <p>“Still, this back way is somewhat easier.”</p>
          <p>
            Fifteen days after leaving the Principality of Chatan, Repenhardt
            and his companions entered the Kingdom of Graim, heading straight
            for the Setellad mountain range and then to the Elucion ruins.
            Remarkably, Repenhardt unlocked a secret door to a hidden passage by
            simply moving a few stones on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>“Why bother with hardship when you know an easier path?”</p>
          <p>
            The relic they sought, “Voice of Elucion,” was located in the heart
            of the ruins. Repenhardt, having endured numerous trials in his past
            life, had explored every passage, eventually discovering this hidden
            route. Though relics from the Silver Age were scattered throughout
            the ruins, not just at the center, Repenhardt had no intention of
            ignoring these treasures. However, disarming the defense system in
            the central area would certainly make exploring the ruins much
            easier.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, the three of them advanced along the hidden passage.
            Repenhardt dealt with the powerful demons, while Sillan and Siris
            took care of the relatively weaker undead, quickly heading towards
            the center of the ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Had it been about an hour? The passage ended, revealing a large
            stone door in front of them. It was a door overlaid with complex
            patterns, plated with various magical metals. Repenhardt smirked.
          </p>
          <p>“We’ve arrived.”</p>
          <p>Sillan examined the door and frowned.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s a door sealed with magic. It can’t be opened with force, can
            it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            A door sealed with magic cannot be broken with mere physical force.
            The sealing spell forcibly disperses the applied physical force in
            all directions. The same force, if applied with a drill, would
            penetrate deeply, but if hit with bare hands, it would leave the
            wood unscathed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, with Repenhardt’s physical strength as an aura wielder,
            he could split a fully grown tree with his bare hands. But that
            would mean the tree, and in this case, the stone chamber, would be
            blown away. Breaking the sealing spell with mere strength would be
            akin to blowing away the entire stone chamber.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s why I said we should hire a magician, didn’t I? You kept
            saying we didn’t need one….”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan grumbled repeatedly. It was a natural reaction, as they
            seemed to have to turn back when they were so close. The spell to
            open doors, a 3rd circle spell, could be used by any competent
            magician. If they had brought any magician with them, they could
            have easily solved this problem.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, however, was calm. It’s not that he didn’t know there
            would be such a door here.
          </p>
          <p>“Wait. I’ll prepare a spell.”</p>
          <p>
            He said nonchalantly as he sat down cross-legged. Sillan asked in
            astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“Wait, Mr. Repen, you can use magic too?”</p>
          <p>“Yeah, I was originally a magician.”</p>

          <p>
            Though the explanation was skipped, the answer was undoubtedly true.
            However, for Sillan, who was unaware of the details, it was an
            astonishing revelation.
          </p>
          <p>“Whaaat?”</p>
          <p>
            In the world, there certainly are professions like magic swordsmen
            or magic fist fighters who utilize both magic and martial arts.
            However, magic swordsmen are mostly former mercenaries who, feeling
            the limitations of their abilities, use magical tools or learn a few
            simple spells to enhance their bodies. True magic swordsmen, skilled
            in both areas, are extremely rare. And then…
          </p>
          <p>“Mr. Repen, you were a magic fist fighter?”</p>
          <p>
            Magic fist fighters, in fact, is another term for combat magicians,
            those among magicians who specialize only in combat magic. For
            warriors of the battlefield who dodge flying spears and cast spells,
            it’s a perfectly logical choice to also learn physical techniques.
            However, that’s merely about magicians also learning physical
            techniques, not about formally walking the path of a warrior.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, Mr. Repen, you’re telling me that not only are you smart enough
            to learn magic, but you also have a talent for martial arts and have
            even awakened your aura?”
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s unfair! Some people desperately practice, hoping just to
            achieve a masculine physique and don’t get anywhere, while others
            are blessed with both brains and brawn! Why is the world so unjust!
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan was fuming with jealousy as he looked at Repenhardt with
            envious eyes. Suddenly, he tilted his head in confusion.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you doing now?”</p>
          <p>
            The man who was about to cast a spell has been sitting and closing
            his eyes all this time.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m meditating. I need to gather my mana.”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            It made even less sense to him. Meditation for a 3rd circle spell?
            How much mana does it need? But Repenhardt did not reply anymore and
            concentrated on meditating.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, he sat cross-legged, engrossed in meditation for about ten
            minutes. Finally, when he had gathered enough mana to cast a 3rd
            circle spell, he slowly began to recite the spell.
          </p>
          <p>“Ralphia… de… Lathea… Volt…”</p>
          <p>
            It took him about 30 seconds to prepare the incantation that
            converts internal mana into magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            “By the ancient names, I command… the power of the seal… open that
            closed door.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It took another 30 seconds to verbalize the magic formula that turns
            converted magic into a spell.
          </p>
          <p>“…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan’s jaw dropped. He had never seen such a slow spell in his
            life.
          </p>
          <p>
            At last, Repenhardt shouted the activation word for materialization.
          </p>
          <p>“Gate Open!”</p>
          <p>
            The stone door vibrated slightly as the sealing spell was released.
            It creaked open slowly. The door of an ancient relic that might not
            have moved for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years, had opened!
          </p>
          <p>
            … Of course, Sillan, who was watching from the side, felt no
            excitement whatsoever.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mr. Repenhardt, please don’t go around calling yourself a
            magician.”
          </p>
          <p>
            His resentment at Repenhardt originally being a magician had
            completely dissipated. A magician? It took nearly a minute for a 3rd
            circle spell?
          </p>
          <p>“Quiet, I opened it anyway.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt stood up with an indifferent expression. In his past
            life, he had been the first 10th circle great magician in history,
            ruling over the entire continent even as a Demon King, and now he
            was hearing such comments?
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah, really, I need to find the voice of Elucion fast. This is so
            frustrating.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, the door was open. What he had been longing for was supposed
            to be inside. Excited, Repenhardt stepped inside. That was the
            moment.
          </p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>A cry full of dismay burst from his lips.</p>
          <p>“What? Why is it empty?”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 47 ]</p>
          <p>
            In the midst of a harsh winter at the foothills of the Setellad
            mountain range, three figures traversed a small path through the
            pristine snow-covered mountains. A platinum-haired elf girl and a
            handsome boy with red hair followed a step behind, silently, while a
            large young man led the way, continuously sighing deeply.
          </p>
          <p>“Haah, how did this happen?”</p>
          <p>
            As he moved, Repenhardt let out another sigh. Sillan offered a
            comforting smile and reassured him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hey, Mr. Repen, don’t be too down. These things happen in life,
            right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            After discovering the empty heart of the ruins, Repenhardt quickly
            moved to explore other areas. But the result was the same
            everywhere. The only things present were various monsters bound by
            the ruins, and all artifacts from his memories had vanished.
            Moreover, clear signs of recent destruction were visible throughout
            the passageways and chambers.
          </p>
          <p>It was clear. Someone had raided the Elucion ruins before him!</p>
          <p>Sillan continued with a light-hearted comment.</p>
          <p>
            “Those ruins weren’t your property, Mr. Repen. Someone else could
            have explored them first.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The tale of rushing to ancient ruins after purchasing expensive
            information, only to find someone else had already looted them, was
            a common story among adventurers. Thus, Sillan didn’t find the
            situation strange at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, for Repenhardt, the situation was utterly unacceptable. The
            discovery of the Elucion ruins was supposed to happen 17 years
            later, by Repenhardt himself. This wasn’t a simple case of someone
            getting there first.
          </p>
          <p>‘The future has changed…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, having time-traveled to this era, had anticipated that
            the future might gradually become distorted. As a mage, he was
            well-versed in the concept of causality.
          </p>
          <p>‘Could the effects be happening already?’</p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t impossible. For example, if a person who was supposed to
            die in Repenhardt’s past lived because of him, that person could
            accidentally discover this dungeon.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Sillan, unaware of the complexities, simply interpreted
            Repenhardt’s expression as one of someone who had come up
            empty-handed and continued to offer consolation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And it’s not like we came away with nothing. That seems like a
            pretty amazing artifact.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As he spoke, Sillan glanced at Siris, who was walking behind them.
            She was fiddling with a small stick, about 30 centimeters long, in
            her left hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first glance, it was a plain wooden stick without any decoration.
            However, as Siris murmured softly, the stick began to transform.
          </p>

          <p>“Nihillen.”</p>
          <p>
            Light poured from both ends of the stick, forming a shape. It
            lengthened from side to side, bending smoothly, and strands of light
            emerged, connecting its ends. What was once a mere stick became a
            large bow of light.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris placed her hand on the bowstring of light. An arrow of light
            materialized in her grasp. She repeatedly drew the bowstring.
          </p>
          <p>Pop, pop, pop!</p>
          <p>
            The arrows of light were rapidly fired, successively snapping
            branches of trees dozens of meters away. Sillan asked, observing her
            actions,
          </p>
          <p>“How is it, Siris?”</p>
          <p>“It’s a remarkable weapon.”</p>
          <p>
            Even within her cold tone, an undeniable excitement was evident.
            Siris was utterly fascinated by this new magical bow.
          </p>
          <p>The Magic Bow Nihillen.</p>
          <p>
            This magical bow did not require separate arrows, was unaffected by
            wind or gravity, and could load and fire multiple arrows depending
            on the user’s concentration. Moreover, it had the power of mana
            gathering, automatically charging with magical power even when left
            alone, and, most importantly, it was extremely portable. After all,
            it was just a stick in its normal state. Even Sillan, who had seen
            quite a few artifacts from the Age of Silver, recognized it as a
            significant artifact.
          </p>
          <p>“To just abandon such an incredible thing, tsk tsk.”</p>
          <p>
            Unlike other relics, this one appeared to be just a simple piece of
            wood, which was probably why it was left behind. Since it did not
            emanate any magical power, it’s likely that its previous owner
            didn’t realize it was an artifact.
          </p>
          <p>“But how did Mr. Repen know this was an artifact?”</p>
          <p>
            In fact, the Magic Bow Nihillen had been the primary weapon used by
            Siris in her past life. At that time, Repenhardt hadn’t fully
            realized its significance as a great relic. He had brought it back
            for research, intrigued by the material of the stick he had never
            seen before, and during this research, he discovered its functions
            and gifted it to Siris. It was only later that he realized the stick
            was a remnant of the World Tree Elvenheim.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, he couldn’t tell Sillan the entire story, so he vaguely
            brushed it off.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, I had some information about it. Anyway, I’m glad you like it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt smiled weakly, watching Siris as she continued to shoot
            Nihillen at nearby trees as they walked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The arrows shot by Nihillen differed subtly in aiming sensation
            compared to ordinary bows, especially since they were unaffected by
            gravity and flew in a straight line instead of an arc. Thus, Siris
            was diligently comparing the archery she had learned with the usage
            of Nihillen, adjusting her senses.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, don’t be too disappointed. It’s not like Elucion is the only
            ancient site on the continent, right?”
          </p>
          <p>“Um, that’s true, but…”</p>

          <p>
            Despite Sillan’s comforting voice, Repenhardt’s expression did not
            lighten.
          </p>
          <p>‘The Voice of Elucion is unique.’</p>
          <p>
            The future might have changed, but what hit him the hardest was his
            failure to acquire the item he immediately needed. The other relics
            were manageable, but there was no substitute for the Voice of
            Elucion. It was the only artifact in the world that could restore
            magical powers to him.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            As he walked along the mountain path, he could see white smoke
            billowing from beyond the forest. And then, a large village
            encircled by tall fences emerged through the trees. Sillan said with
            a delighted expression, “Ah, it’s starting to come into view.
            Gehallen Village. It’s been a while since we’ve had someone else
            cook for us. Let’s grab a meal here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Gehallen Village was a fairly large mountain village located on the
            western side of the Setellad mountain range. Situated at a pass
            through the mountains, most of the houses in the village doubled as
            inns. Repenhardt and his party found an inn bustling with people and
            ordered their food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, a robust-looking lady came to their table, her arms laden with
            generous portions of bread, soup, and salad.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Eat up, everyone. Should I prepare another serving for each
            person?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The lady joked, looking at Repenhardt’s sturdy frame. They all began
            to eat, feeling the warmth of rural hospitality. The simple fare of
            black bread and pumpkin soup was surprisingly delicious. Sillan
            looked a bit surprised. Despite the humble ingredients, the flavor
            was impressive?
          </p>
          <p>“Wow, this is delicious!”</p>
          <p>“Isn’t it? Our cook’s skills are top-notch.”</p>
          <p>
            The lady beamed with pride, then her expression suddenly turned
            sour.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But those pompous fellows, thinking they’re food critics, were
            complaining this and that.”
          </p>
          <p>“Pompous fellows?”</p>
          <p>
            “Some knights from a noble family arrived here about a week ago.
            They said something about exploring a ruin?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s eyes gleamed sharply.</p>
          <p>“Could you tell us more about that?”</p>
          <p>“Eh? Why do you ask, young man?”</p>
          <p>
            The lady looked puzzled, tilting her head. Repenhardt discreetly
            handed her a silver coin, which she refused with a frown.
          </p>

          <p>“Hey, you don’t need to pay for stories like this.”</p>
          <p>
            Eventually, after a lecture on how young men should not frivolously
            spend money lest they be punished, Repenhardt finally got the story
            he wanted.
          </p>
          <p>“So, about a week ago…”</p>
          <p>
            A group of knights had stopped by Gehallen Village with the intent
            of exploring a new ruin in the Setellad mountains. They stayed here
            for a while, getting ready, and complained constantly about how
            uncomfortable the beds were and how the food was unfit even for
            dogs.
          </p>
          <p>“Did you not hear where they are from?”</p>
          <p>
            “They were brought by Viscount Kelberen, but somehow, they all
            seemed to rank higher than the Viscount himself.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This village of Gehallen was one of the autonomous communities under
            Viscount Kelberen’s jurisdiction. So, it was understandable that
            they recognized Viscount Kelberen but not the others.
          </p>
          <p>‘Maybe I should head to Viscount Kelberen’s residence first?’</p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt was lost in thought, the lady clapped her hands and
            continued speaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah! Now that I think about it, there was one knight among them
            shining in gold. He was a truly good man. Kind and considerate even
            to us villagers. But it was funny to see him all in gold, even his
            sword was made of gold.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In an instant, Repenhardt realized the identity of the person. A
            golden armor and a golden sword could only mean one thing in this
            vast continent.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘… The Golden Knight of Graim! They were from the Count Tenes
            family.’
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The Viscountcy of Kelberen was located near the southwestern side of
            the Setellad mountain range. It was a small domain, mostly
            mountainous, which barely managed self-sufficiency in agriculture.
            However, it boasted rich deposits of iron and copper ore, making the
            lives of its people quite affluent. Thanks to these resources,
            Viscount Kelberen was considered one of the wealthiest individuals
            in the Kingdom of Graim, despite his lower noble rank.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inside the castle of the Viscount, a man appearing to be in his
            mid-thirties was dining with the Viscount. With a lavish feast
            before them, the Viscount of Kelberen, who was over fifty, was
            earnestly showering the man with praises.
          </p>
          <p>“You are truly remarkable, Sir Eusus!”</p>
          <p>The man humbly shook his head in response.</p>
          <p>
            “It is all thanks to the assistance I have received from Viscount
            Kelberen.”
          </p>
          <p>The Viscount waved his hand and continued speaking.</p>
          <p>
            “Even so, wasn’t it Sir Eusus who vanquished the monsters of that
            ruin? Truly, the Golden Knight of Graim, his fame is not unmerited
            as I have clearly seen.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a month ago that Viscount Kelberen had received a message
            from the man before him, Eusus. He had doubted at first whether the
            tale of a tremendous ancient ruin lying dormant within his domain
            was anything but a dream. After all, the wealth that could be
            acquired from exploring such ancient ruins was extraordinary, and no
            lord would find unwelcome news in the prospect.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, what truly delighted the Viscount wasn’t the existence of
            the ruins, but the opportunity to forge a friendship with the Golden
            Knight, Sir Eusus. For a rural noble of little consequence,
            possessing nothing but wealth, the chance to become acquainted with
            a knight of high renown within the Kingdom of Graim was almost
            non-existent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following Eusus’s request, the Viscount made preparations for the
            exploration and welcomed the Tenes Knights. He even joined the
            expedition himself to strengthen their bond. Having never neglected
            his knightly training since his youth, he was a robust man,
            embodying the vitality of youth despite being over fifty. He was
            confident in his ability to protect himself, no matter the dangers
            of the ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout this journey undertaken to build a closer relationship,
            Viscount Kelberen found himself genuinely enchanted by Sir Eusus.
            The knight was strong and kind, always composed in any situation,
            and caring towards his subordinates. He was the epitome of a knight
            out of a tale.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite losing many men in the perilous exploration, Eusus
            successfully explored the ancient ruin, Elucion, and returned with
            tremendous treasure.

          <p>[ Chapter 48 ]</p>
          <p>
            Viscount Kelberen glanced out the window. In the castle garden,
            about a dozen magicians were busy classifying and investigating
            relics obtained from a ruin, employing orc slaves for the task.
          </p>
          <p>Noticing his demeanor, Eusus spoke earnestly.</p>
          <p>
            “Do not worry, Viscount Kelberen. As we agreed beforehand, one-third
            of the relics will be yours.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That is not important. I have had the honor of fighting alongside
            Graim’s Golden Knight; what are these relics in comparison? You may
            take them all, it makes no difference to me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Viscount was serious. In reality, he had no desire for the
            relics. After all, he had more than enough wealth. More importantly,
            maintaining a good relationship with this man before him was far
            more beneficial. Even if he lived in this small domain, he wished to
            show a bigger world to his descendants.
          </p>
          <p>Eusus’s expression brightened, sensing his sincerity.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s truly admirable that you do not covet such treasures before
            you. Ah, but how do you plan to deal with the adamantium and
            orichalcum ores found in the ruins?”
          </p>
          <p>
            While relics from ancient ruins were generally finished products,
            occasionally, rare magical metals in raw form were also discovered.
            This time, they had found significant quantities of adamantium and
            orichalcum in Elucion. However, no matter how extraordinary these
            magical metals were, unprocessed, they were no different from
            ordinary stones.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ha, I’ve already ordered the ‘land dogs’ we have to smelt those
            into armor and weapons. We should have some decent items in about a
            fortnight.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, the Kelberen family is renowned for its mining operations.
            You have many skilled dwarves at your disposal.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus smiled broadly. As expected, the wealth of the Kelberen family
            did not merely come from owning mines. For generations, the Kelberen
            family had enslaved dwarves to mine ores and then refined them to
            manufacture various weapons and armors for sale. Thus, this time
            too, they expected to produce excellent items.
          </p>
          <p>
            Viscount Kelberen pulled out a bottle of wine with a fancy label and
            poured some for Eusus.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Relax and enjoy the drink. It’s a 21-year-old wine from Norgan.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, such a fine wine?”</p>
          <p>
            “However fine it may be, it pales in comparison to Graim’s Golden
            Knight.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You flatter me too much. There are many knights in the Graim
            Kingdom far superior to me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your remarkable valor and humility truly set an example for all
            knights. Please, accept it.”
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you.”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus tilted the wine glass, taking in the aroma, and exclaimed in
            admiration.
          </p>
          <p>“Such a wonderful scent.”</p>
          <p>
            In the warm atmosphere, they enjoyed their evening meal. As the mood
            became more congenial, Lord Kelberen clapped his hands. The butler
            nodded and, after a moment, reappeared with two girls in glamorous
            dresses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Kelberen smiled broadly and said, “These are my daughters.
            Please, give your greetings. You stand before the renowned Golden
            Knight of Graim, Sir Eusus Tenes.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The girls slightly lifted their skirts and presented a noble curtsy.
            Both possessed considerable beauty. Kelberen subtly hinted, “I am
            aware you’re married. I merely hoped for a good friendship…”
          </p>

          <p>
            It was clear that Lord Kelberen was insinuating a connection between
            his daughters and Eusus. Even though marriage was involved, it was
            common for high nobility to take concubines. Especially for someone
            of Eusus’s renown, it wouldn’t be seen as a flaw but rather a heroic
            trait. Hence, Lord Kelberen’s behavior wasn’t against the nobility’s
            etiquette, especially since both his daughters were renowned
            beauties in the vicinity.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Eusus’s expression turned noticeably stiffer, a clear sign
            of discomfort.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m sorry, but I have no intention of entertaining any woman other
            than my wife,” he stated firmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Kelberen was momentarily taken aback. Did his daughters not
            appeal to him? But it seemed more about the situation being
            distasteful than anything else.
          </p>
          <p>‘Did I do something wrong?’</p>
          <p>
            Then, Lord Kelberen remembered another rumor about the Tenes family.
            He muttered, “Ah, that brother of yours…”
          </p>
          <p>Crash!</p>
          <p>
            The wine glass in Eusus’s hand shattered. His previously gentlemanly
            expression turned demonic. Eusus’s voice was as cold as the northern
            winds, “I have no brother.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A terrifying aura filled the space, freezing Lord Kelberen, the
            butler, and both daughters in fear. Only then did Eusus realize his
            mistake and promptly apologized.
          </p>
          <p>“My apologies. I’ve been rude.”</p>
          <p>
            The menacing aura vanished. Finally, Lord Kelberen could breathe
            again. He was internally shocked; he hadn’t expected the impeccable
            Golden Knight to show such a human side. This didn’t diminish his
            reverence, but rather increased his fascination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feeling guilty for offending the hero, Lord Kelberen bowed hastily,
            “I’m so, so sorry for this oversight…”
          </p>
          <p>
            He gestured to the butler to take his daughters away. Watching the
            pale-faced young ladies, Eusus offered a bitter smile. After all,
            what fault did these girls have? They were merely following their
            father’s instructions and ended up being unfairly treated.
          </p>
          <p>Eusus stood and escorted the two girls.</p>
          <p>
            “If such a lovely lady were before me, surely there are better
            suitors than a married man like myself. How could I dare covet this
            fresh bloom? Merely to gaze upon you and catch your scent is an
            honor. Would you grant me the pleasure of your company, Lady?”
          </p>
          <p>“Eh? Oh, yes….”</p>
          <p>
            The girls, who had been pale just moments before, now blushed a rosy
            hue. Indeed, Sir Eusus lived up to his reputation as the knight
            among knights. Even after a brief misstep, he had skillfully changed
            the atmosphere. It was at this moment as he was about to lift his
            glass again,
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            A scream came from outside the window. Startled, Eusus kicked back
            his chair and ran to the window.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s happening?”</p>
          <p>
            Outside, a red glow flickered. The garden was catching fire in
            various places, and amidst it, magicians, servants, and slaves were
            scrambling for safety. Spotting a servant passing below, Eusus
            shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on? Report!”</p>
          <p>The servant looked up, voice panicked.</p>
          <p>“A demon has emerged from one of the relics!”</p>

          <p>Eusus’s face twisted in frustration.</p>
          <p>“Damn! Was there a summoning artifact mixed in?”</p>
          <p>
            Kelberen’s garden had turned into a blazing inferno. The dried
            garden plants were reduced to ashes by the roaring flames, and thick
            gray smoke billowed upwards. At the heart of this destruction roared
            a gigantic black monster.
          </p>
          <p>“Kraaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            It was Sephiatan, a demon with the body of a black lion and the
            upper body of a giant. Among the relics brought from the Elucion
            ruins was a statue enchanted with magic to summon demons from
            another world. It seems the spell was activated while the magicians
            were channeling magic into the relic for examination.
          </p>
          <p>“Krallalalala!”</p>
          <p>
            Sephiatan, standing on four legs, swung its broadswords left and
            right, spreading flames in all directions. The beast was nearly
            three meters tall at the shoulder, making the broadsword, usually a
            one-handed weapon, appear gigantic, even larger than many
            greatswords. Wherever the blade passed, humans were cleaved in half,
            spurting geysers of blood.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaagh!”</p>
          <p>“Save us!”</p>
          <p>
            Servants and slaves ran in terror, only to die screaming, engulfed
            in flames. The magicians confronted it with their spells, to little
            effect. One of the magicians cursed.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn! Why did it have to be something like that?”</p>
          <p>
            Summoning artifacts were so rare that even a lifetime of exploring
            ruins might not yield a single sighting. It wasn’t so much the
            magicians’ fault as it was a case of terribly bad luck.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Tenes Knight Order arrived late, fully armed, and rushed to the
            garden. Twenty knights, led by the deputy commander, Sir Lot,
            shouted commands.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Evacuate the people and form up! Magicians to the rear! All
            knights, raise your shields! Clerics, bestow your blessings!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Under the command of Sir Lot, the knights quickly dispersed.
            Shielding themselves with their shields, they encircled the demon as
            Sephiatan continuously spewed flames, engulfing the knights. As the
            flames met the shields, a blue holy light flickered and pushed the
            flames away, a divine protection granted by the priests of Aerius,
            the goddess of the sky.
          </p>
          <p>
            “O Aerius! Your humble servant pleads! Grant those with valor the
            power to eradicate this evil menace!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The magicians in the rear promptly created a wall of frost to
            prevent the flames from spreading.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Cold winds of the frozen lands! Heed my call and come forth to this
            place! Wall of Ice!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite the urgent situation, as soon as the command was given,
            everyone regained their composure and began to calmly deal with the
            situation. Sir Lot let out a sigh of relief. Now that the
            encirclement was formed, even the wicked demon seemed to have its
            momentum broken for a moment.
          </p>
          <p>“Good, we hold it here while waiting for the commander.”</p>
          <p>
            Stepping forward with sword and shield, Sir Lot continued. Though
            they had managed to halt its advance, Sephiatan was a high-tier
            demon, one that usually only those with significant aura abilities
            could confront. A direct assault would mean considerable casualties.
            Waiting for Graim’s Golden Knight seemed to be the best course of
            action.
          </p>
          <p>
            That was when it happened. One of the knights, forming part of the
            encirclement, suddenly disobeyed the command and charged towards
            Sephiatan.
          </p>
          <p>“Darn it!”</p>
          <p>
            The knight was a young man in his late twenties. Sir Lot shouted in
            dismay.
          </p>

          <p>“What are you doing, Russ!”</p>
          <p>
            As if he hadn’t heard, the young knight reached right in front of
            Sephiatan. Discarding his shield, the knight known as Russ gripped
            his bastard sword with both hands. A murderous shout erupted.
          </p>
          <p>“Evil demon! No one stands against the sword of Tenes!”</p>
          <p>Russ leaped, striking Sephiatan’s torso with a long slash.</p>
          <p>“Taaah!”</p>
          <p>
            It was a flash-like strike. The demon’s chest was split open, black
            blood spurting out. That a mere youth could inflict such a wound on
            Sephiatan, said to be a match only for aura wielders, showed how
            close to perfection Russ’s swordsmanship was. It was an artistic
            downward slash that would not have been out of place even if called
            a master’s swordsmanship.
          </p>
          <p>But that was all there was to it.</p>
          <p>“Kraaah!”</p>
          <p>
            In the midst of pain, Sephiatan immediately counterattacked. The
            broadsword, filled with flames, was swiftly brought down towards
            Russ. Russ tried to dodge in any way possible, but his movements
            were awkward. His skill in striking down was masterful, but beyond
            that, his abilities were utterly mediocre. Unable to dodge, he was
            squarely beaten.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            His armor shattered, sending Russ flying through the air. Blood
            burst from various parts of his body. Sir Lot clicked his tongue as
            he saw Russ crash into the dirt ground.
          </p>
          <p>“What a foolish man!”</p>
          <p>
            Sephiatan pointed his sword at the fallen Russ, with flames
            flickering as if they were about to pour out any moment. A priest of
            Aerius moved to save him, but Sir Lot immediately stopped him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We must not break this siege now! There’s no need to care for such
            a foolish person!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ spat out blood, his expression filled with humiliation.
            Sephiatan then shot the flames. Just as Russ was about to be
            enveloped in the red blaze,
          </p>
          <p>“The Blade of the Sky, tear through the void!”</p>
          <p>
            With a powerful shout, a blade of wind flew, splitting the blaze in
            half. The flaming spear that was flying towards him was quartered
            and scattered in all directions. At the same time, a robust young
            man landed in front of Russ, flying through the air. The young man,
            wearing the elegant attire of a noble, held a giant zanbatō nearly 2
            meters long in one hand.
          </p>
          <p>The Knights of Tenes erupted in cheers.</p>
          <p>“Lord Eusus!”</p>
          <p>“The commander has arrived!”</p>
          <p>
            Holding the zanbatō, Eusus turned around. Russ, bleeding, struggled
            to lift his head. A cold voice flowed from Eusus’s lips.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Fool! Did you think you were capable of facing an opponent with
            nothing but a downward strike?”
          </p>
          <p>Russ mumbled with blood dripping from his mouth.</p>
          <p>“Bro, brother…”</p>
          <p>“Who said I was your brother?”</p>
          <p>Contempt filled Eusus’s eyes in an instant.</p>
          <p>
            “A great knight of Tenes does not emerge from the loins of filthy
            strays!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus then turned his back on Russ. Russ gritted his teeth in
            humiliation.
          </p>
          <p>“Grr…”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 49 ]</p>
          <p>
            As Eusus appeared, everyone retreated, creating a circle around him
            to provide enough space for the fight. He muttered as he looked up
            at Sephiatan, gripping the hilt of his sword.
          </p>
          <p>“A demon that can only be confronted by an Aura User…”</p>
          <p>
            He was not an Aura User. Eusus had never learned how to awaken Aura.
            His family, the County of Tenes, had been renowned for their
            knighthood for centuries. However, despite their fame, the County of
            Tenes no longer possessed the formalized swordsmanship that led to
            the awakening of Aura. It had almost been lost during the civil war
            within the Graim Kingdom about a hundred years ago.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, he was as strong as an Aura User, thanks to the weapon he now
            held.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eusus’s weapon, the golden magic sword, was wrapped in a complexly
            shaped scabbard. Its form, adorned with countless bumps and dozens
            of interlocking pieces, looked more like a bizarre sculpture than a
            scabbard. As Eusus held the sword, he pronounced an incantation.
          </p>
          <p>“Awaken, Eldrad!”</p>
          <p>
            The scabbard exploded, transforming into dozens of golden tendrils
            that wrapped around Eusus’s body. The metal fragments entangled in
            the tendrils intricately rearranged themselves into another form.
            Soon, the scabbard disappeared, and instead, a dazzling golden
            armor, the strongest artifact from the Age of Silver, the magic
            armor Eldrad, was draped over Eusus’s body.
          </p>
          <p>
            The magic sword, now called Eldran, revealed its brilliant golden
            blade as the scabbard vanished. Eusus pulled Eldran from the ground
            and took his stance, easily wielding the giant sword with one hand.
            This display of strength was clearly beyond human limits, empowered
            by the muscle enhancement spell cast by Eldrad.
          </p>
          <p>“Come forth, demon of another world!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus proclaimed with a solemn voice, radiating a splendid light.
            Sephiatan, enraged, stamped its four feet on the ground. With a
            fearsome momentum like a lion stalking its prey, the demon charged
            towards Eusus. In an instant, Eusus kicked off the ground and soared
            into the air.
          </p>
          <p>“I shall become a feather riding the wind!”</p>
          <p>
            A broadsword swung horizontally towards the soaring Eusus. He kicked
            through the air, sidestepping in midair. He activated the magic of
            Wind Walk granted by Eldrad, using the air as a foothold. Then, as
            he swung down his magic sword, Eusus yelled.
          </p>
          <p>“Awaken, Eldran!”</p>
          <p>
            A sharp energy rose above the blade, glowing brightly. Unlike the
            Aura Users, it was faint, but its destructive power was second to
            none.
          </p>
          <p>“Taah!”</p>
          <p>
            Eusus activated the 8th Circle Material Destruction Spell, “Material
            Destroy,” and struck down with his demonic sword. Sephiatan crossed
            his broadswords to block the attack. Flames and magic collided,
            causing a loud explosion. Sparks flew in every direction, setting
            various parts of the garden ablaze. The demon twisted the crossed
            swords upwards to bend them. Eusus dodged swiftly, continuously
            shouting.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Eye of the Reaper, piercing the shadows, and the cry of the
            leopard, dwelling in the limbs! With the sense of a dragon, I shall
            look down upon the world!”
          </p>

          <p>
            Increased dynamic vision, reflexes, and hyper-sensory perception
            occurred simultaneously. Eusus, with enhancement magic cast all over
            his body, skillfully dodged Sephiatan’s incoming blade and burrowed
            into his bosom. His movements were comparable to those of an Aura
            ability user.
          </p>
          <p>
            Normally, when magic swordsmen fight with enhancement magic, their
            movements become exaggerated because their physical performance,
            heightened by their spells, can’t keep up. Although stronger, their
            actions become full of openings. However, Eusus, despite casting
            powerful magic in succession, moved without any unnecessary motions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Confused, Sephiatan swung his front limbs, but Eusus avoided every
            attack by kicking off the ground and the air alternately. The golden
            sword began to leave wounds all over the demon.
          </p>
          <p>“Gruah! Graaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Failing to hit his opponent despite repeated strikes, Sephiatan let
            out a scream filled with humiliation. Eusus declared in a cold
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s end this, demon!”</p>
          <p>
            Continuously stepping, he placed his right hand on the blade of his
            demonic sword.
          </p>
          <p>“Breath of Corrosion, flowing through the void!”</p>
          <p>
            The magic sword Eldran started to emit a dark green mist. The smoke
            of the acid fog hazily enveloped Sephiatan. The two broadswords
            began to corrode, and the demon’s skin melted away, causing black
            smoke to rise.
          </p>
          <p>“Blaze, coalesce and strike the enemy!”</p>
          <p>
            Dozens of fireballs formed behind Eusus and struck the demon. The
            fierce flames scorched the demon’s already injured body. Sephiatan
            screamed in pain and thrashed about.
          </p>
          <p>“Graaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Raising his right hand, Eusus continued with his magic. The magic
            armor Eldrad was covered with a dazzling pattern of magic circles,
            shining brightly.
          </p>
          <p>“Frost Mist, obscuring the earth!”</p>
          <p>
            Spraying white frost, Eusus swung his sword, enveloping the demon in
            a mist of cold. With the onslaught of acid, flame, and frost
            attacks, Sephiatan’s movements noticeably slowed down. Eusus kicked
            off the air and soared up to the demon’s head. Wielding Eldran, he
            delivered the final blow.
          </p>
          <p>“Disappear!”</p>
          <p>
            The demon’s upper body shattered, scattering in all directions. The
            demon’s screams filled Kelberen Castle.
          </p>
          <p>“Graaah!”</p>
          <p>Woosh…</p>

          <p>
            With the tremor-filled roar, the figure of Sephiatan gradually
            became blurred. It was the summoned demon disappearing back to its
            own realm. Eventually, its form vanished completely, and the statue,
            which had been a relic, began to shake on its own before crumbling
            away. As Sephiatan died, the statue seemed to have lost its magical
            power as well.
          </p>
          <p>Eusus flashed a satisfied smile.</p>
          <p>
            “Ha! Did you think a demon would stand a chance against the Sword of
            Tenes?”
          </p>
          <p>Everyone showered Eusus with praise, marveling at his prowess.</p>
          <p>“Well done, Sir Eusus!”</p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, before the power of the Golden Knight, even a demon like
            Sephiatan is no match!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s all tidy up the situation! Lord Lot, please take care of it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After giving orders for the cleanup, Eusus transformed his armor
            back into the form of a scabbard. All those in the garden looked
            upon his retreating figure with eyes of admiration, all except for
            one.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it…”</p>
          <p>
            The reckless young knight, Russ, who was lying down receiving
            healing magic, glared at Eusus’s back with burning eyes. Feeling the
            gaze, Eusus suddenly turned to look at Russ. With a cold glare,
            Eusus taunted him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “A trash swordsmanship that only knows how to swing downwards is no
            longer the Sword of Tenes. Know your place, Russ.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ’s head drooped. However, Eusus did not care. He simply slung
            his greatsword over his shoulder and returned to the mansion. Russ’s
            shoulders shook as he felt the utter contempt and disregard.
          </p>
          <p>“This too is the Sword of Tenes…”</p>
          <p>
            Clenching his bastard sword tightly, he muttered with a face about
            to cry.
          </p>
          <p>“I, too, am a Sword of Tenes…”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“Really? So the Golden Knight of this era is Sir Eusus.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, he’s very famous. Didn’t you know?”</p>

          <p>“Ah, I’ve lived in the mountains all my life…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his head, making an excuse. In his past life,
            when he had roamed the world, the Tenes County was famous for a
            different reason, so the renown of the Golden Knight was not widely
            known. Sitting on the bed and swinging his legs, Sillan continued
            the conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But still, haven’t you really heard of him? He’s one of the
            strongest magic swordsmen on the continent, said to be on par with
            Aura wielders.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, Repenhardt and his companions were spending the night at
            the inn where they had eaten. Since it was getting late, they had
            decided to stay in the village of Gehallen for the night. Being a
            rural inn, the facilities were not very good; there was just one
            large room with four beds in it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt spoke towards a corner of the room where the curtains
            were drawn.
          </p>
          <p>“Is he that famous? Have you heard of him, Siris?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            Pulling back the curtain, Siris responded, having changed clothes in
            a makeshift changing room specially prepared by Repenhardt. It was
            clear that Repenhardt had no intention of letting an outsider, even
            Sillan, who was a man, witness the sight of his beloved Siris
            changing.
          </p>
          <p>“The pajamas look nice. How do they fit?”</p>
          <p>“Ah, yes……”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt chuckled as he saw Siris dressed in bear pajamas. It
            seemed he found the sight pleasing. Siris, feeling awkward, sat down
            on the bed across from him. Repenhardt waited for her to continue,
            but she simply nodded in response before closing her mouth again.
          </p>
          <p>‘Tsk… it’s not easy.’</p>
          <p>
            Despite his attempts to strike up conversation whenever an
            opportunity arose, her attitude remained largely unchanged. It
            appeared she wasn’t yet ready to open up and converse naturally with
            him.
          </p>
          <p>Then, the oblivious Sillan continued the conversation.</p>
          <p>
            “No matter how strong, I don’t think a magic swordsman can compare
            to an aura user. After all, isn’t it just the power of a magical
            artifact?”
          </p>
          <p>
            His tone didn’t seem to hold much regard for Eusus, reflecting the
            common perception. It was typical to belittle magic swordsmen, who
            rely on the power of magic, compared to true warriors.
          </p>
          <p>However, Repenhardt, who was also a magician, disagreed.</p>
          <p>
            “Well? The magic armor Eldrad, made of Eldril by the great Eldrad
            himself, is certainly one of the strongest weapons of our time. But
            how skillfully one can wield it is another matter entirely.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Eldril, true gold, a magical metal far rarer and more powerful than
            Mithril, true silver.
          </p>
          <p>
            The magic armor Eldrad and the magic sword Eldran, passed down
            through generations of the Count family of Tenes, were artifacts
            made entirely of this true gold Eldril, ranking among the strongest
            artifacts from the Silver Age. Although Repenhardt didn’t know who
            the Golden Knight of the current era was, he was well aware of the
            existence of the magic swordsman who wields Eldrad, a legacy of the
            Count’s family of Tenes throughout the generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            This artifact, covered in powerful protective magic and capable of
            unleashing powerful magic with a simple command word, undoubtedly
            granted its wearer combat abilities on par with an aura wielder.
            That is, if they could properly utilize it.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No matter how powerful a tool is, it’s no more than a decoration if
            you don’t know how to use it.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Having created various magical tools in his previous life and
            distributed them among his subordinates, he was well aware of this
            fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, an artifact is merely a tool, and its effectiveness
            greatly varies depending on how skillfully the user can wield it.

          <p>[ Chapter 50 ]</p>
          <p>Repenhardt muttered with a perplexed look on his face.</p>
          <p>
            “Using Eldrad as a magic swordsman, huh… This is going to be
            tricky.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t that he had never fought against Aura users before.
            However, there was a distinct difference between Aura wielders who
            had fallen into sloth, neglecting their training, and a magic
            swordsman who, despite not having awakened his Aura, had put his all
            into making the best of his situation through relentless effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            After some thought, Repenhardt couldn’t help but give the latter
            more credit.
          </p>
          <p>“… Can I win?”</p>
          <p>At his murmuring, Sillan asked in surprise.</p>
          <p>
            “Huh? Mr. Repen, you’re not thinking of fighting with the Count of
            Tenes, are you?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt nodded as if it were obvious.</p>
          <p>“We have to retrieve the relics they took.”</p>
          <p>Sillan’s expression hardened. He asked again, disbelieving.</p>
          <p>“Are you saying you’re going to steal?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt, with a blank look on his face, replied.</p>
          <p>“Steal?”</p>
          <p>He looked utterly baffled by Sillan’s question.</p>
          <p>“Hold on, Mr. Repen.”</p>
          <p>
            After a moment of consideration, Sillan spoke in a serious tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In the Principality of Chatan, I agreed with you because I thought
            you were right. But this doesn’t seem right. They explored the ruins
            through legitimate means and took the relics as their due. That
            makes them the rightful owners of those relics. Taking the relics
            from them would be theft, wouldn’t it?”
          </p>
          <p>“Uh…”</p>
          <p>
            It was then that Repenhardt finally grasped the situation. From his
            perspective, Elucion was a ruin he had explored and unearthed
            himself. Naturally, he strongly believed the relics were his. But in
            this time period, the relics were indeed rightfully owned by the
            Count of Tenes. Sillan’s words were irrefutably accurate.
          </p>
          <p>“Is it theft, then?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan looked incredulous at Repenhardt’s naive question. Did this
            gentleman really not realize that before?
          </p>
          <p>“Umm…”</p>

          <p>
            Repenhardt, finding himself in a bind, scratched his head while
            Sillan tried to soothe him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There, there, I understand it’s hard to let go, but we can give up
            on this. We can just find another ruin, right? I still have plenty
            of money. It’s enough to cover our travel expenses for a while, so
            there’s no need to rush.” e
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan thought Repenhardt was being hasty because he was running out
            of money. Of course, the truth was entirely different.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ugh, how do I explain this?’</p>
          <p>
            Without being able to talk about his past life, Repenhardt found it
            impossible to argue against Sillan’s point. Nor could he just
            brazenly proceed with theft without a convincing reason. If he acted
            so recklessly without justification, Sillan, disappointed, would
            surely leave him.
          </p>
          <p>‘I don’t want that…’</p>
          <p>
            Although Repenhardt joked about having a top-quality medicine
            bottle, he genuinely acknowledged Sillan as a comrade. He was
            impressed by Sillan’s abilities and personality. Repenhardt also
            thought that he should explain everything properly when the
            opportunity arose.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it wasn’t yet time to discuss his past life. His words
            would carry more weight after he regained his magical powers, but
            for now, he feared he would be treated as if he were insane.
          </p>
          <p>‘How can I persuade him without mentioning my past life?’</p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt was pondering this, an idea suddenly came to him. He
            put on a serious face and turned to Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sillan, as a fellow comrade, I feel I should tell you something.”
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? What is it?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt swallowed before speaking. The story he was about to tell
            required a bit of preparation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Did I mention that my martial arts school is called Gym
            Unbreakable?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yes, you told me about being a disciple of the Fist King, Gerard.
            I’ve already heard about it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Given Sillan’s peculiar fascination (?) with muscles, it was
            impossible for him to not know about Gerard, the legendary boxer
            touted as having the most muscular physique in the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But, to pass through our school’s teachings, there are a few
            trials, you see?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt continued calmly.</p>
          <p>
            He was a disciple of Fist King Gerard and the current successor of
            Gym Unbreakable. This martial arts school had a tradition of putting
            its disciples through rigorous tests, and even after leaving the
            mountain, Gerard couldn’t bear to see his disciples idle. Therefore,
            he too had several tests to pass, as part of his duty as a disciple.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, one of these tests involved your master, Fist King Gerard,
            placing one of Gym Unbreakable’s artifacts inside the Elucion ruins
            and asking to retrieve it as part of the trial?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yes, it’s a tradition in our school to toughen up the disciples.”
          </p>
          <p>“The final test, you mean…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan looked suspiciously at Repenhardt. It was fairly common for
            martial arts schools to test the abilities of their departing
            disciples by having them pass through a specially prepared trial, so
            the fact that Gym Unbreakable had such a test wasn’t surprising.
            However…
          </p>

          <p>
            “Choosing an actual dungeon as the test site is something I’ve never
            heard of before.”
          </p>
          <p>“Our school is a bit old-fashioned in that regard.”</p>
          <p>
            Trying to appear calm, Repenhardt licked his lips again. Since he
            hadn’t reached the point where he could lie effortlessly without
            moistening his lips, his mouth kept drying out.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan nodded with an ambiguous expression.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, from what I’ve heard, it does seem like they put their
            disciples through a lot.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan had already heard in detail about the kind of training
            Repenhardt had undergone. Even Sillan, who harbored an infinite
            admiration for muscles, was horrified by the foolishness of the
            training method. It made sense, then, that the final test was so
            brutally unreasonable.
          </p>
          <p>However, there were still doubts lingering.</p>
          <p>
            “But, you said Master Gerard had already explored the Elucion ruins
            once, right? He didn’t touch a single artifact from the Silver Age
            inside the ruins?”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was indeed strange to leave those valuable artifacts untouched
            after a proper dungeon exploration. But Repenhardt responded
            naturally again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The other artifacts obtained during that were meant as rewards for
            disciples who passed the test.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed lying was becoming second nature. Repenhardt added that
            the information about the Elucion ruins was not known to the world,
            only to Gerard, so his master had not anticipated someone else
            taking action first.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Think about it. How could I have recognized Nihillen if I hadn’t
            been told beforehand?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah… now that you mention it…”</p>
          <p>Sillan seemed to have realized something.</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had immediately recognized Nihillen, which looked like a
            mere piece of wood. Considering that even the wizards of the Tenes
            County had discarded the artifact without recognizing its identity,
            it was unbelievable that he, a mere martial artist, could identify
            it. However, it made sense if his master had hinted at it
            beforehand.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yes, Nihillen is originally one of our martial sect’s weapons. He
            left it there so I would recognize it. And you saw how I found the
            shortcut, right? If that really was an unexcavated ruin, how could I
            have known about it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt used Nihillen and the direct back route to the core of
            the Elucion ruins as evidence to convince Sillan. Indeed, even if
            Nihillen could be explained away, the secret passage leading
            directly to the core was information that could not be known without
            fully exploring the ruins. By this point, Sillan couldn’t help but
            believe him.
          </p>
          <p>“If that’s the reason, I can understand Mr. Repen’s attitude.”</p>
          <p>
            As it was said, the artifact rightfully belonged to Repenhardt,
            precisely to Gym Unbreakable, so it made sense that there was no
            awareness of theft.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Indeed, it didn’t seem characteristic of Mr. Repen to covet others’
            belongings, even if the relics of the Silver Age are valuable. I did
            find it odd because it’s not in your nature to desire someone else’s
            possessions.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Then, under normal circumstances, I wouldn’t cling to this
            situation; I would just look for another dungeon, right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt actively agreed, which made it easier for Sillan to come
            to terms with the situation.
          </p>
          <p>“There’s no helping it then. I understand.”</p>

          <p>
            Sillan completely dropped his suspicions and nodded. With the
            evidence this clear, there was no room for doubt. Repenhardt sighed
            in relief and smiled wryly.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m sorry, Sillan. But it’s not all a lie, at least.”</p>
          <p>Sillan, with a serious look, asked Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>“So, Mr. Repen, you must retrieve that artifact at all costs?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, that’s what worries me.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan’s expression hardened. He understood Repenhardt’s stance, but
            the fact remained that the artifact was legally owned by the Count
            of Tenes.
          </p>
          <p>After a moment of thought, Sillan asked out of the blue.</p>
          <p>
            “What will you do then? Go and tell the truth to get only that
            artifact back?”
          </p>
          <p>“Do you think someone would believe what I just said?”</p>
          <p>“It’s unlikely.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan thought it over; if someone went through the trouble of
            dungeon delving to acquire an artifact, only for a stranger to
            claim, “One of those is originally mine. Hand it over,” they would
            be viewed as nothing less than a bandit.
          </p>
          <p>“What about buying it with a proper price?”</p>
          <p>“I’ve thought about that too, but it seems too difficult.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt shook his head.</p>
          <p>
            The relics of the Silver Age were all traded at high prices.
            Moreover, the relic that Repenhardt sought, the Voice of Elucion,
            was currently known how to be used only by Repenhardt himself. Even
            Repenhardt, who had been a great sorcerer, had to research for years
            to find out how to use that relic, so it was impossible for the
            sorcerers of the Tenes family to immediately understand its purpose.
            And before even figuring out how to use it, it was unlikely they
            would be foolish enough to hand over a Silver Age relic to someone
            else.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sillan, think about it. You have a relic from the Silver Age in
            your hand, and you don’t know how to use it. Then someone asks you
            to sell it. Can you sell it, not even knowing what it is, and when
            it might be of help to you? Especially when the Tenes family isn’t a
            poor house in urgent need of money. It might take years, you know?”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan nodded. Despite appearances, Sillan was quite knowledgeable
            about the world. He had to admit that there was no peaceful way for
            Repenhardt to obtain that relic.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>
            “This is really twisted, isn’t it? Looks like there’s no way but to
            steal it?”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s the situation now.”</p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan scratched his cheek with a sullen face. As a cleric, he
            didn’t want to be involved in theft, but the situation was
            understandable, so he couldn’t keep opposing it. After all, it was
            about reclaiming what was theirs, so it couldn’t exactly be called
            theft. However, since the Tenes family hadn’t maliciously stolen
            Repenhardt’s belongings, it was also ambiguous to say it wasn’t
            theft…
          </p>
          <p>
            After being troubled, Sillan suddenly looked determined at
            Repenhardt. He asked as if to drive the point home.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, the only thing Mr. Repen needs is that relic? You’re not
            touching anything else, right?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t need anything else. You understand that I’m not doing this
            out of greed for money, don’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s confident response made Sillan firm his resolve. Among
            the countless relics, just one didn’t seem like it would cause much
            trouble. Sillan sighed and then smirked bitterly before speaking.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright. So, what’s the plan now?”</p>
