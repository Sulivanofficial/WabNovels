          <p>[ Chapter 111 ]</p>
          <p>Tilla, unfortunately, had been defeated.</p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t due to a lack of skill on her part. In the beginning,
            Tilla had matched the orc warrior blow for blow, demonstrating her
            exceptional prowess. The problem began when the orc warrior started
            using a Spirits Weapon.
          </p>
          <p>
            The opponent Tilla faced wielded a massive hammer. His strategy
            involved pressuring his opponent with martial arts and then
            delivering a lethal strike with the hammer whenever he found an
            opening.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the orc warrior began to draw out the spirit within the hammer,
            the situation changed. The hammer, moving on its own, combined with
            the orc’s unarmed martial arts, overwhelmed Tilla.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Siris possessed the technical skills to handle attacks from
            multiple directions, Tilla’s strategy, which relied on overpowering
            her opponent before they could utilize their techniques, was less
            effective.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the current Ritual of Hotu was not a life-or-death battle
            but a duel to test their skills, which put Tilla at a disadvantage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tilla was the “only” warrior of the Steel Hammer clan, meaning she
            had always trained alone without peers to spar with.
          </p>
          <p>
            After meeting Repenhardt, Tilla had numerous bouts with Siris and
            fought other dwarf warriors in the Grand Forge, becoming more
            accustomed to fighting others. However, she still hadn’t mastered
            controlling her attacks perfectly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply put, she couldn’t swing her axe with full power for fear of
            killing her opponent. Siris, with over fifty years of experience
            against various foes, could stop her sword right at the vital point,
            but Tilla, whose strength far exceeded her skill, could not
            replicate such a feat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Tilla had to swing her axe with only about half her strength,
            always ready to halt her attack. She couldn’t even use the power of
            Earth Resonance. There was no point in multiplying her power tenfold
            if she couldn’t control it. Besides, she couldn’t risk splitting her
            opponent in two when the goal was to foster camaraderie.
          </p>
          <p>
            In truth, the orcs would have celebrated even if one of their kin
            was split in half, as long as it was the result of a “fair” duel.
            That’s just the kind of people they were.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Tilla didn’t know that, and even if she did, it wasn’t in her
            nature to act that way. In the end, she had to concede defeat.
          </p>
          <p>“I… lost…”</p>
          <p>
            The orc warrior, having put away his hammer, let out a victorious
            roar. Stalla raised her hand, declaring the Blue Bear Tribe’s
            victory. She then looked at the dejected Tilla and gave her a gentle
            smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Dwarf woman, you are an exceptional warrior, but you are not yet
            complete. Holding back your full strength is an insult to your
            opponent, though I understand that was not your intention.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla, with her keen insight, had already seen through why Tilla
            had not fought with all her might. She continued in a stern voice,
            as if scolding her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is not a fight to the death, so it was wise of you to gauge
            your skills and only use what you could handle. That is the mark of
            a true warrior. However, dwarf woman, it seems you lack the
            discernment to accurately judge your opponent’s abilities. Even if
            you had used your full strength, the warriors of the Blue Bear Tribe
            would have been able to handle it. This shows a lack of insight on
            your part, which you must work to improve.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At Stalla’s solemn words, Tilla lowered her head in silence. She
            then trudged back to her companions and asked,
          </p>
          <p>“…What did she say?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt couldn’t help but let out a wry smile. Stalla had indeed
            given some wise advice, but the problem was she had done so in
            Orcish. How could Tilla possibly understand?
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt gave a rough summary.</p>
          <p>
            “She said it’s good that you understood your limits, but you didn’t
            need to.”
          </p>
          <p>“…What?”</p>
          <p>
            It seemed he had summarized too much. Tilla tilted her head in
            confusion. But Repenhardt, too lazy to explain further, simply waved
            his hand dismissively.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, anyway, you got recognition, so it’s fine.”</p>

          <p>
            Despite her defeat, Tilla’s powerful strikes had left a deep
            impression on the orc warriors. They all acknowledged her as an
            excellent and trustworthy warrior and cheered for her.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt patted Russ on the back, pushing him forward.</p>
          <p>“Now, it’s your turn. Don’t go overboard.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Nodding, Russ stepped into the clearing. Drawing his sword, he
            shouted in a hearty voice,
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am Cyrus von Tenes, inheritor of the Tenes sword! I stand here to
            prove the worth of a warrior!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ’s chivalrous demeanor earned cheers from the orcs, while
            Repenhardt’s group couldn’t help but cringe at his grandiosity. Even
            Stalla, being an orc herself, seemed to appreciate Russ’s attitude,
            showing a favorable expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            As before, Stalla scrutinized Russ to gauge his abilities and select
            a suitable opponent. Orc warriors eagerly awaited her choice,
            craning their necks in anticipation. Suddenly, Stalla’s expression
            hardened.
          </p>
          <p>Gazing at Russ, she let out an exclamation of admiration.</p>
          <p>“Karuga!”</p>
          <p>
            It was an orcish word meaning warrior. Suddenly, Stalla extended her
            left hand to the side. The orc warriors, who had been about to
            charge forward, flinched and looked at their matriarch. They were
            all surprised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla, who was always calm, had eyes that gleamed red. Her eyes
            were filled with excitement, anticipating the battle.
          </p>
          <p>“I will face this one myself!”</p>
          <p>
            Stepping forward, Stalla burst into laughter. The orc warriors
            murmured in confusion.
          </p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>“Why would the matriarch fight directly?”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla pulled back her hood and revealed her face, smiling like a
            beast.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This one is Karuga, a warrior! Blessed by the great spirit Debata!”
          </p>
          <p>A warrior blessed by the spirit, Karuga.</p>
          <p>
            This was an orc-specific expression referring to a warrior who had
            awakened their aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orcs who reached the level of drawing out the spirit of their weapon
            were called warriors. Among these warriors, those who awakened their
            aura were called Karuga, reigning above other warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            In ancient times, there was a position called Taikaruga, a grand
            warrior who ruled the entire orc tribe with the recognition of all
            warriors. However, in the current era, where most tribes barely
            survived in remote areas, this was a legendary tale. Thus, the title
            of Karuga was the highest honor for the greatest warrior among orcs
            in this era.
          </p>
          <p>Stalla Langar Beta.</p>
          <p>
            She was one of the only two orcs in the Blue Bear Tribe who held the
            title of Karuga. She was the strongest warrior, receiving the
            respect and reverence of all orcs.
          </p>
          <p>
            For her to now call a human a Karuga? The orc warriors began to
            murmur, looking at Russ with eyes filled with awe.
          </p>
          <p>“Karuga!”</p>

          <p>“Karuga Klta Chaser!”</p>
          <p>
            Although Russ couldn’t understand the orcish language, he could
            sense from the atmosphere that the orcs were showing him
            considerable respect. He smirked wryly. He knew he wasn’t
            particularly humble…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If they’re this surprised by me, what will they do when they see
            hyung?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla, having removed her hood, walked out into the open space.
            Seeing her face, Russ was momentarily taken aback.
          </p>
          <p>‘Wait, she’s a woman?’</p>
          <p>
            The intimidation she exuded had made Russ assume she was a man.
            Although he acknowledged the skills of women like Siris and Tilla,
            as a knight, he couldn’t entirely shake off the notion that women
            were weaker beings needing protection.
          </p>
          <p>‘Do I have to draw my sword against a woman?’</p>
          <p>
            Feeling awkward, Russ reluctantly drew his sword. As he did, Stalla,
            who had approached closer, threw off her cloak!
          </p>
          <p>Whirl!</p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s entire body was vividly exposed under the sun of the
            wilderness. And Russ was momentarily thrown into confusion.
          </p>
          <p>‘…A woman?’</p>
          <p>Something seemed off.</p>
          <p>
            No, she was definitely a woman, but… those burly biceps, triceps,
            and thigh muscles were truly unsettling. No, typically, body fat
            should be evenly distributed, but how could that orc woman have such
            a prominent six-pack and still maintain such a full chest? Was it a
            characteristic of the orc race? He glanced at the other orcs, but
            seeing some of the warriors with relatively smooth bellies, it
            didn’t seem to be a universal trait.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Russ stood there in disbelief, Stalla drew her cherished weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her weapons were two daggers, about 40 centimeters long each. Most
            orcs believed that “the bigger the weapon, the more beautiful it
            is,” but she uniquely favored short weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gripping her two daggers and assuming a stance, Stalla shouted in
            the common tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Mother of the Blue Bear Tribe, warrior Stalla! I challenge you!”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Wooong!</p>
          <p>
            With a loud noise, Russ’s longsword was enveloped in a blue light.
            The purest light of destruction, Blade Aura, shone brilliantly over
            the wilderness ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s dual daggers also emitted Blade Aura. The bluish-purple
            aura wrapped around the blades, glowing dazzlingly.
          </p>
          <p>Wooong! Wooong!</p>
          <p>
            The fighting spirit flared up, heating the air between Russ and
            Stalla. The flow of energy tore through the air, creating a faint
            noise. Russ’s gaze became intense. They just assumed their stances
            and glared at each other…
          </p>
          <p>‘Strong!’</p>
          <p>
            The aura emanating from Stalla was astonishing. The terrifying
            energy silently ensnared his entire body. It was as if he was
            submerged in icy water, his whole body constantly sounding a danger
            alarm. The thoughts of her being a woman or an orc were no longer in
            his mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The orc woman before him was the first formidable opponent he had
            encountered since Repenhardt! Her presence was even more formidable
            than the Dwarven Aura users of the Grand Forge!
          </p>

          <p>‘I can’t be outdone in momentum!’</p>
          <p>
            The tip of Russ’s sword trembled slightly. Stalla’s dual daggers
            quivered minutely.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a prolonged shout, Russ took the initiative. He closed the
            4-meter distance and swung his sword long. The blue aura extended
            like a whip, lashing at Stalla’s legs.
          </p>
          <p>“Haha!”</p>
          <p>With a burst of laughter, Stalla kicked off the ground.</p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            A thunderous sound erupted as dust exploded from the spot she had
            kicked. Using her tremendous leg strength, Stalla flew straight
            towards Russ.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two daggers, imbued with bluish-purple aura, darted around
            Russ’s field of vision, creating a chaotic display. With complex
            trajectories, Stalla relentlessly stabbed at Russ’s vital points.
            Instead of counterattacking, Russ twisted his body to avoid fatal
            wounds and thrust his sword at Stalla’s chest. Rather than parrying
            each attack, he opted to deliver a decisive strike, forcing her to
            retreat. It was an embodiment of the principle that the best defense
            is a good offense.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh? You’re clever!”</p>
          <p>
            Ignoring the incoming attacks to counterstrike instead was something
            only a seasoned warrior could pull off. Impressed, Stalla quickly
            retracted her attack and crossed her daggers to guard her chest. The
            blue Blade Aura clashed with the two streams of bluish-purple aura,
            creating a powerful shockwave in the air.
          </p>
          <p>Zzeong!</p>
          <p>
            The thunderous sound of the collision spread the shockwave in all
            directions, tearing up the ground and heating the air. Blades
            clashed repeatedly, sending out continuous ripples. The intense
            remnants of destruction fervently plowed the unfortunate wilderness
            ground.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaah!”</p>
          <p>“Krararara!”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla and Russ exchanged dozens of fierce strikes. In terms of
            skill and aura, Stalla was clearly superior. However, Russ, whose
            talent was unparalleled under the heavens, covered his lack of
            experience and skill purely with instinct. Amazingly, he managed to
            hold his own against Stalla, maintaining a stalemate.
          </p>
          <p>Stalla’s face gradually showed more admiration.</p>
          <p>‘How interesting. How does he manage such attacks?’</p>
          <p>
            Russ’s sword was truly tricky to deal with. He would turn his back,
            only for his sword to suddenly come from the left. A downward slash
            would feel like it was striking from the side.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the “Russ’s signature free-form attack.” His unpredictable
            swordplay, unbound by martial theory, continuously struck from
            unexpected angles, keeping Stalla on the defensive while preventing
            her from landing a decisive blow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, it was an exhilarating fight. Since receiving the
            Blessing of the Fighting Spirit, this was the first time she had
            encountered an opponent who gave her such a thrill. Excited, Stalla
            opened her mouth to praise Russ.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your talent is amazing, young one! But you still lack experience!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Only after speaking did she remember that her opponent didn’t
            understand Orcish. Stalla dodged an attack and shouted again in the
            common tongue.
          </p>
          <p>“You are good! But I am old!”</p>
          <p>
            Saying it out loud, she realized it didn’t come out quite right. She
            sighed inwardly.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ugh, that’s not what I meant to say.’</p>
          <p>
            There was nothing she could do. No matter how wise Stalla was, she
            was still an orc. Despite having the language of sages in her mind,
            her orcish tongue and vocal cords could only produce simple common
            speech.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
          <p>
            As expected, Russ was bewildered. Smiling wryly, Stalla continued.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s a compliment!”</p>
          <p>“…?”</p>
          <p>“Forget it! Let’s just fight!”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 112 ]</p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s daggers danced elegantly. Russ’s longsword moved smoothly
            in a matching trajectory. The swords intertwined in a spectacular
            display, the two of them performing a dance of blades in this
            desolate ballroom of the wilderness.
          </p>
          <p>
            How long had they fought so frantically? Both began to realize that
            they couldn’t go on like this. Countless sword strikes had been
            exchanged, yet neither had managed to wound the other. Only the
            unfortunate wasteland had been plowed enthusiastically like a barley
            field in spring.
          </p>
          <p>‘I guess I’ll have to show my hand.’</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Stalla threw her daggers into the air. She shouted,
            “Sethea! Randart!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Calling the names of her cherished weapons, she awakened the spirits
            within the daggers. The bluish-purple aura transformed into a pure
            violet light, halting mid-air.
          </p>
          <p>
            With that, Stalla spread her palms and assumed a martial stance.
          </p>
          <p>Whirrrrr!</p>
          <p>
            Auras extended from her hands, forming long blades. She bared her
            teeth in a fierce grin.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go, my sisters!”</p>
          <p>
            The violet daggers flew through the air, shooting towards Russ from
            the left and right like arrows.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The two daggers, imbued with a menacing energy, flew at him from
            both sides. Even without looking, he could feel their destructive
            force. Russ tightened his grip on his sword, his expression
            hardening.
          </p>
          <p>‘So this is what hyung talked about.’</p>
          <p>
            He had already seen this technique through Siris and Tilla, but
            facing it directly was a different experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ever since he became an aura user, he could usually grasp the
            technique just by observing. The Dwarves’ methods, the earth
            resonance, he couldn’t replicate due to different physiology, but he
            had long since understood the principles.
          </p>
          <p>But this technique was beyond comprehension!</p>
          <p>‘Good grief…’</p>
          <p>
            Russ made a bitter face. In truth, floating a sword in mid-air and
            manipulating it at will wasn’t a difficult task for an aura user. It
            was just a matter of overlaying the sword with aura and controlling
            it with willpower.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem was that it served no practical purpose. Who would focus
            on controlling a floating sword only to get stabbed? If a ranged
            attack was needed, simply hurling aura would suffice. There was no
            need to throw a sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this technique was different. As an aura user, Russ could
            tell for sure. There was no connection of energy between Stalla and
            her daggers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Stalla wasn’t controlling them. The daggers were truly flying on
            their own. Naturally, she had no distractions.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘As expected, it has nothing to do with aura, just as hyung said.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ widened his aura field, sensing the movements of the daggers,
            and furrowed his brows. He recalled Repenhardt’s recent explanation.
          </p>
          <p>
            -The orcs’ vision, Spirits Weapon, is said to communicate with the
            sword and awaken its soul. Well, that’s what they believe, anyway.
            My research showed something different.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Tilla was fighting, Repenhardt took the time to explain to
            Russ in detail about the orcs’ vision. They couldn’t afford to make
            the same mistake as during Siris’s time. Tilla had been sent out due
            to urgency, but Russ had ample time to prepare.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to the orcs’ belief, a mere tool couldn’t possibly have a
            soul. However, when the orc warriors activated the Spirits Weapon,
            the weapons indeed seemed to move on their own, as if alive.
            Repenhardt, a mage, had naturally researched this irrational
            phenomenon. During his time as the Emperor of the Antares Empire, he
            studied Tassid and other orc warriors, gaining significant insight
            into their vision.
          </p>
          <p>
            -It’s not exactly the soul of the sword, but rather the lingering
            thoughts of the orc warrior imbued into a weapon they have used for
            a long time. They project their consciousness over time, leaving
            residual thoughts, which in turn transform the weapon into a sort of
            semi-informational entity. It’s somewhat like artificial
            intelligence in magical terms. Although, compared to a mage’s
            creation, it’s quite simplistic.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a rational being harbors intense emotions or consciousness,
            they leave a trace in the flow of the world. This is known as
            residual thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Orcs are known to be one of the simplest species in the world, and
            their simple nature makes their thoughts intense. Their act of
            cherishing their weapons endows them with residual thoughts,
            resulting in the Spirits Weapon. They can even project their
            thoughts to tame beasts. That’s why orcs can tame fierce creatures
            like direwolves.
          </p>
          <p>
            The true racial characteristic of the orcs wasn’t merely making
            weapons fly. It was the ability to let their thoughts embedded in
            objects directly affect reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt trembled upon realizing the true power of the orcs
            through his research. If orcs fully understood what they were doing,
            they could move objects or control minds with mere thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, during his time in the Antares Empire, Repenhardt once
            gathered his subordinate orcs and taught them his theory, training
            them to consciously activate their thought power. He hoped to arm
            the orcs with incredible weapons.
          </p>
          <p>However, the result was a complete failure.</p>
          <p>
            The orcs’ thoughts indeed possessed physical power, but their effect
            was too insignificant. Only with prolonged and intense concentration
            could these thoughts barely affect the physical world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, thought power had to be focused until it took the
            form of residual thoughts for any physical results to manifest.
            Moreover, residual thoughts wouldn’t remain unless it was an object
            cherished with an almost obsessive affection. Realizing this
            limitation, Repenhardt had to abandon his experiments, disappointed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyway, Repenhardt couldn’t share his past life’s story with Russ.
            He only explained the practical parts.
          </p>
          <p>
            -The stronger the thought power imbued in a weapon, the more it
            moves as if it has a real life. For an aura user, it can almost be
            considered an extension of oneself. The more information contained
            in the residual thoughts, the more of one’s skills and experiences
            remain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sensing the movements of the flying daggers, Russ inwardly clicked
            his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            -Indeed, these movements are on a different level compared to the
            orcs we faced earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two daggers, imbued with aura, glided through the air like
            dancers, skillfully targeting Russ’s openings. Each attack was
            astonishingly precise and delicate. Despite being a pair of daggers,
            they were vastly different from what Jalkato had shown. It felt as
            if there were two invisible Stallas attacking in unison.
          </p>
          <p>-Ah, this is really troublesome.</p>

          <p>
            Gritting his teeth, Russ continuously dodged the attacks. He had no
            chance to counterattack. Stalla, who had thrown the daggers, wasn’t
            standing still either. She kept wielding her aura-filled hands,
            causing the ground to crack and the atmosphere to tremble.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Both the daggers and Stalla simultaneously extended three streaks of
            blade aura. The angles made it impossible to dodge. This time,
            instead of defending, Russ thrust his sword forward.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaat!”</p>
          <p>
            Just like before, instead of blocking each attack, he countered with
            his sword to force the opponent back. Stalla also withdrew her
            attack, crossing her arms defensively as she retreated. But this
            time, the outcome was different.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Stalla retreated, her daggers, Sethea and Randart, did not.
          </p>
          <p>Swish!</p>
          <p>
            With a chilling noise, a flash grazed Russ’s shoulder. He groaned,
            letting his right arm drop.
          </p>
          <p>Thud! Drip!</p>
          <p>
            Red blood dripped down his right arm. He managed to twist his body
            to avoid Sethea’s attack on the left, but couldn’t dodge Randart’s
            aura on the right. Luckily, his arm wasn’t severed, but it seemed a
            tendon was damaged, rendering it immobile.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            Holding his sword with just his left hand, Russ suppressed the pain,
            while Stalla let out a hearty cry.
          </p>
          <p>“My victory!”</p>
          <p>Russ’s eyes wavered.</p>
          <p>
            He had already long acknowledged that his opponent was superior. In
            terms of experience, skill, and aura power, Russ was no match for
            Stalla. However, it was still too frustrating to admit defeat just
            like that.
          </p>
          <p>He hadn’t shown everything yet!</p>
          <p>Suddenly, Russ’s eyes widened as he shouted.</p>
          <p>“Not yet!”</p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The ground beneath Russ exploded. The force of his leap created a
            deep indentation in the earth. He charged forward, raising his
            longsword with his left hand above his head. He quickly closed the
            distance and jumped over Stalla, gritting his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>‘I haven’t mastered it for actual combat yet…’</p>

          <p>
            The sudden enlightenment at the Grand Forge, and the week spent in
            isolation to consolidate that realization, had given him a small yet
            significant breakthrough.
          </p>
          <p>
            The fact that his opponent was an orc no longer mattered. Stalla was
            undoubtedly a great swordsman worthy of his respect. He wanted to
            show something to such a warrior.
          </p>
          <p>As he swung his sword down, Russ inwardly screamed.</p>
          <p>‘Please succeed!’</p>
          <p>A thunderous cry erupted from him.</p>
          <p>“Phantom Divide!”</p>
          <p>
            A magnificent bloom of sword strikes filled Stalla’s vision, dozens
            of slashes flying towards her with terrifying force.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            A storm of blades swept across her field of vision. Dozens of
            slashes imbued with a vibrant blue aura rained down from all
            directions.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, Stalla found herself perplexed.</p>
          <p>‘What is this?’</p>
          <p>
            To the casual observer, it would appear as an immensely impressive
            technique, but in the end, it was just a barrage of sword swings.
            Such chaotic phantom swords might work against ordinary warriors,
            but she was an aura user. She could clearly discern which of those
            numerous slashes were real.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘I can sense only three real strikes. The rest are mere feints.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Against an aura user, an attack like this would only result in lost
            limbs and writhing on the ground. Her opponent, also an aura user,
            must have known this.
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed like he was making a desperate final attack, disregarding
            life and death. If a human warrior saw this, they would scoff at it
            as a foolish act of s*****e…
          </p>
          <p>“A young lad with some promise!”</p>
          <p>But Stalla, being an orc, actually welcomed it.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Indeed, a swordsman shouldn’t be concerned about losing a limb or
            two.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Pleased, Stalla charged into the storm of blades. Ignoring most of
            the deceptive slashes, she used her aura-imbued hand to parry the
            real attacks. Her daggers intercepted the remaining two sword
            strikes in mid-air.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The clash of auras echoed with a thunderous roar. After blocking all
            of Russ’s attacks, Stalla extended her aura blade with one remaining
            hand, aiming for his thigh—a spot that would not kill but would
            certainly wound enough to end the fight.
          </p>
          <p>She was just about to swing her aura strike when…</p>
          <p>Flash!</p>
          <p>
            A blinding light flickered, and a sudden, intense pain erupted from
            her side. The longsword that should have been blocked by her strike
            had somehow moved to her left side and slashed through her.
          </p>
          <p>“Gah?”</p>
          <p>
            Groaning, Stalla quickly retreated. She looked up in shock. There
            had been no sense of presence in that direction.
          </p>
          <p>“What on earth is this?”</p>

            “Wow, you can do things like that with aura,” Repenhardt muttered,
            watching with a slightly surprised expression. As an aura user
            himself, he quickly understood what Russ had done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla was no different. She nodded, applying aura to her side to
            stop the bleeding.
          </p>
          <p>“Is it a technique that separates presence from substance?”</p>
          <p>
            Russ had mixed his aura with a real sword, masking his presence with
            aura while hiding his actual body, then delivered a slash.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla was genuinely impressed by his skillful use of aura. Such a
            technique wasn’t something that could be achieved through mere
            effort. It required innate talent. Repenhardt and Stalla could
            understand what he did, but they couldn’t replicate it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Russ didn’t seem pleased. Holding his sword, he wore a
            dissatisfied expression.
          </p>
          <p>“Tch, it failed…”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs watching were puzzled. They couldn’t understand why he
            called it a failure after landing a solid blow. But Stalla seemed to
            understand.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was quite a decent attack, but it won’t work a second time.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With just one observation, Stalla had figured out the weakness of
            Russ’s technique. She couldn’t replicate the technique, but
            countering it wasn’t difficult. One only needed to ignore the aura
            and focus on the physical vibrations of the air being cut.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, since Russ’s attack hadn’t inflicted a fatal wound
            on Stalla, the technique was now useless. Stalla understood why Russ
            considered it a failure.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright then, let me teach the young one a lesson!”</p>
          <p>
            Taking her stance, Stalla leaped forward, exuding confidence. She
            unleashed her blade aura in conjunction with her daggers. Russ also
            raised his sword to counter.
          </p>
          <p>“Phantom Divide!”</p>
          <p>
            Countless slashes rained down like a storm. However, this time,
            Stalla and her two daggers, imbued with her spirit, ignored the
            presence and detected the vibrations in the air to counterattack.
            Her dazzling blade aura repeatedly slashed through the illusions,
            aiming fiercely at Russ’s real body.
          </p>
          <p>“Hah!”</p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Russ let out a shout and swung his sword diagonally.
            The illusion aimed at her thigh, but she ignored it. It was just an
            aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Recognizing the true slash aiming for her neck, Stalla smiled
            confidently. This one was real! The flow of the air confirmed it!
          </p>
          <p>“Hup!”</p>
          <p>
            With a yell, she confidently moved to block the sword with her palm.
            Suddenly, Russ’s longsword shifted one meter lower, slashing her
            thigh!
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla grimaced, stepping back. Russ clicked his tongue. It was too
            shallow. He had only grazed her skin, barely affecting her combat
            ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Stalla wore a shocked expression that went beyond the pain
            of her wound.
          </p>
          <p>She had been struck again.</p>
          <p>And this time, it was by the aura.</p>

          <p>
            No, to be precise, it was as if the positions of the physical and
            aura attacks had switched places, as if space had shifted. Russ,
            even while gasping for breath as if he might collapse any moment,
            murmured in exhilaration.
          </p>
          <p>“S-success!”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs’ expressions grew even more bewildered. Earlier, Russ had
            landed a solid hit and called it a failure, but now he was
            celebrating after a mere graze.
          </p>
          <p>‘What’s with him?’</p>
          <p>
            In contrast, Stalla, who had the insight to understand Russ’s
            technique, stammered in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“A-amazing… What is this…?”</p>
          <p>“Wow…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, glancing between Russ and Stalla, expressed his
            admiration.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even he couldn’t comprehend what Russ had done. This technique was
            entirely different from the martial arts Repenhardt had learned and
            practiced. Although he was a more powerful aura user than Russ, this
            technique was beyond his understanding.
          </p>
          <p>However, he could make a guess.</p>
          <p>
            Contrary to Stalla’s misconception, Russ hadn’t called the first
            Phantom Divide a failure because it failed to deal a fatal blow. The
            initial Phantom Divide had genuinely been a ‘failed’ execution. The
            separation of presence and substance was merely a byproduct of the
            failed technique.
          </p>
          <p>A successful Phantom Divide was far more than just that.</p>
          <p>
            ‘Has he already grasped the essence of the Void Sword? He truly is a
            genius.’
          </p>
          <p>
            What Russ had just performed was the initial stage of the Void
            Sword, the ultimate technique that had tormented Tassid so much in
            his previous life, wielded by the Sword Saint Cyrus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cyrus was the greatest swordsman who had created his own unique
            swordsmanship, transcending all martial arts on the continent.
          </p>
          <p>
            His sword could traverse space. Although this ability was limited to
            a few meters around him, it was still enough to astonish all
            warriors and mages.
          </p>
          <p>
            The three fundamental elements that no magic of the current era
            could manipulate: time, matter, and space.
          </p>
          <p>
            By honing his aura to the extreme, Cyrus had succeeded in breaking
            the laws of the world with just his sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            How he achieved this was a mystery even to the Archmage Repenhardt,
            and Cyrus himself. It was an intuitive technique, impossible to
            explain theoretically. Consequently, none of Cyrus’s numerous
            disciples had ever managed to grasp the Void Sword, let alone train
            in it.
          </p>
          <p>‘Seeing that again feels so strange.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his cheek bitterly. He vividly remembered how
            much trouble the Void Sword had caused Tassid in his previous life.
            The blade could slice through space itself, making it impossible to
            dodge or block. If it weren’t for his robust orc body, he would have
            died multiple times.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Nevertheless, that rascal Tassid eventually managed to block it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Tassid’s method of dealing with the technique was truly
            characteristic of an orc.
          </p>
          <p>‘He probably just relied on his instincts, didn’t he?’</p>
          <p>
            The Void Sword appeared suddenly, making it utterly unpredictable.
            However, the one wielding the sword, Cyrus, was unmistakably human.
          </p>
          <p>
            What Tassid did was not to anticipate the sword, but to predict
            Cyrus’s thoughts and movements. To put it nicely, it was foresight;
            but in truth, it was more accurate to say, ‘He had fought him so
            often that he instinctively knew what his opponent would do next.’
          </p>
          <p>
            At any rate, seeing what Russ was doing now, it seemed he had
            already found the beginnings of his path at such a young age.
          </p>

          <p>
            ‘He must have picked that up after spending a few days holed up in
            the Grand Forge.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt stroked his chin, clearing his thoughts. Now that Russ
            had shown such potential, Stalla would also give her all. Repenhardt
            watched the two in the clearing. The tense atmosphere was slowly
            rising into the sky over the wilderness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla was frowning as she looked at Russ. She could clearly sense
            that his stamina and aura had significantly dropped. It seemed he
            had exhausted a considerable amount of energy with that technique.
            He looked even more tired than when his right arm had been injured.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s time to wrap this up.’</p>
          <p>
            Though reluctant, Stalla decided that she couldn’t drag this out any
            longer. Russ had already proven his worth more than enough. Besides,
            Stalla had another opponent to face after Russ.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘That big human over there also received the blessing of Debata…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing Repenhardt’s sparkling eyes focused on her, Stalla bit her
            lip.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only an aura user could face another aura user. Among the orc
            warriors present, Stalla was the only one who was an aura user. If
            she were to fight Russ and then immediately face Repenhardt, she
            needed to conserve her strength.
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla extended her hand. Two daggers in the air flew into her
            grasp. Russ looked puzzled. Why was she retrieving her Spirits
            Weapon now?
          </p>
          <p>Stalla grinned, revealing her teeth.</p>
          <p>“It was fun! Now, let’s finish this!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ also raised his usable left hand, assuming his stance once
            more. In his current condition, taking the initiative was
            impossible. The only thing he could do with his remaining strength
            was to counter the opponent’s attacks.
          </p>
          <p>‘Can I activate Phantom Divide one more time?’</p>
          <p>
            His stamina was at its limit, and Phantom Divide wasn’t a technique
            with a high success rate. Despite all his practice, he could barely
            succeed once in ten tries. The fact that he succeeded once out of
            two attempts earlier was nothing short of a blessing from the
            goddess of luck.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, if I lose, I lose.’</p>
          <p>
            Russ relaxed his mind. He had already shown everything he had. And
            in return, he had earned the admiration of the orc warrior, Stalla.
            He had done enough and had no reason to be greedy.
          </p>
          <p>
            With his sword aimed, Russ gathered his remaining energy. Even if he
            was prepared for defeat, he had no intention of losing on purpose.
            He would simply swing his sword with all his might!
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla also gathered her energy. The aura around her was so intense
            that the air shimmered like a mirage above her shoulders. The two
            aura users stared at each other, waiting for the right moment to
            strike the final blow.
          </p>
          <p>“Haaap!”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla moved first. She lunged forward like a bird, her arms holding
            the daggers extended behind her. Russ raised his sword above his
            head, ready to counter.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Stalla thrust her hands forward and shouted.</p>
          <p>“My twelve sisters!”</p>
          <p>
            Ten more daggers shot out from Stalla’s chest! Combined with the two
            daggers she already held, there were now twelve, all of them
            shooting forward like arrows.
          </p>
          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            Amid the deafening roar of the twelve daggers slicing through the
            air, Russ was stunned.
          </p>
          <p>“What, what is this?”</p>

          <p>
            His mouth hung open. Russ, who rarely showed surprise, couldn’t
            control his expression this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The twelve daggers flying towards him were imbued with a chilling
            energy, each blade shimmering with a purple aura. They moved so fast
            and precisely that he couldn’t even track their trajectories.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the twelve destructive lights filling his vision, Russ
            abandoned the idea of a counterattack. His exceptional instincts
            showed him a clear future.
          </p>
          <p>No countermeasure.</p>
          <p>There was absolutely no countermeasure for this.</p>
          <p>Russ quickly dropped his sword and raised his hands high.</p>
          <p>“I concede defeat!”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The sky over the wilderness was turning red. The relentless battle
            had brought the day to its end, with the sun setting on the horizon.
            Stalla, standing proudly against the backdrop of the sunset,
            declared her victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The third duel of the Ritual of Hotu, victory goes to the Blue Bear
            Tribe!”
          </p>
          <p>Then, immediately turning to Russ, she shouted.</p>
          <p>
            “Human warrior! Though I have won, your defeat does not diminish
            your strength. You are a true warrior, and I acknowledge you as a
            fighter!”
          </p>
          <p>“Oooooooh!”</p>
          <p>“Waaaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            The orc warriors erupted in excited cheers. Amidst the jubilation,
            there were cheers not only for Stalla but also for Russ. This
            outsider had stood his ground against a warrior of the Blue Bear
            Tribe and proven himself. If someone like him couldn’t be called a
            warrior, then who could claim the title?
          </p>
          <p>“Cyrus Karuga!”</p>
          <p>“Karuga Cyrus!”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs chanted Russ’s name, waving their fists in the air. Though
            he had lost, Russ returned to his companions with a relieved
            expression, free from any regrets. Silan quickly began healing his
            shoulder with divine power.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Russ caught his breath, Repenhardt approached him with a
            question.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well done, Russ. But when did you learn that? Was it in the Grand
            Forge?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah, pretty much.”</p>
          <p>
            “That technique, Phantom Divide, was it? Show it to me later when we
            spar. I’d like to experience it firsthand.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Against you, big brother, it’s not that useful. After all, someone
            like you doesn’t really dodge anything….”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ shook his head with a wry smile. While the Phantom Divide was a
            fearsome technique that transcended space, it wasn’t very effective
            against Repenhardt. His Spiral Guard could easily deflect any
            attack, making it irrelevant where it came from.
          </p>
          <p>
            Phantom Divide, with its miraculous effect, also required an
            enormous amount of aura to perform. Using up all his strength to
            transcend space, Russ would have no energy left to penetrate
            Repenhardt’s Spiral Guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In that sense, it wouldn’t pose much of a problem for you either,
            big brother.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ chuckled as he glanced back at Stalla. Her technique of
            controlling twelve daggers was indeed terrifying to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            But for Repenhardt? He could just withstand it with his body. No
            matter how many self-moving weapons there were, the aura within them
            was still Stalla’s. Split among twelve daggers, it wouldn’t be
            enough to breach his Spiral Guard.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt shrugged his shoulders.</p>
          <p>“Well, it’s something we’d only know by trying….”</p>
          <p>He cracked his neck from side to side, loosening up.</p>
          <p>“Alright, it’s my turn now.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 114 ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt took off his outer garment and walked to the clearing. He
            removed his clothes in advance, anticipating that they might get
            damaged during the battle. For someone who once ruled as an emperor
            of a nation, this behavior could be seen as rather petty. However,
            having lived through poverty during his time as Gym Unbreakable, the
            current Repenhardt did not realize this perception.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he stripped off his shirt, his steel-like physique was revealed.
            The expressions of the orcs, who were about to cheer for Repenhardt,
            suddenly stiffened.
          </p>
          <p>“What the…”</p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>Orcs revered warriors.</p>
          <p>Orcs praised strength.</p>
          <p>
            To these orcs, Repenhardt’s physique was not just impressive; it was
            utterly mesmerizing. That incredibly trained body! Even by orc
            standards!
          </p>
          <p>“Wow.”</p>
          <p>
            Even Stalla, who had not expected this, widened her eyes for a
            moment. Then, after a brief pause, she offered genuine praise.
          </p>
          <p>“Your physique is amazing.”</p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt blushed at the truly orc-like compliment. Stalla,
            observing her fellow orcs’ reactions, smirked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You don’t need to worry about the ceremony. Everyone is already in
            awe of you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the orc warriors seemed to consider Repenhardt’s bare torso
            sufficient to acknowledge him as a warrior. With such a physique, he
            could not possibly be anything but a warrior. They truly exemplified
            the expression “simple-minded machos.”
          </p>
          <p>“Well, we can’t skip the formal ceremony, though.”</p>
          <p>
            Muttering, Stalla drew her dagger, while Repenhardt also took a
            fighting stance.
          </p>
          <p>He declared loudly,</p>
          <p>
            “My name is Repenhardt Wald Antares! I am ready for the Ritual of
            Hotu!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla, gripping her dagger firmly, introduced herself according to
            the ritual.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am Stalla, warrior of the Blue Bear Tribe. I will fight you.
            Normally, the Ritual of Hotu involves each side sending one
            representative. However, as the only one who can face a warrior like
            you, I have no choice but to fight myself. Forgive me.”
          </p>
          <p>“No matter.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt waved his hand dismissively and shouted a battle cry.
          </p>
          <p>“Urah!”</p>
          <p>
            Golden aura surged like flames, enveloping his entire body. Stalla
            also let out a roar, summoning a blue-purple aura.
          </p>
          <p>“Krarara!”</p>
          <p>
            Just as the two aura-wielders were about to ignite their fighting
            spirits towards each other, a deep voice suddenly interrupted them.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, wife! Would it be alright if I take on that fellow?”</p>
          <p>Startled, Repenhardt turned his head.</p>
          <p>‘Huh!’</p>
          <p>
            The reason for his surprise was simple. The voice had not come from
            the orc warriors’ side but from behind where his own companions
            stood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris, Tilla, and Russ all turned around in surprise. Standing there
            was an orc with a massive greatsword strapped to his back. Like
            Stalla when she first appeared, he was covered in a cloak, revealing
            only his eyes. Yet, those eyes alone exuded an intimidating
            strength.
          </p>

          <p>“Who, who are you?”</p>
          <p>“When did you get here?”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone was shocked. Even Siris, with her keen elven senses, and
            Russ, an aura user, had not noticed anyone approaching from behind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The cloaked orc brushed past Repenhardt’s group, heading toward the
            clearing. Stalla looked at him, tilting her head in confusion.
          </p>
          <p>“Husband?”</p>
          <p>
            As the orc walked forward, Stalla relaxed her stance and sheathed
            her dagger. She asked,
          </p>
          <p>“When did you arrive, husband?”</p>
          <p>
            “I’ve been here for a while, wife. It looked interesting, so I was
            watching.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s entire group stared tensely at the cloaked orc. They
            had not sensed his presence at all. Where had he been watching from?
          </p>
          <p>
            The orc glanced at Russ and Siris, then waved dismissively. Pointing
            to a spot behind them, he spoke in the common tongue.
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t be alarmed. I was over there by that rock.”</p>
          <p>
            He indicated a large rock in the wilderness about 200 to 300 meters
            away. Repenhardt’s face showed understanding. If he had been hiding
            at that distance, it made sense they hadn’t noticed. With the vision
            of an aura user, 200 to 300 meters wasn’t far, making it easy for
            him to observe.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even so, not noticing someone approaching from behind until they
            were right there was embarrassing for any warrior. If this orc had
            hostile intentions, they could have been struck down without even
            realizing it. Russ and Siris still wore hardened expressions, their
            eyes filled with caution as they watched the orc.
          </p>
          <p>
            The orc moved to stand beside Stalla and pulled back his hood. His
            dark red skin and typical orcish features were revealed. His hair
            was white and his face wrinkled, indicating his advanced age.
          </p>
          <p>Stalla looked at him, puzzled, and asked,</p>
          <p>
            “But why are you back already? What about the King of Serpents?”
          </p>
          <p>The King of Serpents.</p>
          <p>
            Humans called this powerful monster the Elder Drake. For many years,
            it had plagued the Blue Bear Tribe as one of their greatest enemies.
            With a body twice the size of a typical drake and scales that even
            blade aura couldn’t easily cut through, this ferocious beast had led
            Stalla’s husband to leave the tribe alone to hunt it just ten days
            ago. She hadn’t expected him to return so soon.
          </p>
          <p>The orc man shrugged his shoulders and replied triumphantly.</p>
          <p>“I already caught it, chopped it up nicely, and delivered it.”</p>
          <p>
            “Already? As expected of my husband. We’ll be feasting for a while.”
          </p>
          <p>“Did well, didn’t I?”</p>
          <p>“You did well, very well.”</p>
          <p>
            After the couple’s intimate(?) reunion, the orc man looked at
            Repenhardt and cheerfully shouted.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Nice to meet you, stranger warrior. I am Kalken, the chieftain and
            warrior of the Blue Bear Tribe.”
          </p>
          <p>☆ ☆ ☆</p>
          <p>
            Standing before Repenhardt, Kalken threw off his cloak. Despite his
            slightly aged face, his body was brimming with youthful, bulging
            muscles.
          </p>
          <p>And…</p>
          <p>‘Ha ha, it’s the first time since my master?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt found it awkward to be looking up at someone for the
            first time in a long while.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken’s height was well over two meters. He seemed to be almost on
            par with the former Fist King Teslon. Although he appeared slightly
            shorter than his master Gerard, orcs typically were slightly shorter
            than humans but had broader physiques. Judging by his broad
            shoulders and thick limbs, his build seemed even more imposing than
            his master’s.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt and Kalken stood facing each other. A few spectators
            rubbed their eyes absentmindedly. The sight of the two massive
            figures standing side by side was confusing their sense of
            perspective.
          </p>

          <p>Kalken asked Repenhardt a question.</p>
          <p>“Human warrior, may I face you on behalf of my wife?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt responded boldly.</p>
          <p>“Fine by me!”</p>
          <p>
            If this were a duel where victory mattered, there would have been no
            reason to face the formidable Kalken instead of the exhausted
            Stalla. However, the Ritual of Hotu wasn’t about winning. Refusing
            the challenge here would have made him appear dishonorable, unworthy
            of a warrior. It was better to show a bold front and gain more
            respect.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s what I wanted!”</p>
          <p>Kalken burst into hearty laughter.</p>
          <p>“Ha ha ha! Good! You’re a real man!”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken drew a greatsword from his back. The sword was even longer
            than Kalken, who stood over two meters tall. The blade was so
            massive that if laid sideways, it could easily provide shelter for
            several people.
          </p>
          <p>Wooong!</p>
          <p>
            A gigantic green blade aura enveloped the enormous sword. Raising
            the aura-infused sword, Kalken shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Draw your weapon!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt took his stance, his fists glowing with a golden aura.
          </p>
          <p>“I am my own weapon!”</p>
          <p>“Oh?”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken looked intrigued. While the orcs had their traditional
            hand-to-hand combat techniques, no one seriously fought barehanded
            against armed opponents. With the secret technique known as Spirits
            Weapon, an armed orc was incomparably stronger.
          </p>
          <p>“흥미롭군!”</p>
          <p>Kalken roared, his eyes gleaming.</p>
          <p>“Let’s fight!”</p>
          <p>In that moment, Repenhardt chuckled and extended his hand.</p>
          <p>“Dream, descend upon me. Improved Sleep!”</p>
          <p>Just as Kalken was about to charge, he collapsed with a thud.</p>
          <p>“Snore~!”</p>
          <p>“……”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone watching fell silent. They were all agape, utterly
            dumbfounded. They had been eagerly anticipating a fierce clash
            between powerful aura users, but now this?
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how much an orc tried, an orc was still an orc. Just
            because one was an aura user didn’t mean they suddenly gained magic
            resistance.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan mumbled, his face blank with disbelief.</p>
          <p>“Well, this is anticlimactic…”</p>
          <p>Russ wore a similar expression.</p>
          <p>“You can’t possibly count this as a victory, right?”</p>
          <p>“…Surely not?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris clicked her tongue. The Ritual of Hotu was meant to measure a
            warrior’s prowess. No orc would accept magic as proof of a warrior’s
            worth. She couldn’t understand why Repenhardt had done such a thing.
          </p>

          <p>‘This will only breed resentment, won’t it?’</p>
          <p>
            Sure enough, Stalla was looking back and forth between her husband,
            who was now snoring on the ground, and Repenhardt, who had his hands
            raised in the air in a spellcasting gesture.
          </p>
          <p>“This, this is not the warrior’s way!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt gestured towards Stalla, who was protesting indignantly.
          </p>
          <p>“Wake him up.”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla clicked her tongue and approached her husband, nudging him
            with her foot. Kalken yawned, opened his eyes, and looked around
            dazedly.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? Didn’t I get a good rest?”</p>
          <p>“You were hit by a spell, husband.”</p>
          <p>“Huh? That fellow’s a mage too?”</p>
          <p>Kalken looked at Repenhardt with astonished eyes.</p>
          <p>
            He wouldn’t have been this surprised if his opponent had been a
            regular human. But Kalken had already realized that Repenhardt was a
            powerful aura user. For someone with the strength of a mighty
            warrior to also wield magic?
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt shrugged and responded.</p>
          <p>“I am both a warrior and a mage. I informed you to be fair.”</p>
          <p>The orcs’ expressions turned peculiar.</p>
          <p>
            As much as they revered warriors, orcs despised the existence of
            mages. Magic, which could not be blocked no matter how much one
            trained, was akin to the devil’s work to the orcs.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, openly despising him was not an option, as Repenhardt was
            undeniably a formidable warrior. It was difficult to determine
            whether he should be acknowledged or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, speaking in a calm voice, addressed the bewildered
            Kalken and the other orcs.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My magic, like my body, is also my weapon. Would it not be
            disrespectful if I did not use everything I possess against you?”
          </p>
          <p>On reflection, this made sense. Kalken mumbled uncertainly.</p>
          <p>“I-Is that so?”</p>
          <p>
            Pretending to be unruffled on the outside, Repenhardt anxiously
            observed the reactions of the orcs.
          </p>
          <p>‘Hmm, how will they respond?’</p>
          <p>
            In truth, Repenhardt had not employed the sleep spell out of
            ignorance of the orcs’ aversion to magic. However, he needed to gain
            the orcs’ trust. Since it was not as if he would never use magic in
            front of them for the rest of his life, hiding his identity as a
            mage only to be discovered later would result in an even greater
            loss of trust.
          </p>
          <p>Trust was hard to gain but easy to lose in an instant.</p>
          <p>
            Despite the possibility of being met with suspicion, being honest
            about everything now was a better choice for the future.
          </p>
          <p>And, in fact, he had something to rely on.</p>
          <p>‘Kalken’s perception of magic wasn’t that bad.’</p>
          <p>Sure enough, Kalken’s expression softened, and he nodded.</p>
          <p>
            “Indeed. If magic is also your weapon, not using it would be rather
            dishonorable.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The orcs murmured and exchanged puzzled glances at Kalken’s
            acceptance of magic.
          </p>
          <p>“Isn’t magic bad?”</p>
          <p>“But isn’t not using a weapon when you have one also bad?”</p>
          <p>“But is magic a weapon? Isn’t that cheating?”</p>
          <p>
            “Isn’t it more dishonorable not to give your all in the Ritual of
            Hotu? I appreciate the honesty.”
          </p>
          <p>“This is hard…”</p>
          <p>
            In the end, the murmuring orcs reached a conclusion typical of their
            kind.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, if the chieftain says so, then it must be.”</p>
          <p>
            True to their simple nature, they gave up on thinking deeply and
            just accepted it because Kalken had said so. Kalken stood up,
            holding his greatsword, and looked at Repenhardt.

          <p>[ Chapter 115 ]</p>
          <p>“Human warrior, I thank you for your consideration.”</p>
          <p>
            It was a voice that clearly acknowledged magic. As Kalken continued
            speaking to the inwardly relieved Repenhardt, he said,
          </p>
          <p>“But that alone will not earn our trust.”</p>
          <p>“I am aware.”</p>
          <p>
            Acknowledging magic did not mean Kalken recognized the magician as
            well. He merely saw it as one of Repenhardt’s weapons. If Repenhardt
            confronted Kalken with methods that were uncharacteristic of a
            warrior and more like those of a magician, even if he won, he would
            only be perceived as a powerful magician, not gain their trust.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Repenhardt of the past life had earned the trust of the orcs
            because of his actions and attitude towards them. It was never due
            to the power of strong magic. In fact, despite his earnest efforts
            towards the orcs, he had struggled immensely to win them over
            because he was a magician.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Thanks to this body, the process will be faster now. This is good.’
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt chuckled inwardly.</p>
          <p>Kalken raised his greatsword and shouted like a declaration.</p>
          <p>“Then, let us begin the Ritual of Hotu again!”</p>
          <p>“Very well!”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt aimed his two fists at Kalken.</p>
          <p>Kalken also emitted a green aura, getting into a battle stance.</p>
          <p>
            The atmosphere became tense again. With eyes full of determination,
            Kalken and Repenhardt glared at each other. A fierce fighting spirit
            rose between them, blending like a mirage.
          </p>
          <p>At a certain moment.</p>
          <p>“Taaat!”</p>
          <p>“Kaaaat!”</p>
          <p>The two aura users lunged at each other.</p>
          <p>
            Kalken’s greatsword swung long towards Repenhardt. The green aura on
            the over two-meter-long blade shimmered, scattering the light of
            destruction.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Wherever the aura grazed, explosions erupted, kicking up clouds of
            dust. Repenhardt blocked the blade with spiral guards on his
            forearms and extended his left fist.
          </p>
          <p>“Energy Blast!”</p>
          <p>
            A golden projectile flew straight at Kalken. Kalken dodged by
            leaping to the side and brought down his sword again. Focusing the
            aura of his entire body into a single strike, the intensity of it
            sent shivers through Repenhardt, who stepped aside to avoid the
            onslaught. The philosophy of Gym Unbreakable was to endure most
            attacks with the body, but the force imbued in Kalken’s sword was
            extraordinary. It had enough power to pierce through Repenhardt’s
            spiral guard.
          </p>
          <p>
            Narrowly dodging the blade and closing the distance, Repenhardt
            repeatedly thrust his fists while shouting.
          </p>
          <p>“Chain Energy Blast!”</p>

          <p>
            Dozens of aura projectiles poured down, occupying all directions
            around Kalken. The trajectories were too many to deflect
            individually, but Kalken easily blocked all attacks using the flat
            of his sword as a shield.
          </p>
          <p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The clash of auras echoed loudly. Clicking his tongue, Repenhardt
            widened the distance.
          </p>
          <p>‘As expected, orcs handle such massive weapons so well.’</p>
          <p>
            The martial arts of the orcs, developed over long years, had
            intricate aspects. Despite the large size of their weapons, their
            movements were never sluggish. Using the sword’s center of gravity
            to deliver powerful strikes and then changing the trajectory with
            centrifugal force, Kalken’s technique left Repenhardt constantly
            retreating, unable to find a way to counter it immediately.
          </p>
          <p>
            Continuously throwing punches and swinging his legs, Repenhardt
            fervently blocked Kalken’s attacks.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Dozens of exchanges took place, and the sound of thunder echoed in
            all directions. After fighting for a while, Repenhardt decided to
            attempt magic discreetly.
          </p>
          <p>“Dream, take hold. Improved Sleep!”</p>
          <p>
            It was an improved sleep spell he had used before. Thanks to his
            hard work, he had reached a level where he could cast lower circle
            magic even during combat. In truth, this single spell would put
            Kalken to sleep again, making it quite a sneaky tactic.
          </p>
          <p>‘But by now, I’ve proven my worth as a warrior sufficiently.’</p>
          <p>
            Honestly, if the fight continued, someone might get hurt, so he
            planned to conclude the duel here. As expected…
          </p>
          <p>“Zzz!”</p>
          <p>
            Sadly, it worked immediately. Mental spells couldn’t be seen like
            fire or lightning, making them impossible to dodge. Thinking he had
            won, Repenhardt was about to deliver a final blow.
          </p>
          <p>“Zzz!”</p>
          <p>
            Snoring loudly like a battle cry, the sleeping Kalken dodged his
            attack and counterattacked!
          </p>
          <p>“What the…?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, utterly shocked, took a hit to his side. Grimacing, he
            stepped back. Fortunately, his instincts kicked in, activating his
            spiral guard, allowing him to fend off the slash. However, he was
            still bewildered.
          </p>
          <p>“Did the spell not work?”</p>
          <p>
            That wasn’t the case. He could still hear Kalken snoring. Yet, his
            body remained in a proper combat stance, moving automatically like a
            sleepwalker.
          </p>
          <p>After a moment, Kalken yawned and woke up from his sleep.</p>
          <p>“Yawn! Did it happen again?”</p>
          <p>
            Then, as if nothing had happened, he resumed the duel. Repenhardt,
            bewildered, muttered to himself.
          </p>
          <p>“Did Kalken have such a skill?”</p>
          <p>☆ ☆ ☆</p>
          <p>
            Sillan, who had been watching the duel, asked Russ in a puzzled
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow, he can fight while sleeping? Can aura users do that?”</p>

          <p>
            But Russ did not answer Sillan’s question. He simply muttered to
            himself in admiration.
          </p>
          <p>“This is truly educational…”</p>
          <p>
            Russ had the keen insight of an industrial spy when it came to
            absorbing others’ secret techniques. The moment he saw it, he
            understood exactly what Kalken had done.
          </p>
          <p>
            Right now, Kalken had set it up so that after leaving a portion of
            his aura in his nervous system, his body would automatically
            counterattack as soon as the command from his brain was cut off.
            Sometimes, when an aura user loses consciousness due to severe
            injury, the aura rises on its own and heals the body. The aura,
            which manifests from the body’s vitality, possesses this
            self-protective nature, and Kalken had skillfully extracted and
            isolated only that trait through delicate aura manipulation.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If you handle aura like that, you can artificially impart a
            reflexive nature. I should practice that later.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ, who had gained yet another new technique, wore a delighted
            expression. He was increasingly glad that he had decided to follow
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            In truth, even aura users rarely fought against other aura users.
            Aura users were practically strategic weapons themselves. Unless
            there was a war between nations, it was rare for them to personally
            engage in combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, information about a warrior’s techniques was akin to their
            lifeline, so unless it was an extremely urgent situation, sparring
            between aura users was also avoided. If they were at Russ’s level or
            higher, they could roughly grasp their opponent’s techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Russ had already met five aura users in the few months he
            had followed Repenhardt. Not only during his duel with the Dwarf
            aura user but also with Kalken and Stalla, he had already acquired
            several techniques. Unlike humans, other races had unique ways of
            handling aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            With an excited face, Russ continued to focus on the clearing. To
            Russ, who had always hungered for martial arts, their duels were
            like a grand feast laid out before him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Repenhardt continued to exchange attacks with Kalken,
            observing his opponent. His mind was in turmoil. In his memory,
            Kalken had never used such techniques.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No, maybe he never needed to. Back then, I had distributed mental
            defense charms to all my orcs.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Thinking back, since there was no chance of losing consciousness due
            to magic at that time, there would have been no reason to use that
            technique. To confirm, Repenhardt attempted magic once again.
          </p>
          <p>“Be petrified, like stone! Paralyze!”</p>
          <p>
            It was certain that Kalken had no resistance to magic. The spell
            worked properly again this time, but it still had no effect. Once
            again, Kalken’s ‘automatic combat mode’ simply counterattacked.
          </p>
          <p>“Magic will no longer work!”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken shouted, counterattacking as if nothing had happened.
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue as he scrutinized him. It took him a
            bit longer than Russ, but he had finally figured out Kalken’s
            technique.
          </p>
          <p>‘So that’s how it is? Then mental magic won’t work.’</p>
          <p>
            Mental magic essentially involved interfering with the opponent’s
            brain. As soon as the interference occurred, everything below the
            neck disconnected from the brain and moved autonomously, rendering
            it useless.
          </p>
          <p>‘Should I try another spell?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt contemplated for a moment. There were many spells that
            could be effective against an orc with weak magic resistance, even
            if they weren’t mental spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he soon dismissed the thought. He was undergoing the Ritual of
            Hotu. Although he was a mage, and his mind had briefly shifted in
            that direction, now was the time to showcase his skills as a
            warrior.
          </p>
          <p>Taking a stance, Repenhardt spoke.</p>
          <p>“Then let’s get serious!”</p>
          <p>With a grin, Kalken responded.</p>
          <p>“I’ve been waiting for this!”</p>
          <p>☆ ☆ ☆</p>

          <p>
            An aura-infused greatsword tore through the air, producing a
            deafening roar.
          </p>
          <p>
            A golden iron fist sliced through the empty space, creating a
            magnificent shockwave.
          </p>
          <p>
            The iron fist and greatsword clashed, shaking the sky and tearing up
            the ground.
          </p>
          <p>Clang! Clang!</p>
          <p>
            The terrifying sound of thunder continuously echoed, as if to split
            eardrums. Brilliant auras intertwined, swirling like a storm.
            Dodging, blocking, and counterattacking in quick succession, Kalken
            and Repenhardt displayed a closely matched contest, showcasing all
            the techniques they had mastered.
          </p>
          <p>“Hahaha! This is delightful!”</p>
          <p>
            Swinging his greatsword, Kalken shouted in excitement. Repenhardt,
            equally exhilarated, shouted back.
          </p>
          <p>“Impressive technique!”</p>
          <p>
            Not long ago, Repenhardt had insisted he was a mage, but now he was
            caught up in the atmosphere and was getting excited. No matter how
            much his soul belonged to a mage, his body was that of a warrior,
            and he couldn’t help but be influenced. Besides, it had already been
            nearly six or seven years since Repenhardt, resurrected in this era,
            had been training as a warrior. Even without considering his
            physical state, he had already been reborn as an excellent warrior.
          </p>
          <p>
            How long had they been fighting so intensely? Swinging his
            greatsword, Kalken shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s bring this to an end, human warrior!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt responded, thrusting a front kick toward the greatsword.
          </p>
          <p>“So will I!”</p>
          <p>
            The exploration of each other’s capabilities had long since ended.
            Both knew it was time to attempt a decisive strike. They exchanged
            blows continuously, seeking an opening in each other’s defenses.
          </p>
          <p>
            At some point, Repenhardt launched a series of aerial kicks at
            Kalken. His aura-infused legs whirled like windmills, rushing
            straight at Kalken. Although Kalken twisted his greatsword to
            defend, the heavy kicks landed in succession, pushing him far back.
            His legs dug into the ground, leaving long furrows like plow marks.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Despite blocking with the flat of his sword, his arms went numb. As
            Kalken groaned, Repenhardt suddenly bent his knees and pulled his
            right fist back.
          </p>
          <p>Whoom! Whoom! Whoom!</p>
          <p>
            Golden aura gradually gathered around his fist. It was his most
            powerful strike, the Calamity Horn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken instinctively recognized the technique and heightened his
            vigilance. In a simple warrior’s duel, one could just stab the
            opponent while they were preparing an attack, but among aura users,
            their auras protected their bodies even in such moments. Attempting
            to exploit a gap with a weaker technique would only invite a deadly
            counterattack.
          </p>
          <p>There was only one course of action for Kalken to take.</p>
          <p>He would also use his strongest technique!</p>
          <p>Kalken extended his greatsword behind him. He let out a roar.</p>
          <p>“Raaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            The green aura on the greatsword exploded into a dazzling light.
            They both concentrated their full power on a single point, eyeing
            each other intensely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without needing a signal, the two warriors launched themselves
            simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt thrust his fist forward. The golden aura converged into a
            formidable horn of destruction, shooting toward Kalken.
          </p>
          <p>“Calamity Horn!”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken swung his sword downward. The aura on the greatsword emitted
            an irregular trajectory and a thunderous roar. The greatsword became
            a bolt of lightning aimed at Repenhardt’s head.
          </p>
          <p>“Thunder Drop!”</p>
          <p>
            Their ultimate techniques clashed, shaking the sky over the
            wilderness.
          </p>
          <p>KABOOM!</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 116 ]</p>
          <p>“Ouch, take it easy, Sillan!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt screamed, glaring at Sillan. Sillan frowned back and
            shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Just bear with it, you old man! It’s going to hurt like hell!”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan had his hand on Repenhardt’s utterly battered chest, casting
            a healing spell. As the pink holy light permeated his entire body,
            the torn skin and ruptured muscles healed at an astonishing speed.
            And in proportion to that speed, Repenhardt’s screams grew even
            louder.
          </p>
          <p>“Ouch! Ow! Hey, when will this end?”</p>
          <p>“It’ll be over soon. Geez.”</p>
          <p>Calamity Horn and Thunder Drop.</p>
          <p>
            The clash of their most powerful techniques ended in a draw. The
            concentrated destructive force from both sides repelled each other,
            resulting in a merciless explosion, and Repenhardt and Kalken were
            both flung to opposite sides by the vortex of aura.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such was the strength of their techniques that even the residual
            destructive power, after most of it canceled out, left both of them
            in a tattered state. Stalla, who presided over the Ritual of Hotu,
            declared a draw in the traditional orcish expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The skills of these two warriors are like twins born on the same
            day!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Immediately after, Repenhardt and Kalken, who were lying around like
            rags, were hurriedly supported and taken away from both sides.
            Sillan was now healing Repenhardt…
          </p>
          <p>“Ouch! Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Watching Repenhardt groan continuously, Tilla muttered in disbelief.
          </p>
          <p>“Is the holy healing of Philanence really that painful?”</p>
          <p>
            When Tilla first met Repenhardt, he was in a severely injured state.
            Even then, he didn’t let out a single groan, enduring the pain.
            Honestly, compared to back then, this didn’t seem like such a
            serious injury. Yet, he was screaming like this?
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ah, no? I’ve received healing from Sillan many times and it
            actually felt soothing…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris replied with a puzzled expression. Sillan, still casting the
            healing spell, explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s because there’s still some of the opponent’s residual aura
            in Repen’s body.”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt began to explain despite his pain.</p>
          <p>
            “Ugh, originally, aura, holy power, and magic have different
            properties. Aura doesn’t repel each other like magic and holy power
            do, but still, they don’t fully merge because of their different
            properties. Especially right now, the aura in my body isn’t mine,
            but Kalken’s. The foreign aura is resisting the holy power trying to
            heal my body. Ugh! This pain is killing me!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked at Repenhardt in awe. It wasn’t his knowledge that
            impressed them, but his tenacity to explain despite the pain. It was
            the quintessential trait of a mage who would rather die than miss a
            chance to elucidate.
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s why I suggested we wait a bit before treating you,” Sillan
            frowned as he continued to channel the holy light. As a priest, he
            didn’t enjoy feeling like he was torturing someone while performing
            a good deed like healing.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The residual aura would have dissipated after a few hours anyway…”
          </p>

          <p>Repenhardt gritted his teeth as he watched Sillan grumble.</p>
          <p>
            “No matter what, the orcs aren’t fully on our side yet. We don’t
            know how the situation will unfold, so I couldn’t stay injured… Ugh!
            Maybe I should’ve waited after all?”
          </p>
          <p>
            To be honest, Repenhardt regretted his rash decision. Judging by the
            expressions of the Blue Bear Tribe, it was clear they now recognized
            him and his comrades as trustworthy warriors. His worries about the
            situation worsening seemed unfounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, he had requested the healing out of his cautious mage
            instincts, considering even the slightest possibility…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Having endured all sorts of pain during my time as Gym Unbreakable,
            I thought I could handle this.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Grinding his teeth, Repenhardt endured the pain. Eventually, the
            pain vanished, and a surge of vitality filled his body. The healing
            spell was finally complete.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, I thought I was going to die.”</p>
          <p>
            “Is that something someone who just received a healing spell should
            say?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan quipped as he stood up, throwing a reproachful look at the
            now perfectly healed Repenhardt. Then, he looked over at the orcs
            and asked.
          </p>
          <p>“Shall I treat you as well?”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken was in much worse shape than Repenhardt. While the power of
            their techniques might have been equal, there was a significant
            difference in their physical durability. Kalken’s body was robust,
            but compared to Gym Unbreakable, who had dedicated his life to
            hardening his body, Kalken fell short. Honestly, from Sillan’s
            perspective, Kalken seemed more urgent than Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken’s face turned pale at Sillan’s kind offer. He had already
            witnessed what that ‘healing spell’ had done to Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>‘To think such a fearless warrior would scream like that!’</p>
          <p>
            No matter how he saw it, it looked more like torture than healing.
          </p>
          <p>“No, I’m fine, human. Just leave me be, I’ll heal on my own.”</p>
          <p>
            With Stalla’s help, Kalken set a splint on his broken arm and
            bandaged his wounds. Struggling to his feet, he mustered his
            strength and shouted to Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“Human warrior! I recognize you as a trustworthy warrior!”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs collectively let out a cheer. It was an act of celebrating
            the successful completion of the Ritual of Hotu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Limping, Kalken approached Repenhardt and solemnly declared, “Human
            warriors, we are now brothers.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken spoke in the common language so that everyone in Repenhardt’s
            group could understand. Everyone’s expressions brightened.
            Repenhardt, delighted, began speaking in the orc language.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is joyous, Kalken of the Blue Bear Tribe. Now that we are
            brothers, there is something I wish to say to you…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as Repenhardt was about to broach the subject, Kalken suddenly
            waved his hand, stopping him.
          </p>
          <p>“Later.”</p>
          <p>“Hmm?”</p>

          <p>
            Kalken then grinned widely, baring his teeth, as he looked at the
            bewildered Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“First, let’s drink.”</p>
          <p>“…”</p>
          <p>
            “We’ve communicated with our blades, now we should resolve things
            with drink!”
          </p>
          <p>
            At the mention of drinking, the orcs cheered again. The Ritual of
            Hotu was meant to strengthen ties between orc tribes, so it was only
            natural that a celebration would follow.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken turned his attention to the rest of the group and exuberantly
            shouted in the common language, “Let’s go to my place! There’s
            plenty of drink there!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite Repenhardt’s understanding of orc language, Kalken chose to
            speak in the common language, showing his thoughtful nature beneath
            his rugged exterior. Though it sounded humorous, everyone
            appreciated Kalken’s consideration and began to gather their horses.
            The orcs mounted their direwolves and prepared to leave.
          </p>
          <p>
            As time passed, evening arrived, and the twilight sun cast deep
            shadows over the wasteland. The orcs and Repenhardt’s group set off
            together, side by side.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            A large bonfire lit up the darkened wasteland. The Blue Bear Tribe
            was holding a welcoming festival for Repenhardt’s group.
          </p>
          <p>
            All the orcs sat gathered in the clearing, and Repenhardt’s group
            joined them. As orcs had no concept of chairs, everyone just sat on
            the ground, but Repenhardt’s group was treated as honored guests,
            each given a beast skin to sit on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standing before the bonfire, Kalken raised a horn-made cup and
            shouted, “It is truly joyous to meet new brothers! Let us all raise
            our cups in celebration!”
          </p>
          <p>“Waah!”</p>
          <p>
            The orcs directed their cheers and warm gazes at Repenhardt’s group,
            welcoming them heartily. Of course, from the perspective of the
            group, the orcs’ glistening eyes and loud shouts seemed more like
            they were about to devour them. Sillan and Russ, who did not
            understand orc language, awkwardly raised their cups.
          </p>
          <p>“I know it’s meant to be a good thing, but…”</p>
          <p>“It’s so intense, I can barely drink…”</p>
          <p>
            In any case, it was true that the orcs sincerely welcomed the group.
            Even though their fellow orcs, who had gone out to guard against
            human intruders, unexpectedly brought back humans and called them
            brothers, no one showed any signs of suspicion. Among them were even
            the orc scouts who had been affected by Repenhardt’s magic, and even
            they seemed convinced. It was as if they thought, “If the great
            warriors recognize them, we will too.”
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘They haven’t changed at all. That’s why they used to suffer a lot
            back in the day…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his cheek, recalling old records. The orcs’
            tendency to treat any strong opponent like a brother, regardless of
            their race, had often been exploited by humans. Before humans
            dominated the continent, it wasn’t uncommon for orcs to be deceived
            and betrayed by humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, for a while, there was a prevalent narrow-mindedness
            among the orcs, where they wouldn’t recognize any warrior outside
            their own kin, no matter how strong. However, as time passed and
            most orcs were pushed to the outskirts, and humans no longer needed
            to use schemes to deal with them, the orcs seemed to have returned
            to their former, simpler state.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Should I say it’s good that they’ve regained their original nature…
            or bad that they’ve become naive again…?’
          </p>
          <p>Orcs were strong because they were simple.</p>
          <p>
            When faced with human schemes, they had once become cunning, but it
            had been a detriment to them. As they grew more cunning, the orcs
            became weaker. They began to fear death as their thoughts
            multiplied, and they lost their visions, their Spirits Weapons, and
            their beast taming techniques. Combined with their excessively weak
            resistance to magic, they eventually lost their territory to humans
            and fell into slavery.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, the orcs of the Blue Bear Tribe surely retained the
            primitive strength of their ancestors.
          </p>

          <p>Suddenly, Kalken called out to Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>“Brother! Take my drink!”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken filled his cup to the brim and handed it to Repenhardt. True
            to his large stature, Kalken’s horn cup was big enough for Sillan to
            use as a hat.
          </p>
          <p>Taking the cup, Repenhardt felt a moment of unease.</p>
          <p>‘Ugh, it’s that stuff.’</p>
          <p>
            He remembered. The pungent liquid made from fermented goat or mare’s
            milk that orcs commonly drank. He had tasted it in his previous life
            as the Emperor of the Antares Empire.
          </p>
          <p>‘It was incredibly strong and incredibly awful.’</p>
          <p>
            But he couldn’t frown at the hospitality. Repenhardt forced a smile
            as he accepted the cup. In the past, drinking just one cup had
            knocked him out, earning him the ridicule of the orcs…
          </p>
          <p>“Oh? It’s good!”</p>
          <p>
            Sure enough, it seemed that his taste buds had changed along with
            his body. After all, he had experienced all sorts of terrible food
            under his master Gerard. He had even chewed on basilisk meat at the
            Grand Forge, finding it tasty. His sense of taste was so damaged (?)
            that almost anything in the world seemed delicious to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Does it suit your taste? I was a bit worried it might not be to a
            human’s liking.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken beamed with joy at the praise of their drink. Well, judging
            by Russ and Sillan taking a sip and tearing up, it didn’t seem to
            suit human taste. From the expressions of Siris and Tilla, it
            appeared to be the same for elves and dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>Kalken turned to Stalla and shouted loudly.</p>
          <p>
            “My brother enjoys our drink! Isn’t that wonderful? Wife, bring out
            the barrels! Tonight, we’ll empty them with our brother!”
          </p>
          <p>“You’re always quick to find an excuse to drink.”</p>
          <p>
            Throwing a retort, Stalla entered the tent and soon returned with a
            barrel under each arm. These massive barrels could have fit Sillan
            inside with room to spare. Taking them, Kalken placed one in front
            of each of them and said to Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s drink!”</p>
          <p>
            He then opened the lid and began to gulp down the contents straight
            from the barrel. Finishing it in one go, Kalken patted his bulging
            belly and let out a loud burp.
          </p>
          <p>“Burp! Indeed, drinking from the barrel tastes the best!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, Tilla, Russ, and Sillan all gaped in astonishment. They had
            heard that orcs were reckless, but this was beyond their
            expectations. Who on earth drinks a whole barrel in one go?
          </p>
          <p>Meanwhile, Repenhardt maintained a calm expression.</p>
          <p>‘Brings back memories.’</p>
          <p>
            There was a time under his master when he lived with even larger
            death traps attached to his mouth daily. What was a mere barrel of
            drink compared to that?
          </p>
          <p>
            Remembering his days as Gym Unbreakable, Repenhardt grabbed the
            barrel and began to chug. For a long while, he tipped the barrel
            back, pouring the liquid down his throat. The orcs’ faces showed
            growing amazement.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a moment, Repenhardt set the emptied barrel down heavily. The
            orcs erupted into cheers.
          </p>
          <p>“Oooooooh!”</p>
          <p>“Amazing!”</p>
          <p>“Truly a warrior!”</p>
          <p>
            Orcs believed that those who could hold their liquor were strong and
            virile. Seeing Repenhardt’s impressive feat, they felt an even
            greater sense of camaraderie with him.

          <p>[ Chapter 117 ]</p>
          <p>As the night deepened, the festival grew more vibrant.</p>
          <p>
            Orcs of the Blue Bear Tribe, regardless of age or gender, indulged
            heartily in alcohol and meat. The timing was perfect. They had the
            Turtle Lion caught by Tassid and the Elder Drake meat harvested by
            Kalken, so there was plenty of food. Living in the wilderness, the
            only salt they occasionally found was rock salt, and the orcs’
            preservation method was the primitive technique of smoking. This
            ingrained the habit of consuming everything immediately when food
            was available.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orcs, full and drunk, began singing songs in their native tongue.
            These traditional songs, with their intense rhythms and rough
            melodies, boasted the fervor of military marches or battle hymns. In
            sync with the songs, some orcs started fighting.
          </p>
          <p>“Graah! Come on! Come on!”</p>
          <p>“I’ll lay you out, you bastard!”</p>
          <p>
            Orc festivals inherently lacked the concept of dancing like other
            races. Instead, when a festival began, orcs ate, drank, and fought
            to their heart’s content.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There’s even a custom where, during weddings, the bride and groom
            engage in a brawl, and the victor carries the loser to the bridal
            chamber,” explained Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>Sillan shuddered visibly.</p>
          <p>“Th-that’s a terrifying custom.”</p>
          <p>
            For some reason, Sillan trembled more than usual, as if there was
            another reason behind it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orcs who weren’t fighting showed interest in Repenhardt’s group,
            chattering amongst themselves, mostly the female orcs. The saying
            that ‘when three women gather, dishes get broken’ proved
            surprisingly universal across races.
          </p>
          <p>“Are elves that fat? It’s amazing they’re strong despite that.”</p>
          <p>“That dwarf woman is also fat. How could she become a warrior?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, noticing the orc women whispering about them, quietly asked
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“What are they saying?”</p>
          <p>
            Upon hearing that they were being called fat for the first time in
            their lives, Siris and Tilla’s faces crumpled. They learned from
            Repenhardt that orcs considered anyone without visible muscles as
            fat, no matter how slender they appeared.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, this feels strange.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed.”</p>
          <p>
            Being called fat by women whose arms were thicker than their thighs
            left them at a loss for words. Tilla took a swig of alcohol
            irritably and then coughed harshly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beside them, Sillan looked troubled at the pile of meat in front of
            him. For some reason, the orc women kept bringing food exclusively
            to him.
          </p>

          <p>“Uh, I’m full now…”</p>
          <p>“Ke-chant! Ke-chant!”</p>
          <p>
            Unlike the warriors, these ordinary tribe members did not seem to
            know the common language and continued to address Sillan in Orcish.
            Nevertheless, it was easy to understand from their gestures that
            they were encouraging him to eat. The fact that they kept giving him
            food indicated they were being quite hospitable. Despite his
            awkwardness, Sillan was happy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, he wouldn’t have been happy if he understood what the
            orcs were saying.
          </p>
          <p>“That one, they say he’s a boy.”</p>
          <p>“Goodness! Is that boy so skinny?”</p>
          <p>“He looks like he might die soon.”</p>
          <p>
            “Poor thing. Imagine how much self-loathing he must feel among the
            warriors.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though he was being treated like a frail child about to die,
            Sillan continued to smile blissfully, unaware of their words.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Uh, thank you, but I’ve already eaten plenty. Really. You don’t
            need to give me more… Oh, here comes more.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Russ sat by the campfire, watching the orc festival. He
            could now understand what Repenhardt was saying.
          </p>
          <p>
            Orcs might look crude, but they were emotional and rational beings.
            Their valor and warrior ethos seemed similar to that of knights. In
            fact, knights could be quite crude as well, and when they held
            drinking parties, it wasn’t much different from the current scene.
            From Russ’s perspective, it resonated more emotionally than his time
            with the dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm, is this what hyung meant to convey…?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The night of the festival was in full swing. Suddenly, a small
            commotion arose among the orcs. Curious about the hubbub,
            Repenhardt, who was drinking with Kalken, asked.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm? What’s happening?”</p>
          <p>“Ah, it seems the shepherds have returned.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite their heavy drinking, neither showed signs of inebriation.
            Both were highly trained individuals who could wield aura, and it
            would take a lot to make them feel drunk. Their slightly reddened
            faces indicated that they might be a bit tipsy, though.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Kalken’s words, Repenhardt nodded, thinking it was nothing
            significant and prepared to resume his drinking with Kalken.
            However, among the shepherd orcs who had joined the festival, there
            was one who stood out. Unlike the others with their dark red skin,
            this robust orc had green skin. Seeing him, Repenhardt sprang to his
            feet.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh!”</p>
          <p>
            The orc also widened his eyes in surprise upon seeing Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“Isn’t this my benefactor?”</p>

          <p>
            This orc was none other than Tassid, who had been his loyal
            subordinate in a previous life and whom he had guided to his destiny
            as a future great orc warrior in this life. He had been looking for
            him earlier but hadn’t seen him, and now here he was.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tassid, his face lit with joy, ran towards Repenhardt. Seeing this,
            Repenhardt felt a deep sense of nostalgia. Tassid was no longer the
            weak and small boy he remembered. Now, he stood as a robust figure
            with a fierce expression, resembling the friend in his memories.
          </p>
          <p>“Tassid!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt called out his name warmly. As they met, Tassid grasped
            Repenhardt’s hand. Overjoyed, Tassid spoke.
          </p>
          <p>“You recognize me! Even though I’ve changed so much…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had met Tassid when he was still a small boy, not yet an
            adult. Despite his significant transformation since then, Tassid was
            elated that his benefactor recognized him.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt felt a bit awkward seeing Tassid so pleased.</p>
          <p>“Ah, well…”</p>
          <p>
            In truth, this version of Tassid was the one imprinted in
            Repenhardt’s memory. How could he not recognize him? But he couldn’t
            just come out and say that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken, observing the joyful reunion of these old friends, tilted
            his head in curiosity.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm? You know each other?”</p>
          <p>“He is the benefactor who guided me to this place, Chieftain.”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken knew well how Tassid had found them, the Blue Bear Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>“Ha! What a coincidence!”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken looked at Repenhardt with renewed interest. Though he had
            already acknowledged him as trustworthy through the Ritual of Hotu,
            the Tassid connection further solidified Repenhardt’s reliability in
            his eyes. Only now did Kalken begin to wonder.
          </p>
          <p>‘Why did someone like him come to find us?’</p>
          <p>
            This was something he should have considered much earlier, but only
            now, after all the fighting and drinking, did it occur to
            him—exemplifying typical orc behavior.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Come to think of it, my wife was giving me some looks earlier,
            wasn’t she?’
          </p>
          <p>
            He now understood his wife’s earlier signals. Kalken asked
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“So, brother, what brings you to these wild lands?”</p>
          <p>Sitting by the campfire, Repenhardt replied to Kalken.</p>
          <p>
            “I wish to offer the Blue Bear Tribe a land better than this to live
            on. For that, I need your help.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Repenhardt then explained the current situation in the Kingdom of
            Crovence and how participating in the war could benefit the orcs by
            gaining new territory. Though Kalken didn’t fully understand, he
            kept tilting his head in curiosity. Rubbing his tusk, he asked.
          </p>
          <p>“So, you’re saying if we go and fight, we’ll get land?”</p>
          <p>“Well, that’s the simplified version, yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt gave a rough explanation of the territory he desired, the
            Viscounty of Gelpein, located in the western part of the Kingdom of
            Crovence. Hearing that most of the land was adjacent to the Gloten
            Mountains, Kalken’s eyes sparkled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do you mean our tribe could live there? Without being slaves to
            humans?”
          </p>
          <p>
            By human standards, the Gloten Mountains were rugged and barren, but
            compared to Deathland, it was a paradise. There were forests,
            flowing streams, frequent rain, and only weak monsters. It was a
            tempting offer.
          </p>
          <p>“But the human army won’t stand idly by,” Kalken said.</p>
          <p>
            He wasn’t afraid of humans himself, but he had the duty to protect
            his tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The human army is numerous. Our warriors are strong, but few. The
            human army is a formidable presence.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That human army will grant you land if you fight alongside them,”
            Repenhardt explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken pondered. The safety of his tribe was at stake, and he
            couldn’t make a hasty decision.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turning his head, he asked Tassid, who had been listening beside
            them, “Tassid, who grew up among humans, what do you think?”
          </p>
          <p>
            If it were up to human standards, such a significant matter
            concerning the tribe’s safety would be discussed quietly among the
            leaders in a secluded room. But orcs had no such concept. Things
            that couldn’t be told to others were bad and shouldn’t be done. Good
            things could be discussed openly anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Tassid had been listening to their conversation from the
            start. After some thought, he responded.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I can trust humans, but I can trust Repenhardt even more. Our
            benefactor would not lie to us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know that much. My concern is that if Brother Repenhardt fails,
            it will jeopardize the safety of our tribe.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken did not doubt Repenhardt’s intentions. However, he was a
            seasoned orc who knew that the world did not always move according
            to one’s good intentions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tassid nodded and added, “We should seek the advice of the Great
            Mother and the Master of Weapons. Their wisdom is needed in this
            matter.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With Kalken’s approval, Tassid left and ran somewhere in the
            village.
          </p>
          <p>
            A short while later, Tassid returned to the campfire accompanied by
            Stalla and a slightly gaunt middle-aged orc. The middle-aged orc
            introduced himself to Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Warrior blessed by the spirit of combat, I am Gralta, the Master of
            Weapons of the Blue Bear Tribe.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The title “Master of Weapons” was the orcs’ term for a blacksmith.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike humans or dwarves, orcs did not have the skills to handle
            iron through casting methods and had to forge all their weapons with
            hammers. Moreover, they lacked the technology to mine and extract
            iron, relying on finding open-pit mines.
          </p>
          <p>
            The existence of blacksmiths who roamed the harsh wilderness,
            teeming with countless monsters, in search of open-pit iron mines
            and who forged lifelong companions with their strength and
            endurance, were as respected as warriors among the orcs. Gralta, the
            Master of Weapons, was one of the key mentors leading the Blue Bear
            Tribe alongside Chieftain Kalken and the Great Mother Stalla.
          </p>
          <p>Looking around at them, Kalken spoke.</p>
          <p>
            “A new brother has introduced a new destiny to us. We must judge
            wisely, for the sake of the tribe!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Both orcs’ eyes gleamed with curiosity as they looked at Repenhardt.

          <p>[ Chapter 118 ]</p>
          <p>
            The next morning, Repenhardt’s group left the Blue Bear Tribe,
            suffering from hangovers. As they drove their horses, Russ
            approached Repenhardt and asked,
          </p>
          <p>“It seems the talk went well, brother.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, they finally decided to support us.”</p>
          <p>
            After much discussion, Kalken and the others agreed with
            Repenhardt’s proposal. The harsh environment of Deathland was
            already causing the numbers of the Blue Bear Tribe to dwindle.
            Although this led to a smaller but elite group, their future seemed
            bleak.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s proposal was indeed risky. If things didn’t go as
            planned, the Blue Bear Tribe might disappear.
          </p>
          <p>There were two choices:</p>
          <p>To slowly die out here?</p>
          <p>Or to boldly challenge the future of their tribe?</p>
          <p>
            Brave Kalken, wise Stalla, and prudent Gralta. The three mentors
            leading the Blue Bear Tribe.
          </p>
          <p>True to their orc nature, they chose the latter.</p>
          <p>
            “After moving the tribe to a safer place, Kalken, Stalla, and a
            hundred orc warriors of the Blue Bear Tribe will join us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite forming an alliance, Kalken couldn’t immediately lead his
            warriors to follow Repenhardt. If the warriors left, the remaining
            orcs of the Blue Bear Tribe would be endangered. Thus, relocating
            the tribe to a safer place was necessary. Crossing Deathland with
            the tribesmen was extremely dangerous, making it impossible without
            the warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There was also the issue of food shortage if the warriors left, as
            there would be no one to hunt. But that was easily resolved.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The meat from the monsters hunted by Tassid and Kalken was immense.
            Were the Turtle Lion and Elder Drake particularly large? The Blue
            Bear Tribe had enough meat to last at least three months.
          </p>
          <p>
            The only issue was preservation, which Repenhardt resolved with a
            long-term preservation spell. This ensured they wouldn’t face any
            food shortage for a while. Although some orcs were wary of magic,
            seeing Repenhardt and Kalken eat the preserved meat reassured them.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Anyway, I wasn’t very confident, but the results exceeded my
            expectations.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt said cheerfully. Holding the reins, Russ glanced back.
          </p>
          <p>“But why is that guy following us?”</p>
          <p>
            A green-skinned orc with a greatsword on his back was following them
            on a massive direwolf, slightly apart from the group. It was Tassid,
            who had joined them that morning.
          </p>

          <p>Repenhardt shrugged.</p>
          <p>
            “Don’t we need to send someone to greet the orcs when they come to
            find us?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Though they could circle around through the northern part of
            Deathland to reach the Gloten Mountains without encountering any
            humans, they would still need a guide from there. A messenger was
            necessary to facilitate communication between Repenhardt and the
            Blue Bear Tribe, and Tassid was chosen for this honorable role.
          </p>
          <p>
            From a human perspective, a messenger is just a swift soldier or a
            good rider, but for orcs, it is different. The orc chosen as the
            messenger must risk their life traversing the dangerous human world
            that treats them as monsters. This job required not only physical
            and mental endurance but also the ability to hide from human eyes
            and fight their way out if needed.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this regard, Tassid was an experienced hunter, skilled in sensing
            and concealing his presence. Besides Kalken and Stalla, he was the
            strongest warrior of the Blue Bear Tribe. Tassid, who was expected
            to become the third warrior of the tribe, was perfect for this
            perilous role. More importantly, Tassid had volunteered for this
            role after meeting Repenhardt again.
          </p>
          <p>Russ tilted his head in confusion.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s not that I don’t understand the need for a messenger, but why
            put an orc in such a dangerous position when I could do it?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt replied with a wry smile.</p>
          <p>
            “I’d prefer that too, but you don’t know Orcish, do you? To
            communicate details, the common language skills of the orcs aren’t
            sufficient. Plus, I can’t go back and forth myself every time
            something happens.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm, that’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            Russ nodded, finally understanding. Apart from Repenhardt, none of
            the others were fit for the role of a messenger.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt gave Russ a complicated look.</p>
          <p>
            He knew that using Russ as a messenger would be much more
            convenient. The excuse about not knowing Orcish was just that, an
            excuse. The orcs’ lack of fluency in the common language was due to
            their oral structure, not a lack of understanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Repenhardt still felt uneasy about letting Russ out of his
            sight. He acknowledged that Russ, who he had met again in this era,
            genuinely followed him, and he felt a brotherly bond with him.
            However…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Damn, I keep seeing Cyrus the Swordmaster’s image overlapping with
            him…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Considering Russ had been one of his strongest enemies in his
            previous life, it was still hard to fully trust him. Though it
            seemed unnecessary, given how Russ had changed to the point of
            worrying about orcs…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No, the truth is, it’s just an excuse. I simply wanted to be with
            Tassid.’
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt inwardly smiled wryly.</p>
          <p>
            In his previous life, Tassid had been one of the Four Heavenly
            Kings.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tassid had been with Repenhardt and Siris even before they founded
            the Antares Empire.
          </p>

          <p>
            Those carefree days of adventuring across the continent with the
            three of them together were some of Repenhardt’s fondest memories.
            Now that Tassid was back by his side, those feelings had been
            rekindled, making him feel incredibly joyful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tassid rode his direwolf, Black King, to join Russ at the front. He
            beat his chest as he looked at Russ.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Karuga Russ! Even if not you, I am strong! Humans do not scare me!”
          </p>
          <p>
            It seemed he had overheard their conversation. Russ, flustered,
            waved his hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No, Sir Tassid… Sir? How should I address you? Anyway, I don’t
            doubt your prowess as a warrior. I apologize for my rudeness.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ, slightly blushing, waved his hands. Seeing this, Repenhardt
            thought to himself,
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Come to think of it, this guy’s personality has changed a lot too.’
          </p>
          <p>Tassid laughed heartily and beat his chest again.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s fine! I appreciate your concern! I look forward to working
            with you, Karuga Russ!”
          </p>
          <p>“I also look forward to it, Sir Tassid.”</p>
          <p>
            After a brief hesitation, Russ decided to address Tassid with the
            title of ‘Sir.’ If Kalken and Stalla were considered the king and
            queen of the Blue Bear Tribe, then their warrior ranks were similar
            to human knights.
          </p>
          <p>
            Laughing, Tassid focused on riding Black King again. Russ, in a
            joking tone, said to Repenhardt,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Elves, dwarves, and now orcs… I wonder if trolls will join us
            soon?”
          </p>
          <p>‘Hmm, sharp fellow…’</p>
          <p>
            Russ might have said it as a joke, but Repenhardt couldn’t help but
            smile wryly again. He was already planning to seek out Guru Attila,
            the great shaman of the trolls, when circumstances allowed. In a
            way, it was indeed foresight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Smiling inwardly, Repenhardt urged his horse forward. Russ and
            Tassid followed, riding side by side on their horses and direwolf.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing his old nemesis, whom he had fought to the death with in his
            past life, now riding amicably alongside him felt surreal. It made
            him realize just how much everything had changed.
          </p>
          <p>‘Yes, I must change everything.’</p>
          <p>
            With renewed resolve, Repenhardt spurred his horse on. Siris,
            Sillan, and Tilla also quickened their pace.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s hurry. We need to return to the Kingdom of Crovence. Hiya!”
          </p>

          <p>
            Five horses and one direwolf began to gallop across the plains of
            Deathland.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>A vast, dark hall filled with shadows.</p>
          <p>
            This hall did not exist in reality. It was an infinite space created
            using the relics of the Silver Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the darkness, a young man with black hair stood. Wearing a pure
            white robe with a silver holy symbol on his chest, he bowed his head
            with a solemn expression, waiting for something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, a pillar of light shot up from the center of the hall.
            Within the pillar, a human figure clad in a white robe appeared. It
            was an old man with a long white beard reaching down to his chest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old man, revealed through a magical projection, addressed the
            young man.
          </p>
          <p>“I commend you for your hard work, Sage Restin.”</p>
          <p>
            Sage Restin, known in the mortal world as Teslon, bowed his head
            respectfully.
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you, Guardian Daos.”</p>
          <p>
            Guardian Daos, the overseer of humanity and a Sage of the Silver
            Age, was among the highest echelon, one of the thirteen Guardians
            who managed all secrets.
          </p>
          <p>Daos looked at Teslon and continued speaking.</p>
          <p>“You handled the matter well. I am satisfied.”</p>
          <p>
            A month ago, under Daos’ command, Teslon had been tasked with
            eliminating those who had explored the Salkana Dungeon. Following
            that, he spent the month erasing all known information about the
            Salkana Ruins and fabricating evidence regarding the exploration
            party. Now, he was reporting to Daos after completing everything.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was nothing,” Teslon replied modestly, handing over a report on
            his recent activities. Instead of paper, the report was stored in a
            magical purple crystal.
          </p>
          <p>
            As he accepted the crystal, the old man spoke in a gentle voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Dangerous knowledge must be maintained under proper management. You
            may think it was nothing, but it is also a part of protecting
            humanity.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I understand,” Teslon answered seriously. Daos held the crystal,
            closed his eyes, and began reading the information within. Watching
            this, Teslon clicked his tongue inwardly.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Hmph, even if I can’t reach that level, I need to quickly rise to a
            position where I can influence them at least.’
          </p>
          <p>
            He had gathered power and information to confront the Demon King. He
            had recruited the Golden Knight Eusus, as well as Stefan and
            Philanence, enhancing their swordsmanship and magical abilities with
            relics from the Silver Age.
          </p>
          <p>
            But it still wasn’t enough. Repenhardt, with Teslon’s own physical
            body and the Demon King’s intellect, was a truly terrifying
            existence.
          </p>
          <p>He needed more power, stronger allies.</p>
          <p>
            Thus, Teslon was highly dissatisfied with his current status. The
            higher his rank within the Sages of Silver, the greater his
            authority. Instead of managing top-tier artifacts, he would gain
            access to relics of absolute power, forbidden in this era. He wished
            he could grab the old man and give a speech about the dangers of the
            Demon King right then and there…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘But talking about reincarnation would just make them think I’m
            insane. For now, I have to protect the hard-earned position of Sage
            of Silver…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Remembering the time he reincarnated into this era and joined the
            Sages of Silver, Teslon clicked his tongue in frustration.

          <p>[ Chapter 119 ]</p>
          <p>
            Teslon, who needed the power to confront Repenhardt, sought out Duke
            Iranard as soon as he emerged into the world. Through the
            information from his previous life, he already knew that Duke
            Iranard was one of the Sages of Silver.
          </p>
          <p>He fabricated a story when he met him.</p>
          <p>
            He claimed that by studying the history of the continent and making
            deductions, he had inferred the existence of a group that managed
            humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, he said he had ‘personally obtained information’ revealing
            that Duke Iranard was one of their members.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was no wonder that Duke Iranard thought of Teslon as a person
            with astonishing intuition and a wise mind, seeing him spout off
            everything he had heard in his previous life as if he had deduced it
            all himself. Considering Teslon’s martial prowess and youth, it was
            too much to eliminate him. As expected, Teslon was accepted into the
            Sages of Silver.
          </p>
          <p>
            The person from his past life who provided this information was none
            other than…
          </p>
          <p>‘Jade Arclight, the Mage of Light.’</p>
          <p>
            This was during the time when Demon King Repenhardt was expanding
            the Antares Empire, and Teslon, the Wandering Fist King, couldn’t
            abandon his homeland, fighting fervently as a vassal of the Vasily
            Kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, he learned about the Sages of Silver from his comrade,
            Jade.
          </p>
          <p>They were said to know all the secrets of the ancient world.</p>
          <p>They were the true successors of the great Silver Age.</p>
          <p>
            They were the ones who knew a history unknown to present-day
            humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through Jade, who was also a member of the Sages of Silver, Teslon
            heard the true history. And it was something that shook the pride
            and foundation of humanity to its core.
          </p>
          <p>
            The great Silver Age was not dominated by humans. The owners of that
            magnificent civilization were elves, who possessed the World Tree,
            and dwarves, who ruled the earth.
          </p>
          <p>So, what did humans do during that era?</p>
          <p>
            If those great ancients were not the ancestors of humanity, then who
            did humans consider their ancestors?
          </p>
          <p>
            This truth, it is said, was unknown even to the Sages of Silver. And
            that alone was a terrifying question enough to shake the identity of
            humanity. Hence, the Sages of Silver had manipulated history over
            the centuries to protect human pride.
          </p>
          <p>One such manipulation was the term ‘Silver Age.’</p>
          <p>
            Teslon had once wondered why the ancient era was called the Silver
            Age. If there was an ancient civilization called the Silver Age,
            shouldn’t there also be a Golden Age, a Bronze Age, or an Iron Age?
            Why did the Silver Age suddenly pop up without any other
            counterparts?
          </p>
          <p>It was through Jade that Teslon finally learned the truth.</p>

          <p>
            Originally, even a thousand years ago, old books had specific names
            for ancient civilizations. These names were given by humans, elves,
            and dwarves who lived in those times.
          </p>
          <p>That civilization was called thus:</p>
          <p>The Eldras Civilization and the Alhatrans Civilization.</p>
          <p>
            Anyone proficient in ancient languages could interpret the meanings
            of those words.
          </p>
          <p>Eldras meant ‘Blessing of Eldia.’</p>
          <p>And Alhatrans meant ‘Grace of Al Port.’</p>
          <p>
            It was clear to anyone that the names of those ancient civilizations
            bore the names of the gods of the elves and dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the Sages of Silver of the past who manipulated this. They
            burned ancient texts and altered history to erase the names of those
            civilizations. It was a massive operation spanning centuries, but as
            humanity flourished and grew stronger, the Sages of Silver were
            ultimately able to complete their task successfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            To erase the truth, they needed to present an equally plausible lie.
            Hence, the term ‘Silver Age’ was introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            – The ancient elves, unlike the elves of today, had short ears and
            all had dazzling silver hair. From the murals in the dungeons, it
            was evident that the ancient elves simply looked like tall humans
            with silver hair. Therefore, most explorers of ruins did not find
            the term ‘Silver Age’ odd when looking at those murals.
            Additionally, the metal predominantly used by the ancient dwarves,
            both then and now, was tin and mithril. Of course, unlike the
            current dwarves, they alloyed mithril with other minerals to create
            superior metals, but the color was clearly silver. Hence, most
            relics were silver in color, and researchers naturally accepted the
            term ‘Silver Age.’
          </p>
          <p>
            In this way, the Sages of Silver had been manipulating information
            from the shadows for countless years to protect humanity’s psyche.
          </p>
          <p>
            When Teslon first heard all this from Jade, he wasn’t particularly
            shocked.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, Teslon still had the straightforward mindset befitting
            the successor of Gym Unbreakable. In other words, he was quite
            ignorant. He thought, “Who cares about the past? Elves and dwarves
            are insignificant now.” So, when he fought against Repenhardt, he
            simply thought, “If I take him down, everything will be fine.”
          </p>
          <p>
            However, after being reborn and inheriting Repenhardt’s superior
            intellect, he reflected on his past life and understood why the
            Sages of Silver went to such lengths to hide history. He had become
            wise enough to comprehend the significance of belonging, tradition,
            and ancestors to humans.
          </p>
          <p>‘And… I also realized what mistakes the Sages of Silver made…’</p>
          <p>
            In front of Stefan or Philanence, Teslon scolded them, telling them
            not to reveal the truth due to their positions. However, he
            personally thought that what the Sages of Silver were doing was
            excessive.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his previous life, the early Antares Empire devastated the
            continent at an astonishing speed. And it wasn’t merely due to
            Repenhardt’s powerful magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sage of Silver manipulated history to preserve the pride of
            humanity. Consequently, humanity, brimming with pride, succeeded in
            subjugating other races and seizing control of the world. The Sage
            of Silver undoubtedly acted in a way worthy of being called the
            guardian of humanity.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, their interference had now turned into excessive
            overprotection.
          </p>
          <p>
            Due to the extreme manipulation of information by the Sage of
            Silver, humanity had become ignorant of other races.
          </p>
          <p>Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Trolls.</p>

          <p>
            Although they had now fallen to the status of slaves, they once
            contended for dominance over the continent with humans. These races
            harbored the potential danger of reawakening the power of their
            ancestors at any moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, humans dismissed them as inherently inferior beings and no one
            sought to learn about them. The ideological manipulation aimed at
            boosting human pride had gone too far, resulting in humanity
            becoming mentally complacent despite ruling the entire continent.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was the reason why, in the early days of the Antares Empire,
            human kingdoms crumbled so easily. The other races invaded with
            terrifying momentum, but humans scoffed at the idea of mere slaves
            posing a threat, and they all perished as a result. By the time the
            Antares Empire was established and humans finally realized the truth
            and heightened their vigilance, three kingdoms had already fallen.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘In the end, we utilized our numerical superiority to achieve
            victory, but the damage was immense…’
          </p>
          <p>
            At that time, Daos, who had been reviewing the reports, called for
            Teslon.
          </p>
          <p>“Well done, Sage Restin.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Guardian Daos.”</p>
          <p>“Then, you may withdraw.”</p>
          <p>After bowing his head, Teslon recited the designated slogan.</p>
          <p>“Then, everything is for the protection of humanity.”</p>
          <p>
            Disappearing with a flash of light, Daos also solemnly received the
            slogan.
          </p>
          <p>“Everything is for the protection of humanity.”</p>
          <p>
            Daos’s figure completely vanished. As the pillar of light
            extinguished, the hall was once again filled with darkness. Teslon,
            left alone in the darkness, gazed at the empty space where Daos had
            been and muttered bitterly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Protection of humanity… But all the actions you have taken in the
            name of preserving human pride and dignity have ultimately made the
            current humans weak and foolish…”
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Three months had passed since the death of the former King Gotrin I
            and his heir, Telion. Now, the Kingdom of Crovence was divided into
            two factions.
          </p>
          <p>The first faction supported Carsus von Fernando.</p>
          <p>
            Led by the Fernando ducal family and the Marquis of Brozen, this
            faction, backed by local lords and noble families, claimed that
            Carsus was the true king. With two Aura wielders under his command
            and an army of fifteen thousand, Carsus was currently the closest
            person to the throne of Crovence.
          </p>
          <p>The second faction supported Yubel Ren Crovence.</p>
          <p>
            This young man, eighteen years old this year, was born to the former
            King Gotrin I and his concubine. Yubel, whose maternal family was
            the Feonin family, the kingdom’s greatest merchants, received the
            support of the merchant-born nobility, and a few conservative nobles
            who valued royal tradition also lent their hands to Yubel. Despite
            the blemish on his lineage, it was an undeniable fact that Yubel was
            the only legitimate son of the former King Gotrin I.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, with no Aura users under his command and a great famine
            sweeping the land causing mercenaries to leave, Yubel was left with
            only about three thousand troops, putting him at a considerable
            disadvantage in the war of succession.
          </p>

          <p>
            Yet, the reason Carsus could not yet call himself king was because
            Prince Yubel’s side possessed the Crovence crown and the royal seal.
          </p>
          <p>
            The King of Crovence had to own the crown and seal and hold the
            coronation ceremony in the sacred hall of the palace, Brastina, to
            be recognized as the true king. While Carsus had subdued the royal
            capital Crotene and controlled the sacred hall, he had yet to obtain
            the crown and seal.
          </p>
          <p>But even this was only a matter of time.</p>
          <p>
            The Carsus faction had contacted the Taoban Trading Company,
            spending a large sum of money to secure military provisions,
            preparing to resume the war. In contrast, Prince Yubel’s faction had
            no further resources. Everyone watching the war of succession
            already predicted Carsus’ victory.
          </p>
          <p>“So it was already a fight won…”</p>
          <p>
            In a reception room of the gray stone tower, Count Piterran examined
            a document with a troubled expression. This middle-aged man, with
            brittle-looking brown hair and blue eyes, was part of the Brozen
            Marquessate faction on Prince Carsus’ side. Due to his territory’s
            proximity, he had been tasked with scouting the movements of Prince
            Yubel’s forces, who had retreated to the Viscounty of Delphia.
          </p>
          <p>
            The document in his hand contained information from his spy
            infiltrated in the Viscounty of Delphia. It detailed how Prince
            Yubel’s side had acquired a new ally, securing a vast amount of
            military provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            “After all the effort to cut off their funds, what is this now?”
          </p>
          <p>Count Piterran clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>
            They had experienced firsthand in the early days of the civil war
            how terrifying a weapon money could become when given to merchants.
            Hence, the Carsus faction seized the opportunity brought by the
            great famine, even receiving help from the Principality of Chatan,
            to cut off the flow of funds to Prince Yubel’s merchants. Confident
            that there was no way for them to secure more provisions, a sudden
            ally appeared supplying grain?
          </p>
          <p>‘Tch, what luck you have, Prince Yubel.’</p>
          <p>
            According to the information, the amount of provisions was worth a
            staggering 100,000 gold coins. If such provisions reached Prince
            Yubel, it wouldn’t turn the war in his favor completely, but it
            would certainly become a significant headache.
          </p>
          <p>Count Piterran’s mind worked quickly.</p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know how they found such an ally, but I can’t just sit back
            and watch.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a basic principle of warfare to cut off supplies. Moreover,
            such a quantity of grain was a considerable treasure in the current
            Crovence Kingdom. They couldn’t simply let such a valuable resource
            go. The Carsus army was also struggling with supplies.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If I can seize this much provision, the credit I’d gain would be
            significant, and my position would rise considerably.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Though initially surprised, he realized it was an unparalleled
            opportunity. Delighted, Count Piterran began formulating a plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Carsus army also traded grain with the Taoban Trading Company.
            Hence, they couldn’t attack while the Taoban Trading Company was
            managing the grain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, Count Piterran decided the attack would be after Prince
            Yubel’s side received the grain from the Taoban Trading Company and
            passed through the western gateway city of the Crovence Kingdom,
            Kadvar. With the entire kingdom suffering from famine, the grain
            from the Taoban Trading Company was literally everyone’s lifeline.
            If they antagonized the Trading Company, it would likely upset other
            neutral nobles.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmph, cowardly bastards.”</p>
          <p>
            Count Piterran muttered a curse as he thought of the neutral nobles.
            To him, they were as detestable as Prince Yubel’s forces for not
            participating in this sacred war to support the true king.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those maintaining neutrality were primarily families of Aura users,
            like Sir Hartsbergen, the commander of the Royal Knights. Currently,
            there were five Aura users in the Crovence Kingdom, and three of
            them remained neutral in the civil war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their stated reason was that they had sworn allegiance to the king
            and could not support either side until a proper coronation. But
            Count Piterran had a good guess at their true intentions.
          </p>
          <p>‘They must feel secure because they are Aura users.’</p>
          <p>
            When ordinary nobles declared neutrality, they would naturally incur
            the displeasure of whoever became the king. However, Aura users were
            precious at a national level. Unless they were enemies, the king
            would have no choice but to embrace them. Knowing this, they
            confidently declared neutrality to preserve their family’s power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grumbling, Count Piterran continued devising his ‘provision seizure
            plan’. Then, he called for his attendant and gave an order.
          </p>
          <p>“Tell everyone to prepare for deployment!”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 120 ]</p>
          <p>Thermania Highway.</p>
          <p>
            This main road, traversing the southern part of the Crovence
            Kingdom, started from the western gateway city of Kadva and extended
            to the eastern border at the Gloten Mountains. Unlike the well-paved
            roads of the Principality of Chatan or the Kingdom of Graim, the
            Thermania Highway, worn by years of footsteps and carriage wheels,
            was one of Crovence Kingdom’s primary trade routes.
          </p>
          <p>A long procession of carriages stretched along this highway.</p>
          <p>
            Hundreds of oxen and horses pulled the heavily laden carriages,
            their drivers, both elf and orc slaves, holding the reins.
            Surrounding them, about a hundred soldiers escorted the procession.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sounds of horses neighing and oxen lowing echoed softly across
            the tranquil highway.
          </p>
          <p>“Moo!”</p>
          <p>“Neigh…”</p>
          <p>And there were those watching this scene from afar.</p>
          <p>
            Approximately one kilometer away from the carriage procession,
            hidden within a nameless small forest near the Thermania Highway, a
            group of soldiers concealed themselves. This was the Count of
            Piterran’s army, ambushing to seize the prince Yubel’s military
            supplies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Observing the carriage procession through the thicket, Count
            Piterran clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is… Surely Prince Yubel’s side understands the importance of
            these supplies? And yet, they have barely a hundred men as an
            escort?”
          </p>
          <p>
            A young knight standing beside him, Sir Meyer, Piterran’s adjutant,
            shrugged and replied.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Considering their circumstances, it would be difficult for them to
            deploy a large force.”
          </p>
          <p>“Even so, I expected at least five hundred men…”</p>
          <p>Count Piterran muttered, furrowing his brow.</p>
          <p>
            Having obtained information about the military supplies, Count
            Piterran had first sent a messenger to the Mage Tower to seek
            posthumous approval for his expedition from Prince Carsus. He then
            immediately mobilized his troops and rushed to this location.
          </p>
          <p>
            A student of military strategy, Count Piterran estimated that Prince
            Yubel’s forces numbered roughly twenty knights and five hundred
            infantry. Given the importance of these supplies, it would not be
            excessive to deploy all three thousand troops. However, doing so
            risked leaving Delphia and nearby territories, the main base,
            vulnerable. Hence, five hundred men seemed the practical limit.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Piterran also mobilized all his available forces to ensure a
            decisive victory. He led thirty knights and eight hundred infantry.
            Winning the battle and capturing the supplies would be ideal, but
            even if the enemy’s resistance was fierce, his force was sufficient
            to burn the supplies and retreat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, the enemy’s numbers were far smaller than expected. While this
            increased the likelihood of victory, it was suspiciously unexpected,
            making him wary instead of pleased.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ve already sent reliable soldiers to scout the surroundings.
            There are definitely no hidden forces…”
          </p>
          <p>
            As Count Piterran pondered, Sir Meyer offered his counsel in a
            serious tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It would be wise to examine their composition more closely, just in
            case.”
          </p>
          <p>“You’re right. Sir Meyer, could you summon Mage Herrot?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
          <p>
            Soon, an elderly man in a brown robe approached the Count. He was
            Herrot, the mage of the Piterran family. The Count instructed him to
            cast a farsight spell. Herrot poured water into a large basin and
            waited for it to settle. As he chanted the spell, the detailed image
            of the carriage procession appeared on the water’s surface.
          </p>

          <p>After completing the incantation, Herrot spoke confidently.</p>
          <p>
            “There is no resistance to the farsight spell. It seems there are no
            mages among them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Examining the carriage procession as if it were right before him,
            Piterran narrowed his eyes. He muttered, “This is strange.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There were no knights in sight. Everyone was either walking on foot
            or riding on the carriages. Only two individuals were mounted, and
            one of them was a fierce-looking orc, not a human knight, likely a
            former gladiator slave.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other mounted individual was human but did not appear to be a
            knight. He was not dressed for mounted combat. He wore half-plate
            armor with a single sword at his waist, lacking the lances,
            javelins, or shields typical of knights. He looked more like a
            swordsman than a cavalryman.
          </p>
          <p>‘Is that all their cavalry?’</p>
          <p>
            It made no sense. Moreover, his confusion deepened as he observed
            the hundred escort soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hundred escort soldiers were marching in a line beside the
            carriage procession. They all wore large robes with hoods pulled
            over their heads. They carried long weapons such as axes, spears,
            and hammers. Upon closer inspection through the farsight spell, most
            of them appeared quite small in stature.
          </p>
          <p>‘Such small soldiers?’</p>
          <p>
            Count Piterran clicked his tongue. It seemed they were so short on
            manpower that they had conscripted children who had not yet fully
            grown.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching the vision with him, Sir Meyer offered his own conjecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Perhaps Prince Yubel’s forces believe this information did not
            leak. They might think no attack will come. In that case, the only
            threat to the procession would be starving refugees. Even young
            boys, if covered in large robes and armed, would appear as soldiers
            and deter refugees from attacking them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Isn’t that too much of a gamble? Considering the importance of
            those supplies, they should have at least three hundred regular
            soldiers escorting them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “You might think that because you have the luxury, my lord, but from
            their perspective, it’s difficult to spare even that.”
          </p>
          <p>Sir Meyer shook his head.</p>
          <p>
            “Prince Yubel’s side can’t afford to split their forces right now.
            They already have limited troops, and if they split them, our army
            could invade and cause a disaster. Prince Carsus isn’t refraining
            from advancing immediately because he’s afraid of losing, is he?
            It’s essentially a won war already; he’s conserving his strength to
            minimize our casualties.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            “And they can’t afford to abandon the supplies either. So, they
            probably chose this desperate strategy, hoping for the best…”
          </p>
          <p>Count Piterran nodded at Sir Meyer’s logical explanation.</p>
          <p>“You’re right, Sir Meyer.”</p>
          <p>
            They had thoroughly scouted the surroundings, and the farsight spell
            had confirmed the main force’s situation. It was certain that there
            were no traps. So, it was likely, as Sir Meyer suggested, that they
            had devised this desperate strategy, relying on luck.
          </p>
          <p>“It seems Prince Yubel’s situation is worse than I thought.”</p>
          <p>
            Clicking his tongue, Count Piterran ordered the attack. The knights,
            who had been lying in wait, eagerly awaited the command. Mounted on
            their horses, with their visors down and lances ready, Count
            Piterran addressed his knights.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The enemy consists of pitiable boy soldiers. They will flee in
            panic if we scare them enough. Show some restraint.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The knights, not intending to engage in a massacre, armed themselves
            with smiles on their faces. With a light-hearted spirit akin to
            going on a picnic, Count Piterran shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Charge, everyone!”</p>

          <p>
            Count Piterran and thirty knights burst out of the forest, their
            horses’ hooves thundering as they charged towards the carriage
            procession. The infantry followed closely behind.
          </p>
          <p>Thud-thud-thud-thud!</p>
          <p>
            With the deafening roar of hooves shaking the ground, the knights
            closed the kilometer gap in an instant, launching a surprise attack
            on the procession. Count Piterran raised his lance and shouted
            loudly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “In the name of the true king, Prince Carsus, I command you! Drop
            your weapons and kneel!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Mounted on massive horses and clad in thick steel armor, the knights
            were like moving fortresses to ordinary infantry, possessing an
            overwhelming force that was nearly impossible to counter. With
            thirty knights charging, there should be no courage left in the
            enemy. As Count Piterran was assured of his victory, something
            strange caught his eye.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>No one knelt.</p>
          <p>No one ran away.</p>
          <p>
            Instead, all the infantrymen raised their weapons, pulling back
            their hoods as if they had been waiting for this moment.
          </p>
          <p>“Hahaha!”</p>
          <p>“You’ve come!”</p>
          <p>“We’ve been waiting for you, bastards!”</p>
          <p>
            The voices that came from those presumed to be young boys were
            surprisingly deep and resonant. Seeing their faces under the hoods,
            covered in thick beards rather than youthful features, Count
            Piterran shouted in shock.
          </p>
          <p>“…Dwarves?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“Uwaaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            The dwarves let out a resounding battle cry and charged towards the
            thirty knights. These dwarves, standing just over a meter tall,
            charged fearlessly at the massive horses and knights instead of
            fleeing.
          </p>
          <p>One of the knights muttered in disbelief.</p>
          <p>“Are they collectively insane…?”</p>
          <p>
            It was an astonishing sight. However, it wasn’t something to be
            feared. After all, they were just dwarves—a slight improvement over
            boy soldiers but still merely a lowly slave race.
          </p>
          <p>Count Piterran muttered in shock.</p>
          <p>“Who in their right mind would use groundhogs as soldiers?”</p>
          <p>Riding at the forefront, Sir Meyer sneered.</p>
          <p>
            “These fools must have lost their minds, thinking they could fight
            instead of dig!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing the dwarves, with their short legs, charging at the mounted
            knights was both comical and astonishing. Sir Meyer, who had closed
            the distance in an instant, extended his lance towards a dwarf armed
            with a halberd at the front of the group. He intended to skewer him
            in one thrust.
          </p>
          <p>“Ha!”</p>

          <p>
            At the moment he let out his battle cry and thrust his lance, the
            target suddenly vanished.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Meyer, unable to comprehend what had just happened, had a
            bewildered expression on his face when his consciousness was
            abruptly cut off.
          </p>
          <p>“…Ah?”</p>
          <p>
            Sir Meyer’s head flew into the air, spraying blood. Count Piterran
            cried out in horror.
          </p>
          <p>“Meyer!”</p>
          <p>
            It was an unbelievable sight. The dwarf with the halberd had deftly
            dodged the lance at the last second and then leapt over three meters
            to behead Sir Meyer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Meyer’s headless body continued to ride for a short distance
            before tumbling off the horse. It all happened in an instant. The
            expression on the severed head still bore a look of confusion, as if
            Meyer hadn’t even realized he was about to die.
          </p>
          <p>‘How did he do that in one strike? And that leap…’</p>
          <p>
            The shock of seeing a dwarf perform such a feat was overwhelming.
            The sheer agility and power displayed were beyond anything Count
            Piterran had imagined.
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Piterran was in a state of confusion. It would have been
            astonishing for a mere human to make such a leap, but for a dwarf to
            accomplish it with those short legs was unthinkable!
          </p>
          <p>
            Wasn’t that an extraordinary movement reminiscent of an aura user?
          </p>
          <p>“This… this can’t be happening…”</p>
          <p>
            In the meantime, two other dwarves at the forefront swiftly cut down
            two knights with similar agile movements. The knights began to
            panic.
          </p>
          <p>“What is that?”</p>
          <p>“How can this be happening?”</p>
          <p>
            In an instant, the lives of three esteemed knights had been lost in
            vain. Everyone was startled by the sight of these dwarves flying
            through the air to the height of mounted knights. The other dwarves
            also began to attack the knights.
          </p>
          <p>“Yah-cha-cha!”</p>
          <p>“Let’s slice them up!”</p>
          <p>“Come at us, humans!”</p>
          <p>
            Fortunately, it seemed that only three dwarves possessed such
            terrifying leaping ability. However, the other dwarves were no less
            formidable. Instead of jumping, they fearlessly threw themselves in
            front of the charging horses. The knights were increasingly
            bewildered.
          </p>
          <p>“What are these creatures!”</p>
          <p>“These lunatics!”</p>
          <p>
            Despite their confusion, the knights swung their spears and swords
            as usual.
          </p>
          <p>
            When facing infantry, merely riding the horse would typically yield
            significant results. Advancing with thundering hooves and sweeping
            left and right with spears or swords would usually cut down the
            infantry like harvested wheat.
          </p>
          <p>
            That common sense did not apply here. The dwarves skillfully evaded
            the stomping hooves while swinging their axes. Each time, the
            horses’ bellies were torn open, spilling their guts and causing the
            knights to fall. Before the dismounted knights could regain their
            senses, a heavy hammer crushed their heads.
          </p>
          <p>
            What should have been a suicidal act was anything but, and none of
            the dwarves showed any signs of tension or fear. They fought with
            calm expressions, murmuring to themselves.
          </p>
          <p>“We can’t match the Kadamite, but…”</p>
          <p>“What’s the big deal? We’ve always fought bigger guys anyway.”</p>
          <p>
            “Riding a horse and swinging a sword isn’t much different from
            fighting a centaur, is it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            They dodged the horses’ hooves, parried the knights’ attacks, and
            counterattacked with incredible proficiency, as if they had done it
            thousands of times. In just a few minutes, more than twenty knights
            had lost their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            The blood of the fallen knights soaked the earth. At the horrific
            sight, Count Piterran cried out in despair.
          </p>
          <p>“What in the world is happening!”</p>
