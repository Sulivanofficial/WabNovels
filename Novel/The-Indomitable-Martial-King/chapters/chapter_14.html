          <p>[ Chapter 131 ]</p>
          <p>“Krugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Spirius, who faced the Blade Aura, let out a groan. At the moment
            the auras clashed, a subtle force permeated through his opponent’s
            Blade Aura, striking his arms. Russ smirked.
          </p>
          <p>“I learned this from Miss Stalla!”</p>
          <p>
            More accurately, he had stolen it. Naturally, Spirius couldn’t
            understand what was being said. With a grimace, he swung his sword
            even more violently.
          </p>
          <p>“I won’t lose to a brat like this!”</p>
          <p>
            Spirius put all his strength into his sword. The red Blade Aura grew
            thicker, shining like a massive pillar of light. He intended to cut
            his opponent down with a single blow.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh?”</p>
          <p>
            Russ’s eyes gleamed as he swung his sword erratically in response.
            Numerous afterimages of his sword appeared, and dozens of blue auras
            surged towards Spirius.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate techniques of the heavy sword and the illusion sword,
            executed by two knights, flew at each other. At the moment their
            strikes collided, Spirius’s eyes widened. Most of the blue aura that
            met his sword vanished into nothingness.
          </p>
          <p>‘An illusion!’</p>
          <p>
            All the attacks that emitted powerful waves of aura were fake. The
            real Blade Aura, possessing true power, silently and stealthily dug
            into his sides. Spirius screamed internally.
          </p>
          <p>‘I’ve been deceived!’</p>
          <p>
            The young Aura User in front of him had separated the presence and
            substance of the aura the moment he performed the illusion sword,
            deceiving even the senses of Spirius, an Aura User. It was an
            unimaginable and terrifying technique.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the weighty red aura pierced through empty air, blood spurted
            from Spirius’s shoulders.
          </p>
          <p>“Keough!”</p>
          <p>
            With blood gushing out, Spirius dropped his sword and fell from his
            horse. The Carsus camp stirred with surprised exclamations from all
            around.
          </p>
          <p>“Sir Spirius!”</p>
          <p>“My God! Sir Spirius!”</p>
          <p>
            Falling from his horse, Spirius dangled his arms and looked at Russ
            in shock.
          </p>
          <p>
            As an Aura User himself, he understood what Russ had done. However,
            understanding how it was possible was beyond him. Russ, an absurdly
            talented genius, could steal aura manipulation techniques just by
            observing, but for an ordinary Aura User like Spirius, such a feat
            was utterly impossible.
          </p>
          <p>
            “How does someone his age possess such an incredible technique….”
          </p>
          <p>
            In the despair of his lifelong training being rendered futile,
            Spirius stared blankly at Russ. Even after achieving victory, the
            young man did not rejoice; instead, he looked down at Spirius with a
            calm, collected gaze. Not only did he possess unparalleled skill,
            but he also had a composure far beyond his years.
          </p>
          <p>Of course, this was a misunderstanding on Spirius’s part.</p>
          <p>‘Damn, I failed again, Phantom Divide.’</p>
          <p>
            Russ was not actually cold-hearted; he was feeling melancholic.
            Spirius was awed by Russ’s skill of separating presence from
            substance, but in truth, it was merely the result of failing the
            Phantom Divide, a technique meant to transcend space.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Damn it, I can manage everything else, so why is the success rate
            of this so low?’
          </p>

          <p>
            Well, to others, it looked like he wore an arrogant and proud
            expression, as if defeating someone like Spirius was nothing to be
            happy about.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Letting out a humiliated groan, Spirius swiftly kicked off the
            ground and fled back to his formation. Russ simply watched with a
            stern face, as if Spirius was not even worth cutting down.
          </p>
          <p>
            In reality, he was momentarily disappointed due to his failed
            technique, causing him to miss the timing for a follow-up attack.
            But how could onlookers know the inner details? The sight of Spirius
            fleeing miserably contrasted sharply with Russ’s proud stance.
            Prince Yubel’s army chanted his name in unison.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow!”</p>
          <p>“Cyrus! Cyrus! Cyrus!”</p>
          <p>“Long live Sir Cyrus!”</p>
          <p>
            It was a moment when the fame of Aura User Cyrus resonated across
            the continent.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Carsus sprang to his feet. The sight of Sir Spirius’s miserable
            defeat clearly showed his soldiers were unsettled. If their morale
            dropped any further, they would be defeated without even a proper
            fight.
          </p>
          <p>He sent a hand signal and shouted.</p>
          <p>“All troops! Charge!”</p>
          <p>A knight drew his sword and cried out bravely.</p>
          <p>“For the true king! Let us go, Brozen Knights!”</p>
          <p>“Ooooooh!”</p>
          <p>
            To boost their fallen morale, the entire knight order roared
            courageously and began to gallop. Prince Yubel also raised his hand
            and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Everyone, charge!”</p>
          <p>Russ thrust his blade aura into the sky and bellowed.</p>
          <p>“Let’s go! Brave warriors!”</p>
          <p>
            The orc warriors of the Blue Bear Tribe, positioned at the
            forefront, let out a collective roar and drove their direwolves
            forward.
          </p>
          <p>“Graaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            With the sound of thundering hooves shaking the earth, the knights
            of both armies simultaneously charged onto the battlefield. Waves of
            steel clashed from both directions, creating a blood-soaked tide in
            the middle of the plain. The leading orc cavalry sang the song of
            valor as they hurled their swords.
          </p>
          <p>“Fight until your heart bursts!”</p>
          <p>“Fight until your heart bursts!”</p>
          <p>“The spirit of the warriors will bless us!”</p>
          <p>
            Five hundred Brozen knights and a hundred orc warriors of the Blue
            Bear Tribe clashed. The battle, even grander than majestic, ended
            with the orc warriors’ overwhelming victory. Wielding their Spirits
            Weapons, the orc warriors mercilessly cut down the knights and
            ravaged the battlefield.
          </p>
          <p>“Arrrgh!”</p>
          <p>“These monsters!”</p>

          <p>
            The screams of the Brozen knights echoed across the battlefield.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Brozen Knights, known to be on par with the Fernando Knights
            within the Crovence Kingdom, shared the same fate. This meant that
            the Brozen Knights were no different from the Fernando Knights in
            terms of skills and information about the orcs. Therefore, their
            destiny could only follow that of the Fernando Knights who defended
            Sinai Fortress.
          </p>
          <p>
            Following them, the human knights of Prince Yubel’s army, emboldened
            by courage, charged into the enemy lines. Observing the battlefield,
            Carsus ground his teeth and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Do not retreat! Their numbers are still few! Form ranks and unhorse
            them!”
          </p>
          <p>
            To counter the knights’ charge, the infantry of Carsus’s army had
            been thoroughly trained in tactics aimed at targeting the horses of
            the knights. Although the success rate was only about ten percent,
            it was still far better than letting the soldiers face the knights’
            charge unprepared. True to their training, Carsus’s army quickly
            formed ranks, executing the practiced formations swiftly.
          </p>
          <p>At that moment, Carsus’s expression hardened.</p>
          <p>‘Unhorse them?’</p>
          <p>
            His soldiers were indeed well-trained in tactics against mounted
            knights. But were those mounts horses?
          </p>
          <p>“Arrrooo!”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken’s direwolf howled thunderously, savagely tearing through the
            soldiers. Stalla’s direwolf followed, swatting away obstructing
            soldiers with its front paws. Despite forming solid ranks, the
            soldiers were defenseless. They had learned to unhorse opponents,
            not to dismount those riding wolves!
          </p>
          <p>“Aaagh!”</p>
          <p>“Help me!”</p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the visual impact between horses and wolves was vastly
            different in terms of fear. Which would be scarier, an agitated
            horse or a snarling wolf? And unlike horses, the soldiers were not
            accustomed to wolves.
          </p>
          <p>
            The formation collapsed in an instant. Arrows rained down on
            Carsus’s troops like a deathly shower, followed by an overwhelming
            charge of infantry.
          </p>
          <p>“Kill them!”</p>
          <p>“Slaughter them all!”</p>
          <p>
            Ten thousand troops of Carsus were pathetically outmatched by the
            three thousand of Prince Yubel’s army. Leading the charge were six
            streams of dazzling aura. Even a single one would be despairing, but
            with six, it was impossible for their morale not to plummet. Carsus
            gnashed his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn it! So the rumors were true!”</p>
          <p>
            With six aura users at the forefront, Prince Yubel’s army
            overwhelmingly dominated the battlefield. Carsus yelled at his
            lieutenant.
          </p>
          <p>“What on earth is Sir Saide doing?”</p>
          <p>
            Simultaneously with the full advance of his army, Carsus had
            detached two thousand troops to form a separate unit targeting the
            enemy’s left flank. No matter how strong their charge was, the
            numerical inferiority remained unchanged. With overwhelmingly
            superior numbers, this separate unit would aim to strike the main
            force and cut off Prince Yubel’s head, securing their victory.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a textbook tactic for the large army of Carsus. Any
            strategist would praise Carsus for expertly deploying his soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, it wasn’t working. The lieutenant responded in a trembling
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well… Sir Saide is unable to break through the enemy’s main force.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That’s impossible! Their main force consists of only about two
            hundred soldiers!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Carsus muttered as if in a nightmare. Incredibly, the two
            thousand-strong detachment led by Sir Saide was being blocked by a
            mere two hundred soldiers guarding Prince Yubel’s main force. The
            reason half of those two hundred were none other than the dwarf
            warriors of the Grand Forge.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Haha! You see, we might have short legs, but we can’t be poked
            around easily!”
          </p>
          <p>“Standing our ground and holding out is our specialty!”</p>

          <p>
            Dwarf warriors lacked mobility, but when they formed ranks in one
            spot, their defense was akin to that of a moving fortress. Despite
            the waves of cavalry and infantry, they did not budge and held the
            main force firmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a continuous destruction of common sense. The orc warriors’
            superior mobility, the dwarven warriors’ overwhelming defense, and
            the elves’ wide-ranging offensive capabilities were all in play.
          </p>
          <p>“Burn, my fiery friend!”</p>
          <p>
            Each time the elves shouted, Ignatius, the giant of fire, revealed
            his magnificent form and incinerated the soldiers. Deserters emerged
            amidst the screams. Although the Carsus army’s mages tried to cast
            spells against the spirits…
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>“Another failure!”</p>
          <p>
            Watching his fellow mage collapse, coughing up blood, Gort, the head
            of the mage unit, screamed. Since earlier, something had been
            interfering with the mana flow, blocking their magic attempts.
            Despite feeling the disruptions in their mana circuits, Gort, like a
            true mage, wondered.
          </p>
          <p>‘How powerful must the mage disrupting us be to cause this?’</p>
          <p>
            Already, twenty mages had been unable to cast spells, continuously
            interrupted. For this to be possible, there must be a tremendously
            powerful mage on the enemy side, at least of the 8th or 9th circle.
          </p>
          <p>And for a mage of that caliber…</p>
          <p>
            “No, if they have such skill, why not just cast high-level spells
            instead of this troublesome interference?”
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, I have the skill, but not enough mana yet.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, who had just blocked another spell, smirked bitterly. He
            could easily guess what the enemy mages were thinking.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had been observing the flow of mana from the mages for a while
            now, interrupting the flow to break their spells whenever they tried
            something. Once a spell was cast, it couldn’t be stopped, but if it
            was before activation, he could cut it off in advance.
          </p>
          <p>
            In short, it was a delicate act that required predicting what spell
            the opponent would use. It wasn’t a matter of needing a high circle
            but rather exceptional insight, mana control, and magical sensing
            abilities, making it the perfect method for the current Repenhardt,
            who had low mana but high mastery.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Repenhardt was keeping the enemy mages in check, the mages of
            Prince Yubel’s army were freely launching fireballs and lightning
            strikes on the battlefield. They cast their spells with excitement,
            all the while sending looks of awe at Repenhardt for his seemingly
            impossible actions.
          </p>
          <p>“Is Siris doing well?”</p>
          <p>
            Blocking yet another spell, Repenhardt glanced stealthily to the
            other side of the battlefield. Though too busy with spell-breaking
            to cast a farsight spell, his basic vision was already extraordinary
            as an Aura User. Focusing his mind, he could see her wildly fighting
            among the elves in the distance.
          </p>
          <p>
            “My friend Sarana, I call upon you in the name of our friendship….”
          </p>
          <p>
            Once again, Siris had summoned the wind spirit, Sarana, and was
            freely ‘stepping on’ it to move up and down through the air over the
            battlefield. As expected, the spirits seemed to have the memory of a
            goldfish; they grimaced every time they were stepped on but still
            faithfully appeared when summoned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Blood splattered and screams erupted every time she soared into the
            air. Whenever her scimitar swung, cries of agony filled the air as
            the terrified enemies fled.
          </p>
          <p>“Witch!”</p>
          <p>“The elf witch is killing people!”</p>
          <p>
            Her presence, possessing exceptional martial skills compared to
            other elves, stood out even amidst the chaos of the battlefield. It
            seemed that once this war ended, Siris’s name would also be widely
            known among the people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swords clashed, screams and groans echoed. Witnessing the gruesome
            battlefield and the horrifying sight of his own troops, Carsus
            eventually raised the flag.
          </p>
          <p>“Order the retreat….”</p>
          <p>
            Even amidst despair, Carsus calmly commanded his troops to begin
            retreating. It was such a flawless command that Prince Yubel’s army
            dared not pursue. No matter how great their victory, their numerical
            disadvantage meant that a pursuit could lead to their forces being
            divided and defeated in detail.
          </p>
          <p>The supreme commander, Yubel, raised his sword and shouted.</p>
          <p>“Cheer! This is our victory!”</p>
          <p>
            Knights and soldiers drenched in blood simultaneously raised their
            weapons and shouted with all their might. The triumphant cries
            echoed across the plain.
          </p>
          <p>“Wooaahhh!”</p>
          <p>“Yaaahhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Later, historians of the Crovence Kingdom would name this battle the
            Battle of Redant, marking it as a significant victory for Prince
            Yubel’s army, leaving behind numerous bodies of Carsus’s troops.

          <p>[ Chapter 132 ]</p>
          <p>
            The forces of Carsus retreated to the capital, Krotin, leaving only
            about three thousand troops behind. Prince Yubel’s army, having
            achieved a great victory, did not march directly to the capital but
            headed towards Count Hendrik’s castle located near the plains of
            Redant.
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Hendrik, who had been driven from his territory for siding
            with Prince Yubel, controlled most of the granary region in the
            Redant plains. Having regained his land, Count Hendrik wept with
            joy, but the residents trembled with fear at the sight of the
            numerous soldiers approaching. With public sentiment already at its
            lowest due to a severe famine, the fear of harsh exploitation loomed
            large.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Prince Yubel’s army, which had ample grain supplies, did
            not resort to plunder. Instead, they distributed grain to the
            starving residents, stabilizing the public sentiment. This wasn’t
            because the nobles on Yubel’s side were particularly concerned with
            the welfare of the residents, but rather, many being former
            merchants, they acted with a calculated pragmatism. With sufficient
            military provisions, it was more advantageous to win over the
            populace by generosity.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a result, celebrations were held throughout Hendrik’s territory
            in honor of Prince Yubel’s victory. Both soldiers and residents
            praised Yubel’s name loudly as they ate and drank.
          </p>
          <p>“Long live Prince Yubel!”</p>
          <p>“Our true king!”</p>
          <p>
            Watching the scene from the balcony of Count Hendrik’s castle, Yubel
            smirked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “These people who were cheering for Carsus just yesterday change
            their attitudes so easily, Grandfather.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Frankly speaking, comparing the popularity of Carsus and Yubel was
            almost insulting to Yubel, as Carsus had overwhelmingly more
            support. That it had shifted so dramatically was astonishing…
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Feonin, standing beside him, spoke with a satisfied
            expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            “A true king illuminates the path even in the darkest of times. The
            brilliance of Your Highness as the rightful king has opened the eyes
            of those blinded by delusion. How could they not chant Your
            Highness’s name?”
          </p>
          <p>
            His words flowed smoothly, as if his mouth were greased. Yubel
            sneered.
          </p>
          <p>“Am I a bonfire? What brilliance…”</p>
          <p>
            To the common folk, the best king is simply the one who can feed
            them on time. Despite having a reputation as a libertine due to his
            love affair with Finia, Yubel was far from being a foolish prince.
            He possessed enough cold-bloodedness not to be deluded by the cheers
            in front of him.
          </p>
          <p>Count Feonin smiled at Yubel’s sarcasm.</p>
          <p>
            “Both Your Highness and I know the truth, but speaking this way is
            the noble manner.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s true enough.”</p>
          <p>
            Shrugging his shoulders, Yubel left the balcony and returned to the
            drawing-room. Count Feonin followed him, continuing the
            conversation.
          </p>

          <p>
            “The Prince of Carsus appears to be preparing for a defensive
            battle, holed up in the capital, Krotin. Moreover, Count Wet and
            Baron Terzen have arrived to pledge their loyalty to Your Highness,
            so you must grant them an audience soon.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Wet and Baron Terzen were nobles who had maintained neutrality
            in this succession war. They had refrained from participating in the
            civil war, relying on their kinship with Sir Hatsbergen, an Aura
            User.
          </p>
          <p>Yubel, fully understanding the situation, clicked his tongue.</p>
          <p>“They’re all like raccoons.”</p>
          <p>
            Currently, numerous neutral nobles were flocking to pledge
            allegiance to Yubel’s side. They had been merely observing the
            battle’s progress, but now that the tide had clearly turned in favor
            of Prince Yubel’s forces, they rushed in to secure some benefits.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s just the noble way,” Count Feonin responded as if it were
            obvious.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason these neutral nobles, who had stayed silent while Carsus
            was overwhelmingly dominant, were now aligning with Yubel was
            simple.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the perspective of the neutral nobles, siding with the
            victorious Carsus offered little advantage. The nobles in Prince
            Yubel’s camp were mostly merchants, who possessed substantial
            wealth, but it was merchant wealth—dynamic assets like trading
            partnerships with other countries, trading systems, and commercial
            rights that were valuable only to those who could utilize them
            effectively. Their territories were not particularly impressive.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the powerful Fernando ducal family and the Marquess of Brozen
            on Carsus’s side, even if the neutral nobles performed notable
            deeds, they would not receive significant political rewards. And the
            lands available for distribution if Yubel’s forces were defeated
            were quite limited. Most would be allocated to the vassals of those
            two great noble families, leaving little for the neutral nobles.
            Therefore, it was better to declare neutrality and preserve the
            strength of their houses.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the other hand, supporting Yubel offered a different prospect.
            The Fernando ducal family and the Marquess of Brozen were the most
            formidable traditional powers in the kingdom, commanding vast
            territories and influence. The lands of their vassals were also
            extensive. The greatest asset, after all, was real estate! If Yubel
            emerged victorious, they could expect to be granted substantial
            tracts of land.
          </p>
          <p>
            “However, Aura Users like Sir Hatsbergen, Sir Grandiad, and Sir
            Zecklik continue to declare neutrality, Your Highness.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Count Feonin mentioned the names of three Aura Users from the
            Kingdom of Crovence who had not participated in the civil war, his
            expression tinged with regret. Suddenly, he looked at Yubel and
            suggested,
          </p>
          <p>
            “What about summoning them in the name of the king? They did not
            respond before, but now…”
          </p>
          <p>Yubel cut off his grandfather firmly, questioning,</p>
          <p>“Why should we be concerned?” Yubel retorted.</p>
          <p>Count Feonin’s mustache twitched as he realized something.</p>
          <p>“Th-that’s true,” he stammered.</p>
          <p>
            There was a time when they had fervently hoped for even one of those
            Aura Users to join their cause. Count Feonin himself, being Yubel’s
            maternal relative, had personally sought them out. Of course, he had
            returned without even meeting them. Such was the desperation for the
            presence of an Aura User at the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, the situation had changed. Aura Users abounded on their
            side. Just seeing them was enough to make one feel secure. There was
            no need to extend a hand to those who had previously acted high and
            mighty.
          </p>

          <p>
            “However, there is a possibility that Carsus might reach out to
            them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’ll be fine. All three of them are not the type to declare
            neutrality just for practical gains.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When the civil war broke out, Sir Hatsbergen and the other two Aura
            Users had secluded themselves under the pretext of illness. The
            notion of an Aura User falling ill was a joke. Naturally, it was
            understood that they had declared neutrality. However, Yubel, having
            met them at the royal palace, knew their characters well.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Unlike other nobles who declared neutrality for practical reasons,
            those gentlemen genuinely could not bring themselves to draw their
            swords for either side. As knights sworn to loyalty to both the king
            and the state, choosing me would mean betraying the state, while
            choosing Carsus would mean betraying the king.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Given their principles, it was unlikely they would now choose
            Carsus. If they were of a mind to do so, they would have already
            sided with either Yubel or Carsus.
          </p>
          <p>Count Feonin, reacting to Yubel’s calm explanation, jumped up.</p>
          <p>
            “That’s their greatest folly! How can choosing Prince Yubel be
            considered a betrayal of the state!”
          </p>
          <p>
            He acknowledged Carsus’s abilities, but Count Feonin was equally
            convinced of his grandson’s potential as a king. Wasn’t Yubel
            displaying a level-headedness and composure that wasn’t swayed by
            worldly rumors? At such a young age, there were few who could view
            reality with such calm acceptance, even when discussing matters
            about themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If only he didn’t have that quirk…” Count Feonin muttered with a
            dissatisfied expression. He was thinking of the Dwarf maiden who was
            likely still guarding Yubel from somewhere inside the drawing-room.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If only that lowly creature wasn’t around, those rumors wouldn’t
            have spread, and he would have been rightfully evaluated from the
            beginning!’
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching his grandfather’s wrinkled face filled with discontent,
            Yubel scratched his cheek.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Honestly, it’s because of Finia that I’ve managed to come this
            far…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Since childhood, Yubel had grown up as a prince. With Telion as the
            clear heir to the throne, his position as the second prince afforded
            him fewer duties but more power. There was every possibility that he
            could become a foolish prince, believing that everything in the
            world existed for him and that all the flattery directed at him was
            sincere.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was Finia who prevented this. She was a dwarf who could hear the
            voice of truth and thus could discern the sincerity and deceit of
            Yubel’s subjects. The fact that dwarves could hear the voice of
            truth was a long-forgotten tale among humans. Unaware of this,
            people would openly flatter with deceit before Finia. Each time, she
            distinguished truth from lies, identifying loyal subjects and
            sycophants. Without her, Yubel would not have been able to see
            reality so clearly.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, I don’t think I’m that incompetent either…”</p>
          <p>Yubel murmured, trailing off, and laughed inwardly.</p>
          <p>‘Still, Carsus was better, wasn’t he?’</p>
          <p>
            Thanks to Finia, Yubel had grown this far as a prince with power.
            But Carsus, without such aid, had distinguished between flatterers
            and loyalists, becoming a knight of remarkable prowess through
            diligent training, and had excelled in both strategy and
            administration through relentless effort.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘So, I actually thought Carsus would be a better fit for the
            throne…’
          </p>

          <p>
            However, Yubel knew that someone as suited for the throne as Carsus
            would never allow him to live if he became king.
          </p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t just due to a lust for power. Since Carsus himself had a
            blemish in his royal lineage, Yubel’s very existence could continue
            to taint the kingdom. As a cousin who shared his blood, Carsus,
            though saddened, would be ruthless in beheading Prince Yubel for the
            future and peace of the kingdom.
          </p>
          <p>
            No, he would surely do it. He had the true qualities of a king who
            sincerely cared for and loved his people!
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘What choice do I have? Given this fate, the only way to avoid death
            is to become king.’
          </p>
          <p>
            If Carsus was genuinely aiming for the throne out of concern for the
            future of the Crovence Kingdom, Yubel had to become king merely to
            save his own life. It was a truly regrettable situation for the
            kingdom’s people.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking out the window, Yubel muttered with a resolute expression.
          </p>
          <p>“I must become king. A king who truly cares for the people.”</p>
          <p>That would be the least repayment he could offer this country.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>**Hendrik’s Ducal Estate, backyard.**</p>
          <p>
            In the deserted, leisurely clearing, a young boy was doing push-ups.
          </p>
          <p>“Thirty-twwooo…! Thirty-thhreee…!”</p>
          <p>
            The boy with red hair, putting on a determined expression as if he
            were facing an army of a million men, was none other than Sillan,
            who had recently gained fame as the “Young Saint” among Prince
            Yubel’s army due to the latest battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite being in his mid-teens and looking more like a girl than a
            boy, he faced spears and swords without fear and performed healing
            magic without batting an eye at even the most gruesome wounds,
            leaving a deep impression on both enemies and allies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, his divine power was on a different level from other
            clergy. Thanks to Sillan, the number of soldiers and knights who had
            returned from the brink of death was enormous. Everyone revered
            Sillan as their savior, loudly praising him and the goddess
            Philanence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Sillan, indifferent to all the chatter, was focused
            solely on building his muscles under the diligent guidance of his
            personal trainer, Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“Thirty-foouuur…! Thirty-fi…fii…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan finally failed on his 35th push-up, collapsing to the ground.
            Repenhardt, who had been watching from the side, shook his head and
            extended his hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Alright, that’s enough for now. Relax your muscles, rest a bit,
            then we’ll move on to squats.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A golden aura flowed from Repenhardt’s extended hand, enveloping
            Sillan’s entire body. It was a unique technique of Gym Unbreakable,
            designed to relax all muscles and recover fatigue. Feeling somewhat
            better, Sillan staggered to his feet and spread his legs to assume a
            stance.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, squats it is.”</p>
          <p>
            Squats, a method to strengthen the lower body muscles, basically
            involved sitting down and standing up repeatedly. Even while
            trembling, Sillan’s determination to move on to the next exercise
            showed a resolve comparable to that of a top-tier warrior.
            Repenhardt quickly stopped him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hey, I said rest first, didn’t I? I’ve told you over and over that
            overworking is a no-go.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, right. Got it.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite his whole body screaming in muscle pain, Sillan kept
            clicking his tongue as if disappointed. At this point, it seemed
            like he was moving his body purely through willpower. It was almost
            pitiful to think about how he ended up in such a body.

          <p>[ Chapter 133 ]</p>
          <p>
            With a pitiful expression on his face, Repenhardt suddenly tilted
            his head toward Silan.
          </p>
          <p>“By the way, what is Siris doing over there?”</p>
          <p>
            Under a large tree in the clearing a short distance away, an elf
            girl with platinum blonde hair and brown skin was squatting. She was
            facing a translucent figure of another girl.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt pursed his lips.</p>
          <p>“Um… socializing?”</p>
          <p>Siris was fervently pleading.</p>
          <p>“I’m sorry, Sarana, okay? Please forgive me.”</p>
          <p>
            In front of her, the translucent girl, the wind spirit Sarana, had a
            pouty face and kept snorting in annoyance.
          </p>
          <p>“…Hmph hmph!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris had originally been training in spirit summoning in this
            clearing, just like Silan. Unlike the Danhaim tribe, who only
            mastered the fire spirits, she had already reached the level of
            summoning three of the seven major spirits: the wind spirit Sarana,
            the fire spirit Ignatius, and the water spirit Nymphia. This was
            largely due to her contract with the magic bow Nihillen. Of course,
            her proficiency was still not as great as the older elves who had
            spent many years in practice, so Ignatius was only the size of a
            human.
          </p>
          <p>
            After practicing by summoning Ignatius and Nymphia, she had called
            upon the wind spirit Sarana. However, it seemed that Sarana
            remembered Siris’s ‘atrocities’ from being overused recently.
            Apparently, spirits had a better memory than goldfish.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It was a life-or-death battle, so I had no choice. We’re friends,
            right? You’re going to forgive me, aren’t you?”
          </p>
          <p>“…Hmph hmph hmph!”</p>
          <p>
            Sweating profusely, she tried to soothe Sarana, but the spirit did
            not ease her expression. Eventually, Sarana faded away, disappearing
            ‘with the wind’ as the saying goes.
          </p>
          <p>“Darn…”</p>
          <p>
            Biting her thumb and frowning, Siris heard a soft voice behind her.
          </p>
          <p>“See, I told you she’d be mad?”</p>
          <p>
            After glaring at the triumphant-looking Repenhardt, Siris stood up
            and shrugged her shoulders.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, if I call her again in about two days, she’ll forget
            everything. Even though their memory is better than goldfish,
            spirits still have their limits.”
          </p>
          <p>“…Are you really friends with the spirits?”</p>
          <p>
            “Ho ho ho, true friendship is about accepting each other’s strengths
            and weaknesses.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing Siris smile sweetly, Repenhardt felt a strange chill. He
            shivered slightly.
          </p>
          <p>‘Was she always like this?’</p>
          <p>
            It seemed like her true nature was being revealed more and more as
            time passed. Ah, so her personality in her previous life was all
            just a facade!
          </p>
          <p>
            As Siris approached Repenhardt with a bright smile, her expression
            suddenly calmed down.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The prince of Carsus is no ordinary person. As a knight, a
            commander, and a leader.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s to be expected.”</p>
          <p>
            He was originally destined to be a wise king remembered in the
            history of the Crovence Kingdom.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Actually, wouldn’t it make the people of Crovence happier if Prince
            Carsus became king?”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s something we can’t know for sure.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt shook his head with a serious expression.</p>
          <p>
            “Just because someone excels at everything doesn’t mean they’d make
            a good king.”
          </p>
          <p>A king isn’t someone who can do everything.</p>
          <p>A king is someone who governs.</p>
          <p>
            It’s not about possessing extraordinary abilities, but rather about
            effectively managing those who do. That is the true mark of a great
            king.
          </p>
          <p>
            In essence, the ability to place the right people in the right
            positions is the core of rulership. Of course, being able to do
            everything oneself might imply an excellent eye for choosing
            experts, which could also make one a great king, but that’s just one
            of many factors and not the most crucial one.
          </p>
          <p>
            Simply put, as long as one avoids selecting fools or those with
            ulterior motives, they can generally be a good king. Of course,
            since this is the hardest part, good kings are rare, and that’s why
            sycophants run rampant…
          </p>
          <p>“Prince Yubel can also be a good king.”</p>
          <p>
            With Finia, the high-performance lie detector, by his side, Yubel
            can at least distinguish between loyalists and traitors just as well
            as Carsus. Moreover, he possesses the fairness to firmly reject any
            flattering words if they are lies.
          </p>
          <p>
            “There are plenty of rulers who, despite knowing better, make
            foolish decisions swayed by the praise before them. If the prince
            can avoid that, he can be an excellent king.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris nodded, seemingly understanding. But what she wanted to
            discuss wasn’t about Prince Yubel’s qualifications.
          </p>
          <p>Siris suddenly fixed a sharp gaze on him and asked,</p>
          <p>“Is it really something you don’t know?”</p>
          <p>“Hmm?”</p>
          <p>
            “You mentioned before that Prince Carsus was originally supposed to
            ascend to the throne.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a calm yet hawk-like piercing gaze, Siris continued her
            interrogation.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The future is generally unknown. But do you really not know? You?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt closed his eyes and sighed.</p>
          <p>
            “Yes, in fact, after Carsus became king, the Crovence Kingdom
            enjoyed considerable peace and prosperity.”
          </p>
          <p>And he added silently to himself,</p>
          <p>‘I was the one who shattered that era of peace, though.’</p>
          <p>
            Indeed, until the flames of war ignited by the Antares Empire
            engulfed the entire continent, the Crovence Kingdom was one of the
            most prosperous nations on the continent.
          </p>
          <p>“Then, he is the true king destined by fate.”</p>
          <p>Siris murmured in a melancholic voice.</p>
          <p>“If only someone from another time hadn’t toyed with his fate…”</p>
          <p>
            Her words pierced the corner of his heart, a feeling that had
            lingered since he joined the war. Repenhardt had chosen Prince Yubel
            for the sake of other races, but in doing so, he had mocked the
            rightful human king and the destiny of an entire nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘If only Carsus had been a tyrant, I could have proceeded without
            any qualms…’
          </p>
          <p>“Are you going to kill him?”</p>

          <p>“I originally planned to…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt trailed off. Siris was right.</p>
          <p>
            Was it not enough to mock a man’s destiny, but did he also have to
            take his life?
          </p>
          <p>For his dream, did he really have to go this far?</p>
          <p>
            Of course, he was prepared to make any sacrifice. That resolve
            hadn’t changed. But, was the sacrifice of Carsus truly necessary
            right now?
          </p>
          <p>
            “I don’t know. He is indeed too valuable a man to be killed by
            someone like me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt fell into deep thought. Siris, with a calm expression,
            closed her lips and silently watched him. It was then.
          </p>
          <p>“Mage-nim!”</p>
          <p>
            A soldier came running from the other side of the clearing.
            Repenhardt had ordered no one to approach unless it was urgent, so
            something must have happened. The entire group looked on with
            guarded expressions. However, the soldier’s face did not seem to
            indicate a grave matter. He appeared confused and surprised, but not
            frightened.
          </p>
          <p>“What is it?”</p>
          <p>The soldier, upon approaching, gave a quick bow and spoke.</p>
          <p>“There is a woman here to see you.”</p>
          <p>“Huh? Me?”</p>
          <p>“No, specifically, she came to see the young saint, but…”</p>
          <p>
            The soldier made an awkward face, scratching his cheek as he looked
            up at Repenhardt’s imposing figure.
          </p>
          <p>“Still, it seems like she came to see you…”</p>
          <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
          <p>
            Perplexed, Repenhardt headed to the reception room where the guest
            awaited. As he opened the door and entered, the woman sitting on the
            sofa stood up to greet him. She was a beauty with soft black hair
            and dark eyes. It seemed she had been informed beforehand, as she
            recognized Repenhardt and greeted him politely.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Nice to meet you, Lord Repenhardt. I am Christine, a paladin
            serving Lord Seiya.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In that moment, Repenhardt immediately understood why the soldier
            had been so ambiguous.
          </p>
          <p>‘Huh? Does Teslon have a sister?’</p>
          <p>
            Of course, her greeting indicated that this was their first meeting,
            so that couldn’t be the case. Nonetheless, the thought crossed his
            mind unavoidably.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beautiful woman before him was none other than the one who had
            ‘made eye contact’ with Repenhardt. Already troubled by his height,
            which was approaching 2 meters, Repenhardt had been anxious lately.
            Despite not practicing the so-called ‘Height Acceleration Breathing
            Technique’ learned from Gym Unbreakable, the ruthless body of Teslon
            continued to grow relentlessly.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No way, how can someone keep growing into their mid-20s like this!’
          </p>
          <p>
            These days, he couldn’t sleep well, fearing he might turn into a
            230-centimeter brute like Teslon from his past life. Yet, the
            alluring beauty before him was nearly as massive as Repenhardt
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite his surprise, Repenhardt tried to compose his expression and
            scrutinized the woman. Though she was dressed like a traveler,
            unlike a holy knight, the sword at Christine’s side was unmistakably
            the one used only by the holy knights of the main god Seiya. The
            hilt bore an engraving of clouds and thunder, confirming her
            identity.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, I see. But what brings a holy knight serving the main god Seiya
            to me?”
          </p>
          <p>Christine responded with a wry smile.</p>
          <p>
            “The person I’m looking for is the priest of Philanence, Sillan Phil
            Marcis. I understand why you might be mistaken, though.”
          </p>
          <p>“May I ask why you are looking for Sillan?”</p>

          <p>
            Christine was about to answer when Sillan, accompanied by Siris,
            entered the room.
          </p>
          <p>“Someone was looking for me….”</p>
          <p>
            Christine and Sillan’s eyes met. Instantly, Sillan turned pale and
            screamed.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah! Christine!”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Sillan!”</p>
          <p>
            Christine’s face blossomed into a radiant smile at the sight of
            Sillan. The stunning beauty’s smile seemed to brighten the entire
            room, perhaps excessively so due to her imposing size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christine opened her arms wide and approached Sillan with a voice
            full of love.
          </p>
          <p>“My love, how long will you run from destiny?”</p>
          <p>
            With a look of a rabbit trapped in a lion’s den, Sillan retreated
            frantically.
          </p>
          <p>“Why am I your love?”</p>
          <p>“Because our meeting is destiny.”</p>
          <p>“No, I mean, why is it destiny?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt and Siris exchanged bewildered glances as they watched
            the two. Sillan, who remained calm even in the face of a ghoul’s
            claws and the devil’s blade, was now sweating profusely in extreme
            fear—a sight worth paying to see.
          </p>
          <p>“Eeeek!”</p>
          <p>
            Finally, Sillan, continuing to back away, hurriedly fled the room.
            Repenhardt blocked Christine, who was about to chase after him with
            glowing eyes. He couldn’t help but ask this one question.
          </p>
          <p>“What exactly is your relationship with Sillan?”</p>
          <p>
            Sending a reproachful look at Repenhardt for blocking her, Christine
            answered clearly.
          </p>
          <p>“In the name of the great god, we are betrothed.”</p>
          <p>“What!?”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>In his quarters, Sillan was frantically packing his belongings.</p>
          <p>“I have to escape, I need to leave this place quickly.”</p>
          <p>
            His usual neat appearance was nowhere to be seen as he haphazardly
            shoved clothes and travel items into his bag. At that moment, a
            large shadow fell over him, and a voice called out from behind.
          </p>
          <p>“Hey, Sillan.”</p>
          <p>“Ahhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan screamed and tried to run, but thick fingers clamped down on
            his shoulder.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s me, Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Mr. Repen.”</p>
          <p>
            Finally, Sillan stopped struggling and turned around, his face pale.
            Repenhardt and Siris shook their heads at the sight. How out of it
            must he have been to not even recognize Repenhardt’s voice?
          </p>
          <p>“W-where is Christine? Where is she?”</p>
          <p>“She’s waiting in the reception room for now. So calm down.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt patted the bed, trying to soothe Sillan, who kept
            glancing around nervously. Taking deep breaths, Sillan slumped down
            on the edge of the bed.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on? Were you really engaged?”</p>
          <p>“Haah…”</p>
          <p>With a deep sigh, Sillan began to stammer out an explanation.</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 134 ]</p>
          <p>Christine Syl Estana.</p>
          <p>
            She hailed from an ancient family in the Kingdom of Hallein, located
            in the southern continent. From a young age, her beauty was renowned
            throughout the kingdom. Even as a ten-year-old, her captivating
            smiles made even older men blush with excitement, unable to contain
            their fluttering hearts. People often whispered that if she grew up,
            she would become a stunning beauty capable of toppling a nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, Christine grew into a magnificent beauty. The problem was
            that she grew too much.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how beautiful a woman is, men tend to be hesitant if the
            woman is taller than them. Of course, some men prefer taller women,
            but there are limits. Two meters is too tall.
          </p>
          <p>
            The numerous marriage proposals she received as a child abruptly
            stopped when she reached puberty. While noble marriages were often
            arranged, they still required the partners to be somewhat
            compatible. The only proposals she received were from disabled or
            mentally deficient suitors. The Estana family did not have enough
            power or shamelessness to push their daughter onto a proper suitor
            with such a significant flaw.
          </p>
          <p>Count Estana, Christine’s father, agonized over her situation.</p>
          <p>
            His poor daughter, if only she had been less attractive. Since she
            had been praised as a beauty from a young age, he desperately wanted
            her to find happiness as a woman. He prayed to Seiya daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then a miracle occurred. The great god Seiya delivered an oracle.
          </p>
          <p>
            “She is the daughter of the gods, living as the sword to wield
            divine power and will become the mother of a great one. On the day
            she meets the man of the sun, their fates will be intertwined.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Seiya Order accepted Christine and, following the oracle, began
            her training as a holy knight. She lived as the sword of the order
            until one day, she was dispatched to the Vasily Kingdom. The order
            had intervened to mediate a fierce territorial conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Philanence Order was already there, healing the wounded with
            their priests. It was there that Christine met her destined lover,
            Sillan Phil Marcis.
          </p>
          <p>He had hair as red as the sun.</p>
          <p>He possessed extraordinarily beautiful features.</p>
          <p>
            Sillan moved gracefully across the battlefield, tending to the
            wounded, embodying the very ideal Christine had always dreamed of.
            She fell in love at first sight. She didn’t care that he looked no
            older than twelve.
          </p>
          <p>Returning to the Seiya Order, Christine declared.</p>
          <p>
            The oracle’s fated connection had been realized. She had found the
            one destined to be the father of the great one.
          </p>
          <p>The order was thrown into an uproar.</p>
          <p>
            Unlike Christine, the members of the Seiya Order possessed a highly
            rational way of thinking. They were not perverted enough to agree
            with the bizarre notion of a woman in her mid-twenties pouncing on a
            boy twelve years her junior.
          </p>

          <p>
            Naturally, they tried to dissuade her. “You must be mistaken,” they
            said. “Surely, Seiya’s destined partner for you isn’t such a young
            child,” and so on.
          </p>
          <p>Then, Seiya’s oracle descended once again.</p>
          <p>– It’s him.</p>
          <p>
            This time, the oracle lacked any profound sanctity, to the point
            where Seiya’s priests questioned whether they had received it
            correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the fact remained that the main god Seiya had affirmed
            Christine’s claim. Eventually, the Seiya Order sent a formal
            proposal to the Philanence Order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main god Seiya stood above the other twelve gods who blessed
            humans. Consequently, the Seiya Order wielded more power than other
            orders. For the Philanence Order, it was a proposal they couldn’t
            easily refuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, there was no real reason to reject it. No matter how young
            Sillan appeared, he was already seventeen at the time. Numerically
            speaking, the age difference wasn’t significant. They couldn’t
            particularly criticize Christine’s preference. Besides, due to its
            nature, the Philanence Order was somewhat lenient towards such
            unconventional tastes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As worshippers of the goddess of love, they couldn’t endorse a
            marriage devoid of love. However, defying Seiya’s oracle was also
            out of the question, so the Philanence Order gave their consent
            under ambiguous conditions.
          </p>
          <p>– If she wins his love, we will allow it.</p>
          <p>“…And that’s when the hell began…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan let out a deep sigh. Repenhardt scratched his head
            vigorously. Truly, the world was vast and full of various
            preferences.
          </p>
          <p>“In a word, it’s a political marriage between orders?”</p>
          <p>“You could say that…”</p>
          <p>
            Once permission was granted, Christine’s courtship was beyond
            obsessive, verging on fanaticism. She never wanted to leave Sillan’s
            side, appearing unexpectedly even in his bedroom or bathroom. There
            was even a time when Sillan had a fit, seeing Christine’s eyes
            gleaming like a cat’s at the foot of his bed, watching him sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, meeting Mr. Repen was the perfect excuse to escape under the
            guise of a pilgrimage. I thought Christine might give up if I went
            on a pilgrimage.”
          </p>
          <p>Siris, who had been listening nearby, let out a chuckle.</p>
          <p>“So, Sillan wanting to become more manly was because of…”</p>
          <p>
            “Well, that was always my dream, but it became more desperate after
            meeting Christine. If I transform into an ordinary man, she might
            give up on the marriage.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan sighed heavily again, as if the ground would swallow him up.
            Neither Repenhardt nor Siris could find anything to say, their
            mouths agape. After a long silence, Repenhardt finally muttered with
            a wry smile.
          </p>

          <p>
            “But, well, love doesn’t depend on height, right? So what if the
            woman is a bit taller? From a man’s perspective, having a woman who
            loves you that much is a stroke of luck, don’t you think?”
          </p>
          <p>
            In his past life, Repenhardt had dated Siris despite being shorter
            than her. He believed that if a man and woman truly cherished and
            loved each other, a slight height difference was inconsequential.
            Although, inwardly, he did think their height difference was rather
            extreme.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s not about height. Her personality is terrifying!”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan’s aversion to Christine stemmed from more than just height
            issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            “She never listens to anyone! She only moves and speaks based on her
            own thoughts! I’ve told her countless times that I don’t want to,
            but she never listens. She’s already made plans for our family!”
          </p>
          <p>“Uh, that really is scary…”</p>
          <p>
            “Right? She’s already decided on names and future plans for kids we
            haven’t even had! She wants to name our son Stein and raise him as a
            Holy Knight of Seiya. If we have a daughter, she wants to name her
            Ellin and raise her as a priestess of Seiya. I mean, it’s one thing
            to plan a family on your own, but why would our kids serve Seiya
            when their father is a priest of Philanence?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt suddenly had a blank look on his face. With an expression
            like he’d been hit on the back of the head with a hammer, he asked
            in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            “W-what? Wait! What did you say she wanted to name your daughter?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Huh? Oh, she said she wanted to name her Ellin… Why does that
            matter right now?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt screamed internally.</p>
          <p>‘Gah! Sillan is Saint Ellin’s father?’</p>
          <p>☆ ☆ ☆</p>
          <p>Saint Ellin.</p>
          <p>
            As a priestess of the main god Seiya, she possessed unparalleled
            divine power, standing as one of the continent’s five strongest
            before the Demon King Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her incredible ability to resurrect even the dead surpassed that of
            Al Port’s High Priest, Makelin. Despite being such a powerful
            priest, Makelin ultimately met his end at Ellin’s hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            That wasn’t all. Ellin’s extraordinary ability to bestow divine
            blessings upon entire armies could turn ordinary soldiers into
            berserkers. Under her blessing, even a three-year-old child could
            decapitate a valiant knight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, although called a saint, Ellin had significant combat
            capabilities herself, unlike most priests who typically lacked
            direct combat power. The number of soldiers from the Antares Empire
            who perished because of her was nearly in the four digits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman who had tormented Repenhardt with relentless nightmares in
            his past life.
          </p>

          <p>‘That accursed woman is this guy’s daughter?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was dumbfounded, repeatedly glancing at Sillan’s profile.
            At that moment, Sillan had already packed his bags and was sprinting
            down the corridor, seemingly determined to flee from Hendrik Castle
            as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It must be a coincidence, right? It could just be the same name…’
          </p>
          <p>
            But there were things that made it hard to dismiss as mere
            coincidence. Following Sillan at a brisk pace—it was a run for
            Sillan, but just a fast walk for Repenhardt given their difference
            in leg length—Repenhardt scrutinized Sillan’s face closely.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s quite the resemblance for it to be a coincidence.’</p>
          <p>
            Saint Ellin was renowned across the continent not only for her
            divine power but also for her stunning beauty. Repenhardt could see
            traces of Ellin’s features in Sillan’s handsome face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Sillan and Ellin weren’t strikingly similar. If they
            were, Repenhardt would have recognized Sillan right away when they
            first met. However, having seen both Christine and Sillan, he could
            now see the resemblance.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            With a groan, Repenhardt mentally overlaid images of Sillan and
            Christine’s faces, simulating the traits they might pass on to a
            child. Using his mage skills, he extracted their hereditary features
            to predict their offspring’s appearance. The result was remarkably
            close to Saint Ellin’s face!
          </p>
          <p>‘Oh, this is real, isn’t it?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s expression grew serious. He didn’t call Saint Ellin an
            “accursed woman” simply because she was an object of his hatred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Sword Saint Cyrus or Fist King Teslon, Repenhardt had gathered
            substantial information about Saint Ellin. During this process, he
            also discovered the true nature of her immense divine power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to her title as a saint, Ellin’s extraordinary divine power
            wasn’t naturally acquired. She was an artificial creation, born from
            the forbidden ritual known as the Holy Grail Project, orchestrated
            by the Seiya Order.
          </p>
          <p>The Holy Grail Project.</p>
          <p>
            Men and women with the right qualities were selected. Then, a
            special divine incantation was used to create a barrier, within
            which the man and woman would unite. If their union produced a
            child, that child would become the Holy Grail, a vessel for divine
            power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forcing humans to mate like racehorses, a rather vile scheme indeed.
            However, the Holy Grail Project wasn’t called a forbidden ritual
            just because of that. Honestly, don’t the nobles still engage in
            similar practices, arranging marriages and considering lineage? If
            it were just that, Repenhardt wouldn’t have considered it cursed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real issue was that the birth of the ‘Grail’ required the life
            of the parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment of conception, it consumed the father’s life and
            essence, and at the moment of birth, it absorbed the mother’s life
            and essence to finally become a great vessel of divinity, something
            forbidden to humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like a viper tearing through its mother’s womb, Ellin gained
            her immense power at the cost of her parents’ lives. Truly, she was
            a woman like a venomous snake.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No, vipers don’t even kill their fathers, so she’s worse than a
            snake.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt could hardly gather any information about Saintess
            Ellin’s parents. Just as the Golden Knight Eusus was completely
            forgotten due to the Sword Saint Cyrus, the existence of Ellin’s
            parents was overshadowed by her immense fame. Furthermore, given the
            disgraceful nature of the matter, the Seiya Order desperately
            concealed the details of Ellin’s birth. To the public, Ellin was
            merely known as an orphan abandoned at the Seiya Order as a baby and
            raised as the daughter of the god.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scant information obtained indicated that the mother was a holy
            knight of Seiya, and the father was a powerful priest from another
            order. But that was enough to make a judgment in the current
            situation. It became clear why someone with such formidable powers
            as Sillan was unknown in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such coincidences piling up can’t be considered mere coincidences.
          </p>
          <p>Without a doubt, Sillan is Saintess Ellin’s father!</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 134 ]</p>
          <p>Christine Syl Estana.</p>
          <p>
            She hailed from an ancient family in the Kingdom of Hallein, located
            in the southern continent. From a young age, her beauty was renowned
            throughout the kingdom. Even as a ten-year-old, her captivating
            smiles made even older men blush with excitement, unable to contain
            their fluttering hearts. People often whispered that if she grew up,
            she would become a stunning beauty capable of toppling a nation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, Christine grew into a magnificent beauty. The problem was
            that she grew too much.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how beautiful a woman is, men tend to be hesitant if the
            woman is taller than them. Of course, some men prefer taller women,
            but there are limits. Two meters is too tall.
          </p>
          <p>
            The numerous marriage proposals she received as a child abruptly
            stopped when she reached puberty. While noble marriages were often
            arranged, they still required the partners to be somewhat
            compatible. The only proposals she received were from disabled or
            mentally deficient suitors. The Estana family did not have enough
            power or shamelessness to push their daughter onto a proper suitor
            with such a significant flaw.
          </p>
          <p>Count Estana, Christine’s father, agonized over her situation.</p>
          <p>
            His poor daughter, if only she had been less attractive. Since she
            had been praised as a beauty from a young age, he desperately wanted
            her to find happiness as a woman. He prayed to Seiya daily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then a miracle occurred. The great god Seiya delivered an oracle.
          </p>
          <p>
            “She is the daughter of the gods, living as the sword to wield
            divine power and will become the mother of a great one. On the day
            she meets the man of the sun, their fates will be intertwined.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Seiya Order accepted Christine and, following the oracle, began
            her training as a holy knight. She lived as the sword of the order
            until one day, she was dispatched to the Vasily Kingdom. The order
            had intervened to mediate a fierce territorial conflict.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Philanence Order was already there, healing the wounded with
            their priests. It was there that Christine met her destined lover,
            Sillan Phil Marcis.
          </p>
          <p>He had hair as red as the sun.</p>
          <p>He possessed extraordinarily beautiful features.</p>
          <p>
            Sillan moved gracefully across the battlefield, tending to the
            wounded, embodying the very ideal Christine had always dreamed of.
            She fell in love at first sight. She didn’t care that he looked no
            older than twelve.
          </p>
          <p>Returning to the Seiya Order, Christine declared.</p>
          <p>
            The oracle’s fated connection had been realized. She had found the
            one destined to be the father of the great one.
          </p>
          <p>The order was thrown into an uproar.</p>
          <p>
            Unlike Christine, the members of the Seiya Order possessed a highly
            rational way of thinking. They were not perverted enough to agree
            with the bizarre notion of a woman in her mid-twenties pouncing on a
            boy twelve years her junior.
          </p>

          <p>
            Naturally, they tried to dissuade her. “You must be mistaken,” they
            said. “Surely, Seiya’s destined partner for you isn’t such a young
            child,” and so on.
          </p>
          <p>Then, Seiya’s oracle descended once again.</p>
          <p>– It’s him.</p>
          <p>
            This time, the oracle lacked any profound sanctity, to the point
            where Seiya’s priests questioned whether they had received it
            correctly.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the fact remained that the main god Seiya had affirmed
            Christine’s claim. Eventually, the Seiya Order sent a formal
            proposal to the Philanence Order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The main god Seiya stood above the other twelve gods who blessed
            humans. Consequently, the Seiya Order wielded more power than other
            orders. For the Philanence Order, it was a proposal they couldn’t
            easily refuse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, there was no real reason to reject it. No matter how young
            Sillan appeared, he was already seventeen at the time. Numerically
            speaking, the age difference wasn’t significant. They couldn’t
            particularly criticize Christine’s preference. Besides, due to its
            nature, the Philanence Order was somewhat lenient towards such
            unconventional tastes.
          </p>
          <p>
            As worshippers of the goddess of love, they couldn’t endorse a
            marriage devoid of love. However, defying Seiya’s oracle was also
            out of the question, so the Philanence Order gave their consent
            under ambiguous conditions.
          </p>
          <p>– If she wins his love, we will allow it.</p>
          <p>“…And that’s when the hell began…”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan let out a deep sigh. Repenhardt scratched his head
            vigorously. Truly, the world was vast and full of various
            preferences.
          </p>
          <p>“In a word, it’s a political marriage between orders?”</p>
          <p>“You could say that…”</p>
          <p>
            Once permission was granted, Christine’s courtship was beyond
            obsessive, verging on fanaticism. She never wanted to leave Sillan’s
            side, appearing unexpectedly even in his bedroom or bathroom. There
            was even a time when Sillan had a fit, seeing Christine’s eyes
            gleaming like a cat’s at the foot of his bed, watching him sleep.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, meeting Mr. Repen was the perfect excuse to escape under the
            guise of a pilgrimage. I thought Christine might give up if I went
            on a pilgrimage.”
          </p>
          <p>Siris, who had been listening nearby, let out a chuckle.</p>
          <p>“So, Sillan wanting to become more manly was because of…”</p>
          <p>
            “Well, that was always my dream, but it became more desperate after
            meeting Christine. If I transform into an ordinary man, she might
            give up on the marriage.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan sighed heavily again, as if the ground would swallow him up.
            Neither Repenhardt nor Siris could find anything to say, their
            mouths agape. After a long silence, Repenhardt finally muttered with
            a wry smile.
          </p>

          <p>
            “But, well, love doesn’t depend on height, right? So what if the
            woman is a bit taller? From a man’s perspective, having a woman who
            loves you that much is a stroke of luck, don’t you think?”
          </p>
          <p>
            In his past life, Repenhardt had dated Siris despite being shorter
            than her. He believed that if a man and woman truly cherished and
            loved each other, a slight height difference was inconsequential.
            Although, inwardly, he did think their height difference was rather
            extreme.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s not about height. Her personality is terrifying!”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan’s aversion to Christine stemmed from more than just height
            issues.
          </p>
          <p>
            “She never listens to anyone! She only moves and speaks based on her
            own thoughts! I’ve told her countless times that I don’t want to,
            but she never listens. She’s already made plans for our family!”
          </p>
          <p>“Uh, that really is scary…”</p>
          <p>
            “Right? She’s already decided on names and future plans for kids we
            haven’t even had! She wants to name our son Stein and raise him as a
            Holy Knight of Seiya. If we have a daughter, she wants to name her
            Ellin and raise her as a priestess of Seiya. I mean, it’s one thing
            to plan a family on your own, but why would our kids serve Seiya
            when their father is a priest of Philanence?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt suddenly had a blank look on his face. With an expression
            like he’d been hit on the back of the head with a hammer, he asked
            in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            “W-what? Wait! What did you say she wanted to name your daughter?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Huh? Oh, she said she wanted to name her Ellin… Why does that
            matter right now?”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt screamed internally.</p>
          <p>‘Gah! Sillan is Saint Ellin’s father?’</p>
          <p>☆ ☆ ☆</p>
          <p>Saint Ellin.</p>
          <p>
            As a priestess of the main god Seiya, she possessed unparalleled
            divine power, standing as one of the continent’s five strongest
            before the Demon King Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her incredible ability to resurrect even the dead surpassed that of
            Al Port’s High Priest, Makelin. Despite being such a powerful
            priest, Makelin ultimately met his end at Ellin’s hands.
          </p>
          <p>
            That wasn’t all. Ellin’s extraordinary ability to bestow divine
            blessings upon entire armies could turn ordinary soldiers into
            berserkers. Under her blessing, even a three-year-old child could
            decapitate a valiant knight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, although called a saint, Ellin had significant combat
            capabilities herself, unlike most priests who typically lacked
            direct combat power. The number of soldiers from the Antares Empire
            who perished because of her was nearly in the four digits.
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman who had tormented Repenhardt with relentless nightmares in
            his past life.
          </p>

          <p>‘That accursed woman is this guy’s daughter?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt was dumbfounded, repeatedly glancing at Sillan’s profile.
            At that moment, Sillan had already packed his bags and was sprinting
            down the corridor, seemingly determined to flee from Hendrik Castle
            as quickly as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It must be a coincidence, right? It could just be the same name…’
          </p>
          <p>
            But there were things that made it hard to dismiss as mere
            coincidence. Following Sillan at a brisk pace—it was a run for
            Sillan, but just a fast walk for Repenhardt given their difference
            in leg length—Repenhardt scrutinized Sillan’s face closely.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s quite the resemblance for it to be a coincidence.’</p>
          <p>
            Saint Ellin was renowned across the continent not only for her
            divine power but also for her stunning beauty. Repenhardt could see
            traces of Ellin’s features in Sillan’s handsome face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Sillan and Ellin weren’t strikingly similar. If they
            were, Repenhardt would have recognized Sillan right away when they
            first met. However, having seen both Christine and Sillan, he could
            now see the resemblance.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            With a groan, Repenhardt mentally overlaid images of Sillan and
            Christine’s faces, simulating the traits they might pass on to a
            child. Using his mage skills, he extracted their hereditary features
            to predict their offspring’s appearance. The result was remarkably
            close to Saint Ellin’s face!
          </p>
          <p>‘Oh, this is real, isn’t it?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s expression grew serious. He didn’t call Saint Ellin an
            “accursed woman” simply because she was an object of his hatred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like Sword Saint Cyrus or Fist King Teslon, Repenhardt had gathered
            substantial information about Saint Ellin. During this process, he
            also discovered the true nature of her immense divine power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Contrary to her title as a saint, Ellin’s extraordinary divine power
            wasn’t naturally acquired. She was an artificial creation, born from
            the forbidden ritual known as the Holy Grail Project, orchestrated
            by the Seiya Order.
          </p>
          <p>The Holy Grail Project.</p>
          <p>
            Men and women with the right qualities were selected. Then, a
            special divine incantation was used to create a barrier, within
            which the man and woman would unite. If their union produced a
            child, that child would become the Holy Grail, a vessel for divine
            power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forcing humans to mate like racehorses, a rather vile scheme indeed.
            However, the Holy Grail Project wasn’t called a forbidden ritual
            just because of that. Honestly, don’t the nobles still engage in
            similar practices, arranging marriages and considering lineage? If
            it were just that, Repenhardt wouldn’t have considered it cursed.
          </p>
          <p>
            The real issue was that the birth of the ‘Grail’ required the life
            of the parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the moment of conception, it consumed the father’s life and
            essence, and at the moment of birth, it absorbed the mother’s life
            and essence to finally become a great vessel of divinity, something
            forbidden to humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just like a viper tearing through its mother’s womb, Ellin gained
            her immense power at the cost of her parents’ lives. Truly, she was
            a woman like a venomous snake.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘No, vipers don’t even kill their fathers, so she’s worse than a
            snake.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt could hardly gather any information about Saintess
            Ellin’s parents. Just as the Golden Knight Eusus was completely
            forgotten due to the Sword Saint Cyrus, the existence of Ellin’s
            parents was overshadowed by her immense fame. Furthermore, given the
            disgraceful nature of the matter, the Seiya Order desperately
            concealed the details of Ellin’s birth. To the public, Ellin was
            merely known as an orphan abandoned at the Seiya Order as a baby and
            raised as the daughter of the god.
          </p>
          <p>
            The scant information obtained indicated that the mother was a holy
            knight of Seiya, and the father was a powerful priest from another
            order. But that was enough to make a judgment in the current
            situation. It became clear why someone with such formidable powers
            as Sillan was unknown in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such coincidences piling up can’t be considered mere coincidences.
          </p>
          <p>Without a doubt, Sillan is Saintess Ellin’s father!</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 136 ]</p>
          <p>
            The sharp tip of the sword pointed directly at him. Repenhardt,
            flustered, looked at Christine.
          </p>
          <p>“A duel? Between you and me?”</p>
          <p>
            Among knights, it was common to challenge each other to a duel over
            love and honor. Christine’s attitude was understandable since she
            was also a knight, despite being a Holy Knight.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Repenhardt was clearly wearing a mage’s robe. Challenging a
            mage to a duel was not only unheard of but also considered
            dishonorable for a knight in this era.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet Christine seemed oblivious to her mistake. She boldly shouted,
            “If you truly love Sillan, you wouldn’t refuse this duel!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “But, a duel between a mage and a knight…,” Repenhardt stammered,
            when Sillan, smiling sweetly, offered her encouragement.
          </p>
          <p>“Mr. Repen! I believe in you! Show them the power of our love!”</p>
          <p>
            And with that, he quickly ran behind Siris. Repenhardt looked back,
            frowning deeply.
          </p>
          <p>‘You want me to duel that woman?’</p>
          <p>‘You’ll win anyway, right? Please save me!’</p>
          <p>
            The two exchanged these complex thoughts with just their eyes. It
            was truly a case of perfect mutual understanding. Siris, observing
            this, muttered to herself, “These two, they might actually be
            dating…”
          </p>
          <p>‘No! Siris! Don’t get any strange ideas! Dating my foot!’</p>
          <p>‘…?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, flustered, tried to signal Siris as well, but she just
            tilted her head in confusion, unable to understand. While Sillan
            understood perfectly, Siris did not. Feeling the futility of his
            life, Repenhardt sighed.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>
            Christine adjusted her grip on her sword and took a stance,
            shouting, “As a Holy Knight of Seiya, I will allow you the first
            strike! Mage, prepare for the duel!”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, there’s no way around it now,” Repenhardt grumbled, raising
            his hands and glaring at Christine. Regardless, the goal remained to
            separate Sillan from this woman. Whether it was a duel or not, as
            long as he achieved his objective, it didn’t matter.
          </p>
          <p>‘Since it’s come to this…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt began forming intricate hand seals with both hands.
            Fortunately, Christine was giving him the first strike, so he
            decided to unleash a grand spell and end it quickly!
          </p>
          <p>
            “La Dant Bas Pillaren, O thunder, come to my hand and become a storm
            that engulfs the sky and annihilates my enemy…”
          </p>

          <p>
            Combining runes and magical words, Repenhardt chanted the spell,
            leaving intricate gestures in the air. Along the way, he rubbed his
            hands together, generating static electricity to activate the
            catalyst. As the spell activated, powerful magic began to surge
            through Repenhardt’s massive body. Christine’s expression hardened
            slightly.
          </p>
          <p>‘He’s a higher-level mage than I thought!’</p>
          <p>
            It was common knowledge that you should never give a mage time to
            chant a spell during a duel. However, she had unwittingly given him
            the same courtesy as she would in a regular duel. But it was too
            late to backtrack now; Christine’s pale eyes reflected Repenhardt,
            who had completed the spell and now held massive bolts of lightning
            in his hands.
          </p>
          <p>‘Sorry, but let’s finish this quickly!’</p>
          <p>With a triumphant smile, Repenhardt activated his spell.</p>
          <p>“Lightning Storm!”</p>
          <p>Rumble! Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The lightning swirled and turned into a storm, sweeping across
            Christine from all directions. Lightning Storm was a spell that sent
            dozens of lightning bolts crashing down over a wide area like a
            storm. Its power wasn’t particularly high, but it was nearly
            impossible to dodge.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Well, I’ve significantly reduced its power so she’ll just be
            knocked out.’
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as Repenhardt, confident of his victory, was about to see the
            lightning strike Christine, she suddenly raised her sword and
            shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Seiya, let your sword shine!”</p>
          <p>Buzzzzz!</p>
          <p>
            A deafening roar ripped through the air as her sword began to glow
            brilliantly white. With the radiant sword in hand, Christine swung
            it in a dazzling display. The sword’s light slashed through the air,
            cutting each of the dozens of lightning bolts in half.
          </p>
          <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
          <p>
            Soldiers covered their ears against the repeated explosions and
            whispered in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh? Another Aura User?”</p>
          <p>“No! It’s different. That’s…”</p>
          <p>“Right! It’s the Holy Sword used by Seiya’s Holy Knights!”</p>
          <p>
            Just as the golden knight Eusus, empowered by an artifact, wielded
            power comparable to an Aura User, the Seiya Order had researched
            ways to achieve similar effects through divine power. The result was
            the brilliant white blade, the Holy Sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            At a glance, it appeared similar to an Aura User’s Blade Aura, but
            the soldiers, surprisingly, could immediately tell the difference.
            Having seen so many Aura Users lately, even the ordinary soldiers
            had developed this level of discernment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Though not as powerful as Blade Aura, the Holy Sword, imbued with
            concentrated divine power, could easily dispel a weakened Lightning
            Storm. Of course, Repenhardt hadn’t cast his spell unaware of the
            Holy Sword’s existence.
          </p>

          <p>‘What? A Holy Sword? Was she a genuine Holy Knight after all?’</p>
          <p>
            Among the Holy Knights of Seiya, only one in ten could wield a Holy
            Sword. Naturally, Repenhardt hadn’t thought for a moment that this
            crazy woman was a genuine Holy Knight. But, despite her erratic
            demeanor, Christine’s skills as a Holy Knight were impeccable.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s my turn, you vile fiend!” Christine charged, swinging her
            sword with the force of a tempest. Repenhardt quickly prepared his
            next spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Shield of Protection, Power Shield! Step of the Wind, Wind Step!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt blocked the Holy Sword with a magical barrier and
            simultaneously used the Wind Step spell to swiftly retreat. The Holy
            Sword, slowed by the magic shield, missed him and sliced through
            empty air. In that brief moment, Repenhardt cast another spell.
          </p>
          <p>“Aero Bullet!”</p>
          <p>
            Over thirty wind bullets materialized in the air and poured down on
            Christine. This was Aero Bullet, a 1st-circle wind spell. There was
            a time when just chanting this one spell took Repenhardt ages, but
            now he could cast it instantly and in large numbers.
          </p>
          <p>“Urgh!”</p>
          <p>
            Christine gritted her teeth and shielded her body with her arms. The
            wind bullets pounded her relentlessly. Despite the attack, Christine
            emerged with only her hair slightly disheveled and no other signs of
            injury.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Hmph! Do you think a Holy Knight of Seiya would succumb to such an
            attack?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, Aero Bullet, being a 1st-circle spell, lacked significant
            power. Even thirty of them had little effect. Sillan, watching from
            behind, shouted in frustration.
          </p>
          <p>“Why have you only been using magic since earlier?”</p>
          <p>
            The Seiya Order had worked hard to develop the Holy Sword to counter
            Aura Users, but the results were not very satisfactory. While it
            looked similar on the surface, the Holy Sword was vastly inferior to
            a true Blade Aura in terms of power and effectiveness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, known as the Fist King, ranked among the top Aura Users.
            This was why Sillan had felt confident in pushing him to duel. But
            seeing him fight only as a mage without using his Aura abilities was
            driving her crazy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt replied with a wry smile. “What’s wrong with a mage using
            magic?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had no intention of revealing his Aura User identity now.
            Partly, this was to avoid standing out too much, but he was also
            genuinely enjoying fighting as a mage. The many humiliations he had
            endured due to his lack of mana and computational power were finally
            behind him. Now that he could fight as a mage again, he found it
            exciting.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, for crying out loud! My life is on the line here!”</p>
          <p>
            ‘Jeez, being disregarded to this extent is starting to really piss
            me off.’
          </p>
          <p>
            He may have ended up as a brawler in this odd body, but he was once
            a 10th-circle Archmage who had reached the pinnacle of magic. He had
            pride as the greatest and strongest mage in human history, and yet
            here he was, being looked at with such distrust.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt pouted. “Hey, it’s not like I didn’t know this wouldn’t
            work! Just trust me a bit!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The reason he had created and fired thirty wind bullets wasn’t to
            defeat his opponent.
          </p>

          <p>
            No matter how crazy his opponent was, killing her would have left
            him feeling uneasy. He needed to gauge the appropriate level of
            magical force to use. By hitting Christine with the wind bullets, he
            was assessing her strength and endurance through the recoil. It was
            akin to a doctor examining a patient with a diagnostic touch, but he
            was doing it with magic. If other mages knew this, they would have
            been astonished.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘How could they not understand the high-level application of magic
            here?’
          </p>
          <p>Grumbling inwardly, Repenhardt continued chanting.</p>
          <p>
            “The veil of darkness blinds the eyes, Darkness Veil! All things
            slip! Grease! Flowing ice casts the shadow of death! Prison Shadow!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Creating distance, Repenhardt immediately cast spells to blind
            Christine and make the ground beneath her slippery, blocking her
            steps. He was thoroughly versed in techniques to deal with warriors
            from his previous life. All the spells connected seamlessly, halting
            Christine’s movements, and soon, shadows infused with cold energy
            ran across the ground and bound her ankles.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Christine, alarmed, struggled as her ankles froze and her feet were
            immobilized. With his opponent trapped, Repenhardt leisurely
            muttered,
          </p>
          <p>
            “It will take at least 30 seconds for you to break free from the ice
            around your ankles with your strength. Let’s end this duel.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Aiming his fingers at the immobilized Christine, Repenhardt began
            chanting. Christine, frowning deeply, suddenly muttered,
          </p>
          <p>“No choice, I must use the power granted by Seiya!”</p>
          <p>
            Then, she began to take a deep breath. At that moment, Repenhardt
            was startled and stopped his chant.
          </p>
          <p>‘Is that…?’</p>
          <p>
            For a mage of his caliber to pause mid-chant, he had to be very
            shocked. Christine, after changing her breathing, suddenly opened
            her eyes wide and tensed her legs.
          </p>
          <p>“Haaaah!”</p>
          <p>Crack!</p>
          <p>
            The ice encasing Christine’s ankles shattered and scattered into
            fragments. Breaking free from the frozen hold with sheer strength?
            No matter how imposing Christine’s physique was, it seemed
            impossible. Such power was beyond that of an ordinary human. It felt
            almost like…
          </p>
          <p>
            “Huh? Is Christine an Aura User?” Sillan muttered in disbelief.
            However, for an Aura User, the light on her blade remained pure
            white. Raising her sword, Christine proudly addressed Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I have not been blessed with the enlightenment of Aura. However,
            Seiya has favored me, granting me a body that rivals theirs!
            Hohohoho!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching her laugh heartily, Repenhardt hurriedly asked, “Hey, you!
            Who taught you that breathing technique?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt wasn’t shocked merely by Christine’s sudden display of
            strength. It was her breathing technique that struck him, something
            so familiar that it left him stunned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christine tilted her head, then answered calmly, “It was when I was
            a young girl, before I served Seiya. An old man found me and taught
            me this breathing technique, claiming it would make me healthier. I
            didn’t understand it back then, but now I know. He was sent by Seiya
            to mold me into His sword. Thanks to this breathing technique, I
            have become an exceptionally sharp blade among Seiya’s Holy
            Knights!”
          </p>
          <p>
            With unwavering faith in Seiya, Christine’s expression was dreamy,
            reflecting her gratitude for His boundless grace.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Repenhardt cursed inwardly. ‘Damn it! Master, what the
            hell have you done?’
          </p>
          <p>
            He recognized it instantly. The breathing technique Christine had
            used was Gym Unbreakable’s unique physical growth breathing method,
            essentially a technique to grow taller.
          </p>
          <p>
            This technique, while primarily promoting physical growth, was
            originally designed to enhance the body’s strength. With proper
            application, it could temporarily boost one’s physical power, as
            Christine had demonstrated. Reaching such a level indicated she had
            been practicing this breathing technique diligently for nearly a
            decade.
          </p>
          <p>‘No wonder she grew so ridiculously big!’</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 137 ]</p>
          <p>
            She managed to master the breathing technique that even he
            couldn’t―since Repenhardt had deliberately avoided using this
            breathing technique―and watching Christine, he couldn’t help but
            sigh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Gerard took in the young Teslon, he had traveled across the
            continent looking for a successor to Gym Unbreakable. During that
            time, it seemed he had also encountered a young Christine. Although
            she wasn’t suitable enough to inherit Gym Unbreakable, it seemed he
            couldn’t help but want to pass on at least something to her out of
            regret.
          </p>
          <p>‘She definitely has enough talent to make Master regret it.’</p>
          <p>
            To begin with, just being able to utilize that breathing technique
            was a sign of immense talent. That technique wasn’t something anyone
            could learn and see results from. If it had worked for everyone, Gym
            Unbreakable would have made a fortune from it. After all, how many
            short men in the world wish they were taller?
          </p>
          <p>‘Oh, Master…’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue. Gerard, believing bigger was always
            better, had taught her the breathing technique out of goodwill, but
            the result was…
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Blocking a young maiden’s bright future marriage prospects, even
            good intentions have their limits!’
          </p>
          <p>
            With a guilty heart, Repenhardt looked at Christine. She still had
            no idea that her height might be related to the breathing technique.
            Repenhardt swallowed hard.
          </p>
          <p>‘If she finds out about this, I’m in big trouble.’</p>
          <p>
            The actions that had driven Sillan to the brink of despair might now
            come back to haunt Repenhardt. And this time, instead of a loving
            gaze, it might be a blade dipped in poison!
          </p>
          <p>
            “But… is this a problem right now?” Christine asked, suddenly
            looking puzzled. Repenhardt quickly waved his hand and let out a
            hearty laugh.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No! It’s no problem at all! It’s completely irrelevant! Hahaha!”
          </p>
          <p>“Then let’s continue the duel!”</p>
          <p>“Yes, let’s! Quickly, to the duel!”</p>
          <p>
            Christine, Sillan, and Siris all tilted their heads at Repenhardt’s
            sudden eagerness for the duel. Desperate to change the subject,
            Repenhardt immediately cast a spell.
          </p>
          <p>“Wing Cutter!”</p>
          <p>Christine also lunged forward with a shout.</p>
          <p>“Haah!”</p>
          <p>
            Utilizing her enhanced physique, Christine launched a fierce attack.
            Repenhardt calmly countered with his magic each time. Flames
            flickered and lightning flashed as the two clashed intensely.
          </p>
          <p>
            As expected, the situation was overwhelmingly in Repenhardt’s
            favor.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, he was once a Demon King. Even if he wielded magic of the
            6th circle or lower, his level of execution was that of a grand mage
            of the 10th circle. No matter how exceptional Christine’s physical
            abilities, comparable to those of an Aura User, she couldn’t even
            touch Repenhardt’s sleeve. Besides, her abilities were only
            comparable in terms of brute strength; her agility, dynamic vision,
            reflexes, speed, and insight were significantly inferior to those of
            an Aura User, making the fight easy for him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite this, Christine managed to face off against Repenhardt. This
            was because, feeling guilty, Repenhardt focused solely on defense,
            unable to bring himself to launch a serious counterattack.
          </p>
          <p>
            Watching Repenhardt repeatedly block her sword strikes with magical
            barriers, Christine suddenly yelled out in frustration.
          </p>
          <p>“Ahhh! Why won’t you lose?”</p>
          <p>“Do you mean to say that your opponent must lose in a duel?”</p>
          <p>
            “You talk like a typical mage! Did you use those sweet words to
            seduce that naive Sillan?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt couldn’t understand why his perfectly reasonable response
            was considered smooth talk. He muttered in a weary voice.
          </p>
          <p>“I didn’t say much of anything…”</p>
          <p>
            All he had done was show Sillan his impressive back. Well, if you
            think about it, that could be considered a form of seduction.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh! I’ll show you the power of my love!”</p>
          <p>
            Christine, gritting her teeth, attempted a series of downward
            slashes. Repenhardt, continuously retreating with the Wind Step
            spell to evade her attacks, slumped his shoulders.
          </p>
          <p>“And what is this power of love?”</p>

          <p>“You’re pitiful for not understanding the power of love!”</p>
          <p>“…Let’s just continue the duel.”</p>
          <p>
            Eventually, Repenhardt’s energy bolt struck Christine’s abdomen
            precisely, ending the duel. He had carefully adjusted the power of
            his energy bolt to paralyze her body without causing permanent harm.
            As her sword fell and she collapsed, Christine lifted her head with
            effort.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh! I… I’ve lost.”</p>
          <p>
            Despite living in her own world, she wasn’t so delusional as to deny
            a clearly decided outcome. After all, she was still a knight.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt scratched his cheek and hesitantly asked,</p>
          <p>“Well, since I won the duel, will you now give up on Sillan?”</p>
          <p>
            Christine’s face crumpled as if her world had collapsed. She
            probably wouldn’t be this devastated even if she were excommunicated
            from the Seiya Order.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt averted his gaze. Honestly, he felt a pang of guilt,
            knowing his influence had greatly contributed to Christine’s current
            state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Turning his head, he saw Sillan in the distance, looking as if his
            collapsed world had been restored. Seeing his expression, his guilty
            conscience began to heal significantly.
          </p>
          <p>“Alright, I suppose I have no choice but to step back for now…”</p>
          <p>Christine gazed at Sillan with a despondent look.</p>
          <p>
            “Sillan, I don’t have the strength to rescue you from that villain
            right now.”
          </p>
          <p>“Have I even confined him?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scoffed incredulously, but of course, Christine didn’t
            listen. She trembled as if overwhelmed with pity.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, just thinking about your delicate body being crushed by such a
            ruthless man… sniff sniff!”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt and Sillan, horrified, shouted in unison.</p>
          <p>“Hey! Stop saying weird stuff!”</p>
          <p>
            “Yeah! That’s not happening! Mr. Repen and I share a spiritual love!
            Isn’t that right, Mr. Repen?”
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t want to share anything with you…”</p>
          <p>“Are you going to ruin it at the end? Just go along with it!”</p>
          <p>“Y-yes, our delicate Sillan… sniff.”</p>
          <p>“Stop crying and smile! Come on, smile!”</p>
          <p>“…”</p>
          <p>
            But by then, the soldiers were already giving Sillan sympathetic
            looks, as if they believed Christine’s words. The situation seemed
            impossible to resolve.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I will definitely come back! And I will save you, Sillan! Sniff
            sniff!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Christine turned away, tears streaming down her face, and ran out of
            the mansion. Her retreating figure looked like that of a heartbroken
            maiden who had been betrayed in love. Of course, the perspective was
            severely skewed, which was a problem.
          </p>
          <p>Whoosh…</p>
          <p>A breeze blew.</p>
          <p>Just as abruptly as she had appeared, Christine vanished.</p>
          <p>Repenhardt looked at Sillan and asked in a drained voice,</p>
          <p>“What… how are you going to handle this?”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan replied cheerfully, feeling as if he had ascended to heaven
            simply because Christine had left.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, we’ll figure something out, won’t we?”</p>

          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>They figured nothing out.</p>
          <p>
            The world was far from lenient enough for Sillan’s hopes to
            materialize.
          </p>
          <p>“Ho, so that’s what happened?”</p>
          <p>“Lord Repenhardt and the young saint…”</p>
          <p>“It’s a bit problematic, but don’t they make quite the pair!”</p>
          <p>“They sure have a sense of romance, haha.”</p>
          <p>
            The nobles of Prince Yubel’s faction discussed this sudden ‘scandal’
            at every opportunity. The soldiers were no different. Already on
            edge from the war, they sought distraction in frivolous gossip. And
            now, with such an entertaining story at hand, they reveled in it,
            whispering excitedly among themselves.
          </p>
          <p>Moreover, the incident had an unexpectedly positive effect.</p>
          <p>“Oh, so the savior has such tastes!”</p>
          <p>
            “That’s what I heard, Sir Kadamyte. Could it have been that way from
            the beginning?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, now that you mention it, I think there were signs even when
            we were in the city.”
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, indeed.”</p>
          <p>
            In one corner of Count Hendrik’s mansion, a human noble and a dwarf
            aura user were having a friendly conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not all nobles looked down on other races. Some had changed their
            minds after witnessing the remarkable prowess shown by them. While
            the prejudice against other races hadn’t completely disappeared,
            they at least recognized that these allied warriors differed from
            the common perception.
          </p>
          <p>
            These nobles sought to build friendships with dwarves, orcs, and
            elves. The non-human races, too, understood Repenhardt’s point that
            they needed to get along with Prince Yubel’s army, even if it meant
            mingling with humans.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, due to their different races and historically hostile
            relations, they found it difficult to find topics of conversation.
            Some common ground was needed to start discussions and build
            rapport, but creating such opportunities wasn’t easy.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, a common topic emerged!</p>
          <p>
            It was deeply relevant to both sides and, moreover, stories of love
            have always intrigued people, regardless of race or era. Throughout
            the mansion, orcs, elves, and dwarves were found chatting with human
            nobles and soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>“Do humans love other men?”</p>
          <p>
            “Usually not, but knights often take in boys known as ‘midong’.”
          </p>
          <p>“What is a ‘midong’?”</p>
          <p>“A boy as pretty as a girl.”</p>
          <p>“I don’t understand.”</p>
          <p>“A boy like the young saint.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Jalkato understands now.”</p>
          <p>“It seems your name is Jalkato. An orc warrior. I am Hans.”</p>
          <p>“I am Jalkato, you are Hans. Understood.”</p>
          <p>“Hahaha! Anyway, let’s get along from now on!”</p>
          <p>
            Those who started talking naturally introduced themselves and began
            asking and answering questions about each other. Once the
            conversation started, the invisible wall between humans and other
            races significantly lowered. At least among those in Prince Yubel’s
            army, there was now a growing sense of camaraderie with these
            non-human warriors.
          </p>
          <p>
            “…So, you could say we’ve taken a step closer to fulfilling Lord
            Repenhardt’s dream. Don’t you agree? So why don’t you come out of
            your room now?”
          </p>
          <p>
            In a square stone chamber assigned as a dormitory, Siris looked at a
            corner of the room with a bitter smile. Beside her, Russ, Tilla, and
            Tassid stood with their arms crossed, wearing similar expressions.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the corner of the room, Repenhardt was crouched down, staring at
            the wall and sighing continuously, rejecting the world.
          </p>
          <p>“Sigh…”</p>

          <p>
            In the opposite corner of the room, there was also a small
            red-haired boy sighing in the same pose.
          </p>
          <p>“Ughhh…”</p>
          <p>
            The joy of overcoming the immediate crisis was short-lived, and
            Sillan realized what a disastrous thing he had done. It was to the
            point where he couldn’t show his face in public. As he sighed
            deeply, Repenhardt glared fiercely at him and muttered.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s all your fault!”</p>
          <p>
            “Ah, what’s the point of blaming me now? It’s not going to change
            anything!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sillan glared back. Their sharp gazes crossed in the air. And then,
            another sigh erupted.
          </p>
          <p>“Haaah…”</p>
          <p>“Hooo…”</p>
          <p>
            This had been the ongoing behavior between Repenhardt and Sillan for
            the past few days. At first, Siris had let it slide, but she was
            starting to worry and came to calm them down.
          </p>
          <p>Siris approached Repenhardt and spoke in a gentle voice.</p>
          <p>“Um, Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            At the soft voice of his beloved, Repenhardt weakly raised his head.
            Siris, holding back a laugh, continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What are you worried about? Isn’t it because Sillan is so pretty
            that such rumors spread like wildfire in the first place?”
          </p>
          <p>Russ, also trying to console Sillan, said.</p>
          <p>
            “And Sillan, isn’t that why you exercise every day because you hate
            it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, both squatting individuals’ eyes lit up
            simultaneously.
          </p>
          <p>“That’s right!”</p>
          <p>“That’s right!”</p>
          <p>
            Come to think of it, now wasn’t the time to be holed up in a corner
            of the room. The ridiculous rumors were gaining credibility because
            they looked so good together. So, they just had to break that
            impression!
          </p>
          <p>How?</p>
          <p>
            Wasn’t it simple? Sillan just had to become more manly and robust
            than anyone else!
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt sprang to his feet.</p>
          <p>“Let’s go, Sillan!”</p>
          <p>Sillan also jumped up.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Mr. Repen!”</p>
          <p>Clenching his fists tightly, Repenhardt declared firmly.</p>
          <p>
            “From now on, it’s special training! I’ll make you a strong man!
            Believe it! Your body can become steel!”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s what I wanted! Repen!”</p>
          <p>
            Sillan’s eyes were also burning with the flames of determination.
            With resolute determination, the two of them dashed out of the room,
            immediately heading to the backyard for intense muscle training.
          </p>
          <p>Watching their backs, Tassid muttered absentmindedly.</p>
          <p>“They seem to get along well.”</p>
          <p>“The rumors will spread even more.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed.”</p>
          <p>Tilla and Siris responded with a wry smile.</p>
          <p>“Well, rumors are fleeting anyway…”</p>
          <p>
            Russ shrugged his shoulders. Though the two involved didn’t realize
            it, Russ knew well how short-lived rumors could be. They might be
            causing a commotion now, but in a few days, it would all die down.
          </p>
          <p>With a gentle smile, Russ said.</p>
          <p>“Somehow, it will work out.”</p>
          <p>Russ had become quite influenced by Sillan by now.</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 138 ]</p>
          <p>
            After the devastating defeat at the Battle of Redant, Carsus began
            preparing for a defensive battle with a force of three thousand
            remnants and two thousand royal guard soldiers. Declaring martial
            law throughout the capital, he reorganized his troops and reinforced
            the city’s defenses. Despite his defeat, he coolly restructured his
            forces, readying for the next battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the situation was dire. The nobles, who had previously
            declared neutrality, had now rallied their forces, bringing Prince
            Yubel’s army to nearly ten thousand. While Carsus’s popularity kept
            the soldiers’ morale relatively stable, the public sentiment was
            different. The citizens of the capital were already whispering that
            Prince Yubel would be the next king.
          </p>
          <p>
            Three days after the Battle of Redant, Yubel’s army of ten thousand
            marched majestically towards the capital. Crovence, the capital
            city, was a triply fortified city. The outermost wall encircled the
            entire city, the outer wall enclosed the royal castle, and the
            innermost wall protected the royal palace at the center. Yubel’s
            army, camped to the south of the capital, had their loudest soldiers
            shout out.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The traitor Carsus has paid for his crimes by the will of the
            heavens! Now, kneel before the true king and open the gates!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The magically amplified shout echoed across the entire wall. Soon, a
            knight appeared atop the wall and shouted back.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Nonsense! What will of the heavens do these monsters speak of?
            Prince Yubel has allied with the devil! This is an indelible stain
            on the long history of the Kingdom of Crovence! Prince Yubel must
            disband his forces immediately and atone for disgracing the royal
            family!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Magically amplified curses were exchanged. Watching this from the
            main camp, Repenhardt chuckled.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Anyway, they sure do talk a lot even though they’ll end up
            fighting.”
          </p>
          <p>
            But he had no intention of stopping them. One reason he had been
            called the Demon King in his previous life was his tendency to
            respond to such shouts with immediate magical attacks, thinking it
            was more efficient to skip unnecessary formalities and get straight
            to the point. To his opponents, this made him seem like an
            incomprehensible monster.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I can’t repeat the same mistake. Given that I have to break every
            rule as it is, I need to fight as conventionally as possible
            wherever I can.”
          </p>
          <p>
            At last, Prince Yubel, clad in resplendent armor, stepped forward
            and raised his hand. With a powerful shout, he declared the start of
            the battle.
          </p>
          <p>“Warriors! Show your bravery for the true king!”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>“Ooooooo!”</p>
          <p>
            With a roar, infantry armed with ladders and grappling-hooked ropes
            charged towards the walls with great vigor. The sound of drums
            echoed from Carsus’s side as commanders issued their orders.
          </p>
          <p>“Hold your positions! Archers! Begin volley fire!”</p>
          <p>
            As the infantry entered range, the archers simultaneously drew their
            bows. Countless arrows rained down, transforming into a deadly
            shower over the soldiers’ heads. A veteran leading the infantry
            shouted out.
          </p>
          <p>“Everyone! Raise your shields!”</p>
          <p>
            Arrows thudded into the shields. Here and there, soldiers who failed
            to block in time were struck, screaming and collapsing to the
            ground. On Prince Yubel’s side, their archers responded in kind. A
            hail of arrows flew towards the walls, dominating the heads of
            Carsus’s soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>“Arrows incoming!”</p>
          <p>“Take cover behind the walls!”</p>
          <p>“Rear units! Shield your comrades!”</p>

          <p>
            During the brief respite caused by the arrow barrage, the infantry
            managed to reach the base of the walls. They hurriedly set up
            ladders and threw their grappling hooks.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the training of Carsus’s troops was evident. Despite the
            ongoing hail of arrows, they used U-shaped poles to push away the
            ladders and cut the ropes with their spears and swords, diligently
            defending their position. They were determined not to give up the
            walls easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nevertheless, Prince Yubel’s expression remained unchanged. After
            all, the infantry assault was merely a decoy; the real force was yet
            to come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Prince Yubel gestured again. A blue flag shot up, signaling the
            command.
          </p>
          <p>“I leave it to you! Everyone!”</p>
          <p>
            The prince’s polite tone was unusual, but none questioned it. Those
            who were about to enter the fray deserved such respect.
          </p>
          <p>“Hahaha! Let’s go, darling!”</p>
          <p>
            With a hearty shout, a massive orc mounted on a direwolf drew his
            greatsword and charged into battle. A green blade aura pierced the
            air, shining brightly. Stalla, equally exuberant, spurred her
            direwolf forward and shouted back.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m already on my way, husband!”</p>
          <p>
            Three dwarf Aura Users, each emitting a brilliant light, also
            charged forward. Mounted on captured fine horses, their short bodies
            rode boldly into battle.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh, this is making me sick, Malroid.”</p>
          <p>“Do we have to keep riding this thing?”</p>
          <p>“They say it looks cooler on horseback. Just hang in there!”</p>
          <p>
            Though their conversation didn’t sound particularly brave, the sight
            of them brandishing their blade auras was impressive enough. Their
            riding skills might have been clumsy, but the balance of an Aura
            User far surpassed that of an ordinary person. Despite it being
            their first time on horseback, they managed to head towards the
            walls without falling.
          </p>
          <p>“You’re all riding just fine, so why the complaints? Hahaha!”</p>
          <p>
            Russ, exuding a blue aura like mist, spurred his horse forward. He
            was dressed in full plate armor, presenting the perfect image of a
            knight. With the momentum of a general descended from the heavens,
            Russ charged towards the southern gate.
          </p>
          <p>“Aura Users!”</p>
          <p>“Cyrus! Cyrus!”</p>
          <p>“Oooh!”</p>
          <p>
            With a roar, six dazzling lights crossed the battlefield. Russ and
            the other Aura Users of different races simultaneously began their
            charge towards the walls.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn! They’re coming like that!”</p>
          <p>
            Carsus, who was commanding from the ramparts, frowned. As expected,
            Prince Yubel’s forces had brought out their Aura Users. Having done
            the same himself, he could predict the enemy’s tactics.
          </p>
          <p>
            The problem was knowing and being able to counter them were two
            different things. Gritting his teeth, Carsus shouted.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Shoot them! A hundred gold coins to anyone who hits those devils!”
          </p>
          <p>
            A hail of arrows rained down towards the six lights. Kalken burst
            into laughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Feathers on a twig don’t turn it into an eagle’s talon!
            Ridiculous!”
          </p>
          <p>
            His two-meter-long greatsword drew a massive circle of light above
            his head.
          </p>
          <p>Wooong!</p>
          <p>
            A green aura shot up into the sky, deflecting all the incoming
            arrows. Splintered arrow fragments scattered like an exploding
            volcano. The other Aura Users faced similar situations. Arrows alone
            could not stop their advance.
          </p>
          <p>“Throw the spears!”</p>
          <p>
            One of the commanders shouted, trembling. Spears, unlike arrows,
            could pierce the thick armor of knights, making them useful in siege
            defense. But once again, they were of no use.
          </p>
          <p>“Do you think thicker arrows make a difference? Hahaha!”</p>
          <p>
            Sloytle raised his hammer high, spreading his aura wide. The
            resulting whirlwind of light formed a massive shield, deflecting all
            the spears. To them, arrows and spears were no different. If
            anything, the larger spears were easier to block.
          </p>
          <p>
            Russ, having breached the battlefield, looked at the thick castle
            gate and let out a cry.
          </p>
          <p>“Taaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Riding his horse, Russ raised his longsword high. The blue blade
            aura grew larger and more concentrated.
          </p>
          <p>“That, that’s!”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing the aura, now almost a ten-meter pillar of light, Carsus
            stood up in shock.
          </p>
          <p>“Isn’t that the Gigantic Blade of Lord Spirius!”</p>
          <p>
            The technique Russ was displaying was the ultimate move of Spirius,
            transforming all the aura in one’s body into pure destructive power.
            Lord Spirius, who was guarding Carsus, gnashed his teeth in
            frustration.
          </p>
          <p>“That bastard! He’s using someone else’s technique!”</p>
          <p>
            Lord Spirius’s face twisted in endless frustration. It had taken him
            over two years to master that technique, a proud skill developed
            through countless failures. And this guy had copied it after seeing
            it just once?
          </p>
          <p>“What kind of person does that?”</p>
          <p>“Haah!”</p>
          <p>
            With a thunderous shout, Russ swung his sword down. The pillar of
            light pierced the air and struck the castle gate.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>

          <p>
            A deafening explosion shook the entire wall. The thick, magically
            reinforced gate shattered with a single blow, sending fragments
            flying. Each fragment was larger than a typical table. The debris
            smashed into buildings and walls, causing a catastrophic scene.
          </p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Soldiers caught in the explosion screamed in pain. Russ swung the
            pillar of aura horizontally this time. The beam of light swept
            through palisades and soldiers, tearing up the earth. Dust rose,
            mingling with the cries of the wounded and the dying. Seeing Russ
            create a massive crater nearly 20 meters wide with a single strike,
            the soldiers began to flee, throwing down their weapons.
          </p>
          <p>“Run!”</p>
          <p>“We’ll die here if we stay!”</p>
          <p>“This is a senseless death!”</p>
          <p>
            Kalken, who had reached the base of the wall, smiled at Russ’s
            display of power.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, Karuga Russ! That was quite a blow! Now, it’s my turn…”</p>
          <p>Kalken tugged on his direwolf’s reins.</p>
          <p>Awooo!</p>
          <p>
            His mount, Blue Lightning, howled and leaped towards the wall.
            Reaching halfway up the wall in a single bound, Kalken plunged his
            greatsword into the wall.
          </p>
          <p>“Too high, isn’t it? Step on this!”</p>
          <p>
            The greatsword sank into the wall as if it were made of cheese. The
            direwolf used the sword as a step and jumped again. As they soared
            through the air, Kalken pointed his finger, and the sword pulled
            itself free, flying back to his hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The massive wolf and the giant orc landed atop the wall, dominating
            the space. The shadow of the two monsters, backlit by the sun,
            stretched long over the soldiers’ heads, eliciting terrified
            screams. Kalken grinned.
          </p>
          <p>“Now, let’s show them something special!”</p>
          <p>
            The greatsword slashed through the air, its radiant green Blade Aura
            shimmering with destructive power. Kalken brought the sword down.
          </p>
          <p>“Thunder Drop!”</p>
          <p>
            A green lightning bolt struck the wall. The atmosphere itself seemed
            to scream with the harsh sound of thunder.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The lightning pierced the wall and the ground beneath, creating a
            devastating explosion. The entire wall erupted as if struck by a
            meteor. Amid the yellow dust, the shattered remains of the wall were
            clearly visible. The sturdy wall that had protected the capital for
            centuries now lay in ruins, as if sliced through like a birthday
            cake. Even a full volley from a trebuchet wouldn’t have achieved
            such destruction. Soldiers muttered in terror.
          </p>
          <p>“So this is the power of an Aura User…”</p>
          <p>
            The dwarven Aura Users, having finally dismounted their horses, were
            similarly wreaking havoc. Relieved to be rid of their mounts, they
            climbed the wall and gleefully struck at it with their aura-enhanced
            weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each strike of a hammer or axe infused with aura caused the wall to
            crumble like a sandcastle. There was no need to target the soldiers.
            Most had already fled, or were being buried alive under the
            collapsing wall.
          </p>
          <p>“Everyone’s doing great.”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla pouted as she watched the other Aura Users. Before this
            battle, Repenhardt had given them specific instructions.
          </p>
          <p>
            – Make it as spectacular as possible! Make the walls crumble just by
            looking at them. No need to target the soldiers. Just bring down the
            walls.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his past life, Repenhardt had found great success in demolishing
            walls, and he had asked them to do the same. Despite not directly
            targeting the soldiers, the collateral damage had already claimed
            hundreds of lives.

          <p>
            [ Chapter 139 ]<br />
            Stalla frowned slightly as she looked at the wall.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm, what should I do…”</p>
          <p>
            Typically, most Aura Users wouldn’t use such a massive technique
            capable of demolishing a wall, except for someone like Kalken who
            foolishly pursued brute strength, dwarves who used the power of
            earth resonance, or someone like Russ who excelled at stealing
            others’ techniques. Generally, there was no skill for it, nor was
            there any need.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was no reason to train in a technique that was easy to dodge
            and had such immense destructive power, primarily intended to kill
            people. Honestly, why waste a perfectly good wall? An Aura User
            could simply fly over the wall, kill the soldiers nearby, and take
            over the area.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But it’s embarrassing to be the only one who can’t do it when
            everyone else is.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s skills were by no means inferior to theirs. However, in her
            approach to using Aura, she favored precision and accuracy over
            brute force, much like most modern Aura Users.
          </p>
          <p>
            After pondering for a moment, Stalla’s eyes suddenly lit up. She
            realized she had a method. She smiled coldly and waved her hands.
          </p>
          <p>“Go! My twelve sisters!”</p>
          <p>
            Twelve daggers imbued with Aura shot out, becoming flashes of light.
            Their mere momentum split the air, causing a storm and tearing up
            the ground. Twelve beams of light tore through the earth, splitting
            the sky, and embedded themselves in various parts of the wall.
          </p>
          <p>Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!</p>
          <p>
            A series of explosions echoed as the wall shook in multiple places.
            With her eyes gleaming, Stalla shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“Scream! My sisters!”</p>
          <p>Woooooong!</p>
          <p>
            The daggers embedded in the wall resonated, shaking violently. The
            Aura contained within them harmonized, shaking the entire wall. The
            wall, the surrounding ground, and even the distant fortress of
            Carsus trembled as if an earthquake had struck.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>“What the hell is this!”</p>
          <p>
            It was at this moment that Spirius cursed and supported Carsus.
            Suddenly, the entire wall collapsed.
          </p>
          <p>Rumble!</p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s daggers, embedded in various parts of the wall, caused a
            chain reaction of explosions, destroying the wall’s structure. The
            vast wall, nearly 100 meters long, collapsed all at once, sending up
            clouds of yellow dust. Stalla alone had caused as much destruction
            as all the other Aura Users combined.
          </p>
          <p>Kalken muttered, slightly surprised.</p>
          <p>“Huh? Who knew my wife could do that?”</p>
          <p>The dwarves rounded their mouths in astonishment and exclaimed.</p>
          <p>“Oh, that’s a fresh demolition technique.”</p>
          <p>“Right, do orcs have talent in architecture too?”</p>

          <p>
            “That lady would be great to call for demolishing buildings later.”
          </p>
          <p>And Russ was grinning slyly, his eyes sparkling.</p>
          <p>
            “Sweet, got another one. That looks like something I could master
            with a bit of practice.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The southern wall of the royal city of Krotin, boasting a long and
            storied history, was no longer a wall thanks to the misdeeds of the
            six Aura Users. Carsus muttered in despair.
          </p>
          <p>“Damn, I didn’t expect them to come out like this.”</p>
          <p>
            If the gate was destroyed or the wall was occupied, there were
            strategies to counter that. But with the entire wall completely
            demolished, there was no solution. Sir Spirius gritted his teeth.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’m sorry. If it were just one or two of them, I could handle it…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Sir Spirius couldn’t leave Carsus’s side at the moment. If those
            Aura Users aimed for Carsus’s life, he was the only one who could
            stop them. Carsus clicked his tongue and rubbed his forehead.
          </p>
          <p>“This is why I tried to avoid a siege at all costs…”</p>
          <p>
            If the battle were fought on the plains in a pitched battle, there
            were ways to manage even with fewer Aura Users. No matter how
            skilled an Aura User was, they couldn’t focus their Aura on
            full-body defense throughout the entire battle. The only group on
            the continent known for such extreme physical training was Gym
            Unbreakable; most Aura Users would lose focus or get tired, making
            them vulnerable to stray arrows or swords. With a mass assault, even
            regular knights could defeat an Aura User, though it would come at a
            great cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            But in a siege, there was no strategy. They couldn’t overwhelm with
            numbers, and with the Aura Users’ agility, moving between buildings
            and cover rendered arrows useless.
          </p>
          <p>“We have no choice. We must retreat to the palace.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed…”</p>
          <p>
            With a heavy heart, Carsus nodded at Sir Spirius’s suggestion. With
            the wall completely destroyed, there was no point in holding the
            defense. They needed to quickly retreat to the palace and reorganize
            their forces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then, surprisingly, the Aura Users and Prince Yubel’s army
            simultaneously retreated.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>“Why are they withdrawing from a battle they’ve already won?”</p>
          <p>
            Leaving the puzzled forces of Carsus behind, Prince Yubel’s army
            returned to their main camp. A herald came out and shouted again.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Traitor! Your life is already in Prince Yubel’s grasp! You must
            have realized that if we wished, we could advance to the palace
            right now!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Carsus had nothing to say. There was no flaw in their words.
            Retreating to the complex royal palace would only provide more
            opportunities for the Aura Users to wreak havoc.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But how can a true king put the citizens of the royal city at risk?
            If you truly care for their safety, raise the white flag and
            surrender yourself to judgment!”
          </p>
          <p>Carsus’s expression hardened.</p>
          <p>“They’re playing it like this…”</p>
          <p>
            Prince Yubel intended to not only claim victory but also strip
            Carsus of his popularity. In this situation, Carsus would be seen as
            holding the citizens of the capital hostage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Carsus had considered using the citizens as hostages in a
            siege, but he had dismissed the plan, believing Prince Yubel
            wouldn’t care about their safety. However, Yubel’s forces had gone a
            step further, using the citizens as leverage to pressure Carsus.
          </p>

          <p>‘What kind of vile person came up with this tactic?’</p>
          <p>
            ‘Given Carsus’s character, he won’t continue the siege after hearing
            such words.’
          </p>
          <p>
            That vile person, Repenhardt, was chuckling as he looked at the
            shattered wall of Krotin. He knew Carsus’s character well and had
            purposely devised this strategy. This way, not only would the damage
            be minimized, but Prince Yubel’s popularity would also rise
            significantly.
          </p>
          <p>
            A prince who thinks of his people’s safety even at the brink of
            victory!
          </p>
          <p>
            This was more than enough to restore the fallen reputation of Prince
            Yubel.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Repenhardt, you truly are a wise man. Given Carsus’s temperament,
            he won’t remain holed up in the castle after hearing those words. It
            seems this war is my victory,” Prince Yubel said, praising
            Repenhardt’s wisdom with a satisfied expression. Repenhardt wore a
            slightly embarrassed smile. In truth, he felt awkward because he was
            merely using information from his previous life rather than
            possessing exceptional strategic and tactical prowess.
          </p>
          <p>Count Feonin also looked pleased.</p>
          <p>
            “Then let us return to Viscount Zedrin’s mansion for now. Seeing
            such a display of strength, they will soon surrender. There is no
            need to shed more blood.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With that, Prince Yubel’s forces raised their banners proudly and
            withdrew from the capital, leaving the despaired Carsus behind.
          </p>
          <p>It was a flawless victory.</p>
          <p>
            In the office within the royal palace of the capital, Krotin, where
            the king once conducted the kingdom’s affairs, several nobles were
            now gathered, all wearing faces of despair.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Duke of Fernando, a robust middle-aged man of fifty, furrowed
            his brow deeply and spoke.
          </p>
          <p>
            “What do you think, Prince Carsus? Do we have any way to seize the
            advantage now?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Duke of Fernando addressed his son, Carsus, using formal speech,
            reinforcing his son’s authority as the heir. The elderly Marquis of
            Brozen, with his white hair, shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ha ha, I don’t know. I can’t fathom what those lowly creatures have
            done, but it’s undeniable that they possess the strength worthy of
            Aura Users.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everyone was intimidated by the power of the alien Aura Users who
            had demolished the wall. Despite being competent knights and
            commanders, their minds were paralyzed in the face of such
            terrifying feats.
          </p>
          <p>Even Carsus, whose mind was still clear, had no solution.</p>
          <p>“Where on earth did they get such power…?”</p>
          <p>
            Six Aura Users were practically the equivalent of a national
            military force. No matter how ingenious their strategies, there was
            no way to counter it.
          </p>
          <p>One of the nobles cautiously offered a suggestion.</p>
          <p>
            “They’ve arrogantly withdrawn without even besieging Krotin. Perhaps
            we should retreat and plan for the future…”
          </p>
          <p>Carsus shook his head.</p>
          <p>
            “That won’t work. They already possess the seal and the crown. The
            moment we lose the Sacred Scepter, Prince Yubel can hold a
            coronation. Losing this capital means our defeat. They withdrew
            knowing we would understand this.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “I understand, but isn’t there no other way right now? If we retreat
            and engage in a prolonged conflict, while seeking aid from the
            Principality of Chatan or the Vasily Kingdom…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Carsus waved his hand dismissively, seeing no value in that
            suggestion.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Allowing foreign intervention would lead to the fall of the
            Crovence Kingdom, even if we win.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Crovence Kingdom, with its long and storied history, could not
            afford to make the mistake of allowing foreign interference. The
            noble who had suggested it spoke regretfully.
          </p>
          <p>“But if we don’t, Lord Carsus, you will fall!”</p>
          <p>Carsus quickly saw through the true intent behind those words.</p>
          <p>‘Precisely, they fear their own downfall.’</p>
          <p>
            He felt nothing but contempt for those willing to sell out the
            country to protect themselves. Seeing Carsus’s expression, the noble
            flinched and fell silent. Yet, others seemed to secretly agree with
            that sentiment. Even his father and grandfather seemed to be
            considering it!
          </p>
          <p>“Sigh…”</p>
          <p>
            Carsus sighed. He had no intention of selling out the Crovence
            Kingdom, even if it meant losing his own life. However, his
            followers thought differently.
          </p>
          <p>Then Marquis Brozen muttered regretfully.</p>
          <p>“We should have assassinated that despicable prince.”</p>
          <p>“We’ve already tried several times, haven’t we?”</p>
          <p>Carsus responded wearily.</p>
          <p>
            The forces of Carsus had already sent numerous assassins to kill
            Prince Yubel. Sacrificing a few lives in this way was far less
            costly than plunging the kingdom into civil war, so Carsus had no
            qualms about it.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, all assassination attempts had failed. Finia, who was
            always by Yubel’s side, had thwarted every attempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finia, who could hear the truth, could detect any assassin, no
            matter how well they disguised themselves. It was not feasible to
            order an assassin to infiltrate the castle and eliminate the guards
            before killing Prince Yubel.
          </p>
          <p>
            The common people might believe that a famed assassin could sneak up
            on their target and kill them unnoticed, then disappear like the
            wind, but the reality was not so simple. If an assassin had such
            skill, why would they work as an assassin? They could easily secure
            a knight’s position anywhere.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If we had someone with that level of skill and trustworthiness, it
            would have to be…”
          </p>
          <p>
            The nobles all turned their eyes to Sir Spirius. If anyone had the
            capability to infiltrate and kill Prince Yubel, it was the Aura User
            among them.
          </p>
          <p>The Duke of Fernando pleaded.</p>
          <p>“Sir Spirius, is it truly impossible?”</p>
          <p>
            There had been subtle requests made to Spirius before, and once
            again, he declined for the same reason.
          </p>
          <p>
            “No matter how vile he is, he carries the blood of the Emperor. As a
            knight, I cannot commit such treachery.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The nobles sighed in unison. Their collective sigh carried an
            undercurrent of frustration toward Sir Spirius’s stubbornness.
          </p>
          <p>Then, Sir Spirius changed his expression and spoke up.</p>
          <p>“However, regarding the idea of assassination, I agree.”</p>
          <p>“Hmm?”</p>
          <p>
            Carsus looked at him with surprised eyes. Sir Spirius’s eyes
            gleamed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Instead of Prince Yubel, let’s assassinate that mysterious mage,
            Repenhardt.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Carsus had ordered the collection of every piece of information, no
            matter how trivial. It had long been known that Repenhardt had
            brought those mysterious beings.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Those slaves are rampaging because of that mage, aren’t they? If we
            eliminate him, they’ll likely revert to their docile nature.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Carsus and the nobles pondered this plan. Repenhardt was the key
            figure who had orchestrated the recent events, and removing him
            might indeed destabilize Yubel’s advantage.

          <p>[ Chapter 140 ]</p>
          <p>Karsas slightly furrowed his brows.</p>
          <p>‘Really?’</p>
          <p>
            An existence as powerful as an Aura User was simply born from magic?
            It was a story hard to believe. Moreover, the non-human beings he
            had seen did not look like they were being controlled. Karsas prided
            himself on his ability to read people. It seemed clear to him that
            they had all decided of their own will to participate in this
            battle.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the other nobles all nodded enthusiastically in agreement.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh! That’s a brilliant idea!”</p>
          <p>“If only those strange creatures disappear, there’s hope!”</p>
          <p>
            “It’s all because of them that the situation turned out like this!”
          </p>
          <p>
            After a moment of hesitation, Karsas also nodded. In any case, there
            was no harm in trying. If killing the mage would truly calm the
            non-humans, it would be a great relief. And even if it failed, the
            situation could not get any worse than it already was.
          </p>
          <p>The only concern was…</p>
          <p>“But what if something happens to Sir Spirius?”</p>
          <p>
            Karsas did not want Spirius to meet a dishonorable death as an
            assassin rather than as a knight of the battlefield. However,
            Spirius shook his head firmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “For the sake of Lord Karsas, I can bear such a risk. And I am not
            that weak. Even if the assassination fails, I have the skills to
            escape with my life.”
          </p>
          <p>At that moment, Marquis Brozen voiced another concern.</p>
          <p>
            “But what if they aim for an assassination while Sir Spirius is
            away?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Spirius had been staying close to Karsas to guard against
            assassination attempts by Aura Users. If he were to leave, there
            would be no way to prevent an assassination attempt from the enemy.
          </p>
          <p>Spirius gave a bitter smile.</p>
          <p>
            “To be honest, even if I am guarding him, if more than two Aura
            Users attack, I won’t be able to stop the assassination.”
          </p>
          <p>“Hmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Though he might insist that his defeat by Russ was a fluke, the fact
            remained that the enemy had six Aura Users. If they decided to carry
            out an assassination, Karsas would be dead whether Spirius was there
            or not.
          </p>
          <p>“I see, my neck was already half-severed.”</p>

          <p>With a bitter smile, Karsas nodded.</p>
          <p>“Then, Sir Spirius, I’m afraid I must ask you to do this.”</p>
          <p>Spirius, steeling his resolve, bowed respectfully.</p>
          <p>“I will ensure that I do not betray Lord Karsas’s trust.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Having left Count Hendrik’s castle, Prince Yubel’s army was now
            setting up camp at the villa of Viscount Zedrin, located on the
            outskirts of the capital. Viscount Zedrin’s villa was close to the
            capital, had ample space around it for setting up tents, and was
            near a forest and spring, making it an ideal location for a
            campsite.
          </p>
          <p>
            That evening, Prince Yubel held a victory celebration. All the
            soldiers were given wine and meat, and nobles and knights gathered
            at Viscount Zedrin’s mansion to enjoy a lavish—though modest by
            noble standards—banquet.
          </p>
          <p>
            It might seem a bit strange to hold a banquet when the war was not
            yet over. However, this was a necessary act. Now, Prince Yubel’s
            army had grown to nearly ten thousand strong, with many neutral
            nobles joining the ranks. Such a format was essential for promoting
            harmony between the existing forces and these neutral nobles.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yubel, seated at the head table, suddenly stood up, raising a golden
            goblet, and shouted:
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let us celebrate those who have joined us in securing the future of
            the Kingdom of Crovence! Today’s victory is thanks to all of you, so
            eat and drink to your hearts’ content!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The nobles and knights seated at the tables responded in unison,
            raising their glasses.
          </p>
          <p>“For the true king!”</p>
          <p>
            Immediately, generous servings of wine and meat in silverware
            followed. Servants busily carried the food, and maidservants
            attended the tables. As it was a banquet during wartime, it lacked
            the elegant atmosphere of a ball. Everyone, clad in armor, enjoyed
            the food and drink in a feast of the battlefield.
          </p>
          <p>
            The banquet hall quickly became lively. Sitting down, Yubel muttered
            to Repenhardt beside him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I said those words, but honestly, what have they done to deserve
            praise…?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, who had become an important figure in Prince Yubel’s
            army, confidently sat to the prince’s right. He responded with a wry
            smile and a low voice.
          </p>
          <p>“…That’s precisely why we need to praise them even more.”</p>
          <p>
            In today’s battle, the nobles and knights had done almost nothing.
            The nobles had only conscripted the infantry who acted as bait, and
            the knights had merely ridden their horses before returning. The
            actual battle had been entirely handled by the Aura Users.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, such ceremonial acts were even more necessary. They had
            to share the credit with them to reduce the envy and jealousy
            directed at the other races.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, nonchalantly raising his glass, continued loudly this
            time.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Fools praise only those who shine in battle, but wise men can see
            the bigger picture. Although my allies have shown remarkable
            prowess, without the brave knights and the formidable forces of the
            noblemen standing proudly behind them, how could such a display have
            been possible? It is thanks to them that we can truly intimidate
            those rebels, is it not?”
          </p>

          <p>
            He had deliberately spoken loudly for everyone to hear. The nobles
            and knights, who were drinking, reacted with bright expressions and
            started chattering enthusiastically.
          </p>
          <p>“Lord Repenhardt’s praise embarrasses us! Hahaha!”</p>
          <p>“Indeed! Unlike fools, Lord Repenhardt understands war well!”</p>
          <p>
            “He clearly sees what ordinary people cannot, truly a wise man!
            Hahaha!”
          </p>
          <p>
            The nobles and knights were, in fact, somewhat embarrassed by this
            celebration. They knew better than anyone else that they had done
            nothing. Even if Repenhardt claimed all the credit for himself, they
            couldn’t honestly refute it.
          </p>
          <p>
            But now, Repenhardt was soothing their egos. They were recognized
            for their important role in the battle. With lighter hearts, the
            nobles and knights began to enjoy the feast. Their gazes towards
            Repenhardt grew increasingly favorable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seeing the change in atmosphere, Yubel was inwardly impressed. He
            had heard that Repenhardt was just a mage, but his political acumen
            was excellent. There had been quite a few nobles who felt uneasy
            about his presence. However, looking at their expressions now, many
            of their complaints seemed to have vanished.
          </p>
          <p>‘Hmm, I need to learn from this.’</p>
          <p>
            Count Feonin, seated to Yubel’s left, burst into hearty laughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Despite his young age, Lord Repenhardt is adept at dealing with
            people. This Feonin is genuinely impressed. Hahaha!”
          </p>
          <p>“Haha, you flatter me.”</p>
          <p>Raising his glass, Repenhardt smiled wryly.</p>
          <p>‘I’m not exactly young, you know.’</p>
          <p>
            In his previous life, he had even been an emperor. Although he had
            suppressed many things with magic, understanding how people’s hearts
            worked was not beyond him. Whether human or of another race,
            people’s hearts were essentially the same. No matter how different
            cultures and customs were, the most basic aspects did not change.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Everyone gets jealous when they see others doing well, after all.’
          </p>
          <p>Sipping his drink, Repenhardt scanned the banquet hall.</p>
          <p>
            In addition to the humans, leaders of the orcs, dwarves, and elves
            were also attending the banquet. On the orc side, Kalken, Stalla,
            and the blacksmith Gralta were eating meat among the humans. The
            dwarves were represented by three Aura Users, and the elf side had
            Relhard, the chief of the Dahnhaim clan, accompanied by a male elf
            who seemed to be his lieutenant, drinking gracefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            Naturally, both humans and other races kept their distance, unsure
            how to interact with each other. Mediating between them was the
            young saint, Sillan.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Lord Kalken, this is Viscount Halton, a renowned figure in the
            Kingdom of Crovence. Viscount Halton, this is Lord Kalken, chieftain
            of the Blue Bear Tribe.”
          </p>
          <p>“P-Pleased to meet you, Lord Kalken. I’m Halton.”</p>
          <p>“I’m pleased as well, Viscount Halton. I am Kalken.”</p>

          <p>
            Currently, Kalken was speaking the common language very fluently.
            This was thanks to the magical artifact around his neck, the
            “Necklace of Communication.” This enchanted necklace, which
            contained a high-level translation spell, was crafted by Repenhardt
            in the spare moments between battles, and it translated Orcish
            almost perfectly into the common language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt understood well the importance of language in
            facilitating understanding between different parties. In his
            previous life, he had made sure that high-ranking orcs who
            interacted frequently with humans were equipped with these
            necklaces. Now, due to a lack of magic power, materials, and time,
            he had only been able to gift them to Kalken, Stalla, and Gralta.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘When conditions permit, I need to mass-produce these and distribute
            them to at least the orc warriors.’
          </p>
          <p>
            The human nobles, meanwhile, were experiencing a culture shock at
            meeting an “educated” orc for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>“You speak the common language quite fluently.”</p>
          <p>
            “Repenhardt gifted me this wonderful necklace. It’s a joy to be able
            to communicate properly. Haha…”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Your subordinates are incredibly brave, unlike what one might
            expect from orcs.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken was about to frown at the remark about being “unlike orcs,”
            but Stalla quickly interjected.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Haha, that is precisely what it means to be an orc. We revere
            warriors and despise cowards. Viscount Halton, you are indeed a
            brave man, so we are happy to have you as an ally.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Haha, my lady flatters this unworthy man. How could my skills
            compare in the eyes of one who wields aura?”
          </p>
          <p>
            The conversation ended amicably in the warm atmosphere. Viscount
            Halton, looking to network with others, raised his glass and moved
            on. Kalken, still with a hearty laugh on his face, muttered in
            Orcish.
          </p>
          <p>“Unlike orcs, my foot. And that weakling, a warrior?”</p>
          <p>
            “We knew we’d hear such comments, didn’t we? Just drink your wine.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah, you’re right. Cheers.”</p>
          <p>
            Stalla’s graceful responses were all thanks to Repenhardt’s repeated
            coaching. In his previous life, he had ample experience with how
            humans reacted to orcs. This time, he even held a rehearsal before
            the banquet, gathering the non-human leaders to teach them how to
            handle human interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Don’t expect too much from humans. They won’t understand you
            anyway. Just go along with it.”
          </p>
          <p>At first, the leaders had reacted unfavorably.</p>
          <p>
            As orcs, dwarves, and elves, they were filled with pride for their
            respective races. How could they possibly adjust to human culture
            and customs? Repenhardt acknowledged that their opinions were valid.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, in his past life, he had been called the Demon King,
            scorched the continent, and brought the empire to ruin. He couldn’t
            afford to make the same mistakes again. Repenhardt patiently calmed
            them and explained his reasons.
          </p>
          <p>
            -It’s to save your oppressed kin. We all acknowledge that the
            continent currently belongs to humans, don’t we? If we want to
            assert our own rights, we must first acknowledge others’. We’re the
            ones in need, so we must first acknowledge them and then make them
            understand us.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dwarves, trusting their savior would not speak empty words,
            agreed to do as he suggested. The elves, being rational by nature,
            immediately recognized that this was not the time to stand on pride.
          </p>
          <p>But the orcs resisted.</p>
          <p>
            “As warriors, we have our pride. Why should we adjust to humans?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalken, Stalla, and Gralta were still dissatisfied with Repenhardt’s
            proposal. To the straightforward-thinking orcs, this behavior seemed
            cowardly. However, Repenhardt, who had dealt with countless orcs in
            his past life, knew exactly how to persuade them.
          </p>
          <p>“They give us land.”</p>
          <p>
            Don’t orcs also praise warriors who bring back food? What I’m
            teaching you now is the human way of showing gratitude to those who
            give them land. If you praise them in your way, humans will consider
            it an insult. Isn’t it also dishonorable as a warrior to fail to
            properly praise someone who deserves it because of stubbornness?
          </p>
          <p>
            Hearing this, it made sense. In the end, the orcs acknowledged that
            Repenhardt’s words were reasonable and decided to follow his
            guidance.
