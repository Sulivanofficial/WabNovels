          <p>[ Chapter 91 ]</p>
          <p>
            Bright was heavily sighing and taking steps forward when suddenly,
            one of the mercenaries following him furrowed his brows while
            looking towards the horizon of the desert.
          </p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>After scrutinizing something, he suddenly called out to Bright.</p>
          <p>“Captain Bright! An elf female is running this way!”</p>
          <p>
            An elf! Moreover, a female! Bright turned his head in surprise, his
            eyes twinkling brightly.
          </p>
          <p>“Wow! A fully grown female!”</p>
          <p>
            From across the desert, a platinum-haired elf girl was sprinting
            towards them. She wasn’t quite a mature woman, but she had clearly
            passed puberty, enough to fetch a good price. It was evident why she
            was running towards them; she was holding a sword, seemingly
            charging to save her kin.
          </p>
          <p>
            A scoff escaped him. Could she really be thinking of taking them on
            alone, despite the clear power disparity? Elves really were foolish
            wild creatures.
          </p>
          <p>Drawing his sword, Bright exclaimed with excitement.</p>
          <p>
            “Boys! A pouch of gold coins is running our way! Get ready to catch
            it!”
          </p>
          <p>
            His legs pounded the sands, his eyes clearly viewing the figures
            beyond the sands.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her kinsfolk, tied up like cattle or horses, dragged along in a
            pitiful state.
          </p>
          <p>
            Tears welled up in her eyes. It was certain. These were the Dahnhaim
            tribesfolk who had lived in this wilderness for centuries. Her
            family had not been destroyed. They were still preserving their
            lineage.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, she could clearly see the humans dragging them
            away. A flame sparked in Siris’s eyes.
          </p>
          <p>“Uuuuugh…”</p>
          <p>
            Anger surged within her. This wasn’t the silent, icy cold anger she
            always felt while living as a slave. It wasn’t the sad, powerless
            anger that she had simply ignored and accepted as reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            The heat of her entire body suppressed the desert’s hot winds. A
            scorching, blazing rage boiled within her chest. The boiled-over
            rage turned into flames, seemingly burning her entire body. Siris
            let out a fierce shout.
          </p>
          <p>“Aaaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Bright’s group watched the approaching Siris with puzzled
            expressions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initially, they had been happy about the easy money. She was coming
            at them without the need for them to chase her, a stroke of luck
            they naïvely rejoiced over. But as the elf girl drew closer, her
            appearance seemed increasingly troubling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Bright’s group wasn’t sharp enough to feel wary of
            Siris’s intensity. If they were that perceptive, they wouldn’t have
            picked a fight with Repenhardt in the first place. What puzzled them
            was something else.
          </p>
          <p>One of them stared blankly and muttered.</p>

          <p>“Hey, what’s up with her clothes…?”</p>
          <p>
            The attire of the wild elves here was, to put it simply, only
            slightly better than that of beasts. Their primary garments were
            ragged clothes, crudely made from cactus fibers and charred wood,
            barely fit to be called sacks. Yet, the attire of this elf seemed
            like it could belong to a renowned noblewoman knight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, the scimitar she carried was keenly sharp, unlike ordinary
            swords. It was a genuine piece, incomparable to the stone swords,
            bronze swords, or wooden swords typically used by the wild elves.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this was happening, Siris had already approached right up to
            Bright and his party. One of the mercenaries, smirking, stepped
            forward.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, she’s just an elf female after all.”</p>
          <p>
            With a face full of scorn, the mercenary raised his axe
            threateningly. “Here we go, I’ll chop you down. Scared? Are you
            scared?”
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, a blue flash struck the mercenary’s body three
            times.
          </p>
          <p>“…Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Confusion filled the mercenary’s eyes as his body was sliced into
            four pieces. Siris had swiftly delivered four cuts in a single
            breath, gruesomely chopping him up. The head of the still confused
            mercenary flew high into the air, followed by blood spraying like a
            fountain in all directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something warm splattered on his face. Bright uttered in a dazed
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>“…Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris lunged again. With a low stance, she moved like a snake,
            taking swift steps left and right, charging fiercely at another
            mercenary. Just when the mercenary, startled, raised his sword to
            block, there was a cry.
          </p>
          <p>“Ughhh!”</p>
          <p>Clang!</p>
          <p>
            With a loud metallic sound, the mercenary’s sword shattered.
            Unbeknownst to the untrained eye, the scimitar Siris wielded was a
            masterpiece forged by the master dwarf smiths of the Grand Forge,
            perfectly tailored to her physique. It was crafted from mithril and
            steel, and occasionally, Repenhardt, who had recovered some of his
            magical powers, had also cast supportive spells on it. No
            mass-produced sword by a human blacksmith could compare.
          </p>
          <p>Crack!</p>
          <p>
            Siris’s scimitar, having broken the mercenary’s sword, sliced
            directly through his chest. The mercenary, who hadn’t bothered to
            wear proper armor due to the desert heat, was easily cut through
            flesh and bone.
          </p>
          <p>Splash!</p>
          <p>
            Once again, a fountain of blood spread in all directions. The golden
            sands were covered with a spreading red sea. Bright’s eyes widened.
            He was suddenly alert. This was no ordinary elf!
          </p>
          <p>“Shit! Catch her, everyone!”</p>
          <p>
            Bright yelled furiously. Finally, the mercenaries snapped to
            attention and began to seriously engage Siris.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Under the desert sun, Siris’s platinum blonde hair sparkled
            splendidly. With her hair fluttering, she twisted her body and
            leaped into the air. The spinning scimitar scattered blades in every
            direction. The wrists of the mercenaries attacking from both sides
            were deeply cut, exposing stark white bones.
          </p>

          <p>“Aargh!”</p>
          <p>“Aaah!”</p>
          <p>
            Screaming, the two mercenaries clutched their wrists and retreated.
            Still airborne, Siris swung her sword, shaking off the blood. The
            blood and oil of the human she had just sliced were scattered along
            the blade, falling off like water droplets on a parsnip leaf.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was thanks to the moisture and oil-repellent magic that
            Repenhardt had cast for her. Although the sword was not yet
            enchanted with the essential Sharpness magic due to insufficient
            skill, the effect was still sufficient. The biggest factor slowing
            down a sword’s sharpness is human blood and oil. Siris’s scimitar,
            no matter how many people it sliced through, would not dull from the
            human oils.
          </p>
          <p>
            Like a goddess of death scattering blood, one of the mercenaries
            exclaimed in awe.
          </p>
          <p>“What the hell! Such ferocity for an elf!”</p>
          <p>
            Even in this situation, it seemed he could not grasp the gravity.
            Holding her scimitar upright above her head, Siris landed and
            delivered a downward slash. One mercenary tried to block it with his
            axe, but her momentum-filled scimitar completely sliced through the
            axe handle and cleaved his head in two.
          </p>
          <p>“Aargh!”</p>
          <p>
            With a scream, gray brain matter splattered everywhere. Losing five
            companions in an instant, Bright’s party went berserk and charged at
            her. Siris’s movements grew even faster. Although she lacked the
            blessing of Sillan, her decades of sword training had already turned
            her into a beast. Her movements, reminiscent of a black panther,
            allowed her to dash through the mercenaries, scattering blood in all
            directions. Continuous screams followed.
          </p>
          <p>“Gurk!”</p>
          <p>“Aargh!”</p>
          <p>
            Four more comrades lost a limb each and tumbled on the sand. The
            expressions on the remaining mercenaries’ faces no longer held any
            trace of underestimation. They had realized that they could no
            longer dismiss her as just another elven female.
          </p>
          <p>
            As the mercenaries got serious, Siris’s movements also began to be
            restricted. Although they were the lowest of the low, they were
            mercenaries, having lived by the sword their entire lives. They were
            not simple adversaries who would blindly charge relying on sheer
            numbers like a peasant uprising.
          </p>
          <p>“Haap!”</p>
          <p>
            Three mercenaries synchronized their breaths and thrust their swords
            with a shout. The sharp stabbing attacks came from three directions
            at once. It was a moment when there seemed to be no escape, but
            Siris merely snorted in disdain.
          </p>
          <p>“Hmph!”</p>
          <p>
            In the past, she might have been injured, perhaps even losing an arm
            in such a situation. However, she had also gained considerable
            experience following Repenhardt around. Watching the battles of aura
            users had sharpened her judgment. Such a situation was no longer a
            crisis for her!
          </p>
          <p>
            In that split second, Siris quickly gauged the speed of the three
            incoming blades. She lunged toward the closest sword.
          </p>
          <p>
            Holding her scimitar, she blocked the tip of the opponent’s sword
            with the handle.
          </p>
          <p>Clang!</p>
          <p>
            The handle and the sword tip collided, sending sparks flying. Using
            the momentum, she twisted her body and blocked a stab aimed at her
            back with the blade of her scimitar. The relatively wide blade of
            the scimitar, if timed right, could serve as an excellent shield.
            After intercepting the attack from behind, she slid the blade along
            and reversed it to slash at the neck of another attacker.
          </p>
          <p>Screech!</p>
          <p>
            With a chilling sound, the neck of the last mercenary who had thrust
            at her was cleanly severed. All this happened in the blink of an
            eye. The attacking mercenaries were left stunned, not understanding
            what had just occurred.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, Siris had no reason to wait for her opponents to
            comprehend what had happened.
          </p>
          <p>‘Chance!’</p>
          <p>
            Seizing the moment, she swung her scimitar left and right. The brief
            gap was all it took for the remaining two to spurt blood and fall to
            the ground.
          </p>
          <p>Bright trembled and muttered,</p>
          <p>“Ah, where did that come from!”</p>
          <p>Then, a grave voice rang out from behind.</p>
          <p>
            “Jahud Ron Keliphatina. Oh heat, come into my hand. Become the flame
            that strikes down the enemy! Fire Bolt!”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was then that the mage Kronto, having just dismounted from his
            camel, cast magic towards Siris. A fiery missile cut through the air
            towards her. Startled, Siris stepped back and held her scimitar
            sideways. The fire missile struck the scimitar, causing an
            explosion.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh!”</p>
          <p>
            Groaning, Siris kept retreating. She barely avoided a fatal blow,
            but even the aftermath of the explosion made her whole body shake,
            disrupting her stance. Then, Kronto’s incantation continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Sephira di Krotel, oh earth, extend your hand and reclaim what
            originated from you! Iron Steel!”
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Siris felt an extreme weight and dropped her scimitar.
            Kronto had cast a disarmament spell. Bright breathed a sigh of
            relief upon seeing Siris weaponless.
          </p>
          <p>“Phew, we’ve finally caught her.”</p>
          <p>
            Just as Bright and his group were about to step forward, a majestic
            voice boomed from across the desert.
          </p>
          <p>“Move and you die.”</p>
          <p>
            As if on cue, Bright’s group froze like statues. Living as
            mercenaries, they had been accustomed to all sorts of curses and
            threats like lullabies. Yet, upon hearing this voice, an
            inexplicable chill seized them, and their bodies stiffened.
          </p>
          <p>‘What, what’s this? Why am I reacting like this?’</p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t any kind of magic, yet just a voice had this effect?
            Finding their own actions inexplicably strange, Bright and his group
            instinctively turned towards the source of the voice. And once
            again, they froze. The one who had shouted was ‘flying’ through the
            desert.
          </p>
          <p>
            This was not a human-like action that could be described as
            ‘jumping’ or ‘running’. With every leap, he covered 20 to 30 meters,
            and with each touch of his feet, it was as though magic burst forth,
            sending pillars of sand soaring into the air.
          </p>
          <p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
          <p>Amid the loud noises, one of the mercenaries muttered dumbly.</p>
          <p>“…A monster?”</p>
          <p>
            However, Bright and his seasoned subordinates, veterans from the
            Chrome City Arena, could not afford to mutter leisurely like that.
            They knew all too well the inhumanly large young man approaching
            them.
          </p>
          <p>“That, that’s…”</p>
          <p>“Eeee?”</p>
          <p>“Eek!”</p>
          <p>
            As they each uttered strange noises, the young man swiftly closed
            the distance and landed among them. He then arrogantly surveyed his
            surroundings and smirked coldly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, well, what do we have here? An old acquaintance, perhaps?”
          </p>

          <p>[ Chapter 92 ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt flashed a cold smile as he looked down over the assembly.
            He thought it was a humorous coincidence. To have come all the way
            to the western edge of this distant continent and encounter a
            familiar face.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, since this encounter was anything but pleasant, his
            expression was far from warm. With a predator’s smile, as if he had
            his prey right before him, he glared at Bright.
          </p>
          <p>“So, you’ve been playing the role of a slave hunter here?”</p>
          <p>
            Bright trembled, his face ashen. The terror of that day flashed
            through his mind like a series of rapid images. The memories of
            being beaten to death, to the point where he wished he could just
            die, prodded his brain and stiffened his body.
          </p>
          <p>“You are…”</p>
          <p>
            Really, he felt like cursing the gods for what sin he must have
            committed in a past life to deserve such misfortune.
          </p>
          <p>Then, Kronto, oblivious to everything, shouted.</p>
          <p>“What are you doing, Bright? Energy Bolt!”</p>
          <p>
            For Bright, it was a nightmare revisited, but for Kronto, it was
            merely the appearance of a new enemy. He was perfectly calm, capable
            of casting his magic. The powerful magical energy whirled through
            the air like a boomerang toward Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>Wheezing!</p>
          <p>
            Watching the incoming Energy Bolt, Repenhardt instinctively raised
            his right hand. He intended to draw up his aura to defend as usual.
            Then, a thought struck him.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Wait, there’s no need to physically exert myself anymore, right?’
          </p>
          <p>
            He had regained quite a bit of his magical power, so there was no
            need to fight the old-fashioned way with hands and feet. With his
            right hand raised, Repenhardt traced a symbol in the air.
          </p>
          <p>“Flash of the Shield, Arcane Shield!”</p>
          <p>
            A blue flash surged, and a shield of light enveloped Repenhardt’s
            entire body. It was the Arcane Shield, a 3rd circle anti-magic spell
            specialized in defense.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            The Energy Bolt struck the Arcane Shield, emitting light and
            disintegrating. The Energy Bolt, not being a high-circle spell,
            didn’t have the power to penetrate the Arcane Shield’s magic
            resistance. Kronto muttered in confusion.
          </p>
          <p>“What? Was he a magician?”</p>
          <p>
            And quite a skilled one at that, as he was able to cast the Arcane
            Shield with just a single command word, indicating he was at least
            capable of casting 5th circle spells.
          </p>
          <p>‘Is he a magician of a similar level to me at that age?’</p>
          <p>A tense Kronto shouted to Bright.</p>
          <p>“Tie him down! This time I’ll prepare a proper spell!”</p>
          <p>
            Finally, Bright came back to his senses. Though briefly frozen by
            the nightmares of that day, he realized that they were over thirty
            in number and had a high wizard among them. No matter how strong,
            they could certainly handle a mere young man.
          </p>
          <p>
            Drawing his sword, Bright mustered courage from nowhere and yelled.
          </p>
          <p>“Attack!”</p>
          <p>
            The remaining mercenaries charged at Repenhardt in unison. Knowing
            that he was a mage, they needed to close the distance quickly to
            disrupt his spellcasting. Failing to do so meant they would be the
            ones to suffer. All were experienced mercenaries, aware of what was
            necessary in such situations.
          </p>

          <p>“Taaah!”</p>
          <p>“Uraatcha!”</p>
          <p>
            Each shouted their unique war cries as they surged towards
            Repenhardt from all directions. Repenhardt clasped his hands in
            front of his chest, reciting the runes needed to gather magical
            energy.
          </p>
          <p>“Setafil Land Delphirod Ketana…”</p>
          <p>
            By then, the mercenaries had already reached him, thrusting their
            swords without hesitation towards the large target. Stabbing,
            slashing, and swinging upwards, blades pierced Repenhardt’s body. If
            they could just interrupt his spellcasting, he would pose no threat!
            It was a success!
          </p>
          <p>
            …Or so the mercenaries thought as they were about to smile
            triumphantly.
          </p>
          <p>Ting! Ting-ting-ting!</p>
          <p>
            As they struck, their swords rebounded as if hitting a rock,
            flinging back with powerful force. Some even tore their grips due to
            the momentum. The mercenaries gaped in shock.
          </p>
          <p>“…What?”</p>
          <p>“Uh?”</p>
          <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
          <p>
            Undisturbed by the confused mercenaries, Repenhardt calmly continued
            his spellcasting.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The power of the earth to the sky, the power of the sky to the
            earth. The fallen powers join to gain strength.”
          </p>
          <p>
            His words wove the gathered magical energies into a spell.
            Continuing the chant, Repenhardt slowly rubbed his hands together,
            generating a spark of static electricity. This completed the
            catalyst needed for his spell.
          </p>
          <p>“Kill him!”</p>
          <p>“Don’t let him finish the magic!”</p>
          <p>
            The mercenaries swung their swords frantically, but it was futile.
            No blade could penetrate his body! Just then, Kronto completed his
            spell and shouted.
          </p>
          <p>“…I summon the mighty flame! Fire Blaster!”</p>
          <p>
            A stream of fire cut through the desert heat, heading straight for
            Repenhardt. The mercenaries dodged in all directions, but the pillar
            of flame struck Repenhardt directly.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            A massive explosion erupted, sending billows of black smoke into the
            air. One of the mercenaries muttered absently.
          </p>
          <p>“Did we kill him?”</p>
          <p>
            That was when it happened. A thick arm burst through the black
            smoke, fingers grotesquely twisted, blue lightning crackling between
            them.
          </p>
          <p>A grave voice resonated.</p>
          <p>“Begone, sons of the sky. Strike my foes! Chain Lightning!”</p>
          <p>Crack!</p>
          <p>Lightning struck as if from a clear sky.</p>
          <p>
            The giant serpent of lightning repeatedly devoured its prey. Blue
            bolts discharged wildly, striking dozens of mercenaries in a chain
            reaction as they ran. It was as if a vast net of lightning had
            struck over the mercenaries’ heads. The intense electric shocks
            flailed over twenty mercenaries, hurling them onto the sand.
            Horrific screams echoed.
          </p>

          <p>“Arghhh!”</p>
          <p>“Kuhhh!”</p>
          <p>“Ahhhh!”</p>
          <p>It was chaos.</p>
          <p>
            The smell of burning flesh pierced the nose. Bright blinked
            repeatedly, unable to believe the scene before him.
          </p>
          <p>“…”</p>
          <p>
            At his feet lay more than twenty mercenaries, turned into charred
            corpses. The only survivors were Bright and the original followers
            who had been with him since Chrome City, spared from the nightmare
            attack due to their fear of Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>
            From behind, Kronto’s mumbling filled with confusion could be heard.
          </p>
          <p>“What, what is that? How did he complete the spell?”</p>
          <p>
            The fact that the enemy had wiped out over twenty people with a
            single spell wasn’t surprising. It was common knowledge that a high
            mage’s spell could be this powerful.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, all the mercenaries had desperately rushed in to interrupt the
            spell. They did not fail in their attack. They stabbed, slashed, and
            chopped earnestly. Every attack hit its mark. Yet…
          </p>
          <p>“…why doesn’t he die when he’s stabbed?”</p>
          <p>
            Kronto was merely blinking repeatedly. It was amazing enough that
            the monster could deflect a sword with his bare body, but he even
            withstood Kronto’s magic, Fire Blaster. A spell powerful enough to
            turn a large wagon into a heap of charcoal in an instant!
          </p>
          <p>“…”</p>
          <p>
            Under the hot sun, a cold silence lingered. Bright, Kronto, and the
            few surviving mercenaries all stood with their mouths agape, staring
            at Repenhardt. The situation had so surpassed normalcy that it
            seemed to pause their thinking for a moment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meanwhile, Repenhardt, despite demonstrating such powerful magic,
            was still grumbling discontentedly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Ugh, they should have all turned into charcoal… Indeed, the lack of
            magic power is significant.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, he wasn’t satisfied with the casting speed. It seemed he
            had been stabbed by swords about 20 to 30 times while chanting the
            spell. In his previous life, a spell like Chain Lightning could have
            been cast simply with a start-up word. It looked like he would have
            to rely on Elucion’s voice for a while longer.
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, it’s still about what I expected.’</p>
          <p>
            Clenching his fist, he grinned broadly. It was a spell cast in
            madness, trusting his sturdy physique to bear the brunt. Repenhardt
            himself knew better than anyone that he was not yet proficient
            enough to use the sixth circle spell, Chain Lightning, in actual
            combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            It had been a simple test. Thanks to his cheap Teslon head, his
            magical computation and charging were subpar, but he believed that
            the areas of focus and magical control, which stemmed from the soul,
            would still be intact. However, as with all theories, without actual
            proof, it was merely a hypothesis. Having not used magic in real
            combat for a while, he felt slightly anxious, but the test proved
            his senses responded quite excellently.
          </p>
          <p>“Maybe it’s time to hang up the sign of a mage again?”</p>
          <p>
            Quite satisfied, Repenhardt looked at Bright and Kronto. Then, he
            noticed Siris, who was defensively standing next to a fallen
            scimitar. Repenhardt formed another hand seal and recited a spell.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am the servant of the great mana, borrowing its power to gather
            what has been scattered. Dispel Magic.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A green flash shot from his fingertips, enveloping her scimitar. The
            weight-increasing magic on the scimitar was dispelled, returning it
            to its original weight. Siris quickly reclaimed her weapon. Kronto
            murmured in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“How could you so easily undo my magic?”</p>
          <p>
            The spell, Dispel Magic, though not high in its circle, required a
            clear understanding of the opponent’s magical patterns and flow to
            be effective. This young mage was astonishingly more skilled than
            him, who had dedicated nearly fifty years to magic. The speed of his
            spellcasting and the potency of his Chain Lightning made him realize
            how severely he had underestimated him.
          </p>

          <p>
            Of course, this was because Repenhardt’s current state was quite
            imbalanced, but Kronto had no way of knowing that. Seeing Repenhardt
            effortlessly counter his spell, Kronto’s morale was instantly
            broken.
          </p>
          <p>He shouted in fear.</p>
          <p>“Is it because of those elves? If so, take them all!”</p>
          <p>
            He still believed Repenhardt had attacked them out of greed for the
            elves they possessed. Given the situation, it seemed no other reason
            could suffice. Bright finally came to his senses and exclaimed.
          </p>
          <p>“We will give them up!”</p>
          <p>“No need!”</p>
          <p>“…Yes?”</p>
          <p>
            Then why are you attacking us? Unable to understand the situation,
            Bright’s mouth fell open in confusion. Repenhardt’s expression
            hardened as he stepped forward.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, he asked.</p>
          <p>“How many did you kill?”</p>
          <p>Bright responded with a trembling voice.</p>
          <p>“…Who do you think we killed?”</p>
          <p>“I’m asking how many elves you’ve killed.”</p>
          <p>
            For a moment, Bright and his group could only blink at each other.
            “Why suddenly ask how many elves I’ve killed?” Bright cautiously
            responded, “Maybe around forty…”
          </p>
          <p>
            He might have exaggerated the number a bit, wondering if their
            skills were being assessed for recruitment. His response was tinged
            with a hint of pride. At this, Repenhardt sighed, feeling neither
            anger nor frustration anymore.
          </p>
          <p>“So, that’s how it is…”</p>
          <p>Suddenly, a chilling brilliance flashed in Repenhardt’s eyes.</p>
          <p>“Then I shall exact their vengeance!”</p>
          <p>
            No sooner had he finished speaking than his fist tore through the
            air. Bright’s head burst open as if it had exploded.
          </p>
          <p>Boom!</p>
          <p>
            Flesh and brain matter scattered like petals across the sand of the
            desert. The moment Kronto and the others widened their eyes in
            horror, Repenhardt’s body soared into the sky.
          </p>
          <p>☆ ☆ ☆</p>
          <p>
            Thunderous explosions followed one after another. Golden auras
            scattered in all directions, followed by magical flames and bolts of
            lightning. It didn’t take long for the murderous Repenhardt to
            annihilate those who had lost their will to fight. They could hardly
            resist and were simply killed.
          </p>
          <p>“Screams!”</p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>“Ughhhh!”</p>
          <p>
            Echoing screams filled the sweltering desert, the sight of the
            massacre filling everyone’s vision. Kronto stood there dumbfounded,
            groaning softly.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh…”</p>
          <p>
            His mind felt completely empty. Not a single great spell that he had
            diligently practiced came to mind. Only overwhelming fear filled his
            thoughts, leaving no room for the idea of resistance.
          </p>
          <p>But even amidst the chaos, an unresolved question lingered.</p>
          <p>“Why on earth…”</p>
          <p>
            The number of mercenaries dwindled rapidly. Each encounter with that
            cruel man’s fist left them scattered as bloody masses across the
            desert.
          </p>
          <p>“…why exactly?”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 93 ]</p>
          <p>
            It was incomprehensible. The young man before him possessed immense
            martial prowess, handling seasoned mercenaries like children with
            his martial arts, and wielding magic that seemed even more advanced
            than what he had devoted his life to mastering. It was a spectacle
            too unbelievable to witness. To master such entirely different
            fields to such an extent, especially at such a young age!
          </p>
          <p>Such a monstrous being…</p>
          <p>And what was even more incomprehensible was…</p>
          <p>Why does he want to kill us to such an extent?</p>
          <p>“Argh!”</p>
          <p>
            Another of the few remaining mercenaries screamed a death scream as
            he died. Repenhardt’s eyes, as he tossed the body aside, flickered
            with fiery rage. The light that sprang forth in those eyes was
            unmistakably one of hatred. However, no matter how hard he thought,
            he couldn’t recall doing anything to deserve such profound hatred.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having dealt with the last mercenary, Repenhardt turned his gaze
            towards Kronto. Kronto, who had been bracing himself for magic,
            stood there dumbfounded until all the mercenaries were dead, a
            natural response given the circumstances. If he had the mental
            fortitude and concentration to cast spells under such pressure, he
            wouldn’t have been limited to the sixth circle at his age.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt leaped forward, closing the distance to Kronto in an
            instant. He suddenly reached out and grabbed the slender mage by the
            throat. With just a little more pressure, this thin neck would snap
            like a dry twig.
          </p>
          <p>“Farewell.”</p>
          <p>It was at that moment.</p>
          <p>“Just, wait a moment!”</p>
          <p>
            Kronto finally came to his senses, yelling out loud. A deep sneer
            appeared on Repenhardt’s lips.
          </p>
          <p>“Begging for your life?”</p>
          <p>
            To think that those who had mercilessly taken the lives of elves now
            deemed their own lives precious? With contempt, Repenhardt was about
            to squeeze Kronto’s throat.
          </p>
          <p>Kronto gathered the last of his strength and shouted.</p>
          <p>“At least tell me why I must die!”</p>
          <p>“…Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt unwittingly let out a chuckle. His grip loosened
            slightly.
          </p>
          <p>Typical of a mage…</p>
          <p>
            Normally, he wouldn’t have hesitated and would have just strangled
            him. But his opponent was a mage.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mages live and die by their curiosity, and even with their lives at
            stake, unresolved questions are more crucial to them than the threat
            of death. Repenhardt, who had also reached high levels as a mage,
            could profoundly understand this sentiment.
          </p>
          <p>Well, at least I can tell him why he’s going to die.</p>
          <p>With slightly relaxed power, Repenhardt slowly replied.</p>
          <p>
            “I believe I made it clear earlier. I’m here to collect the blood
            debt of the elves who died.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Sure enough, Kronto’s expression was one of disbelief, as if he
            couldn’t believe what he was hearing. It was a look I had grown all
            too accustomed to seeing; thus, it left little impression on me.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, perhaps because he was a magician, his reaction was
            somewhat different from the others.
          </p>
          <p>“…Was there perhaps a human among those elves?”</p>
          <p>
            Could it be that this young man’s acquaintance was caught and killed
            in their battle? If so, Kronto’s anger could be understandable. This
            was the most plausible explanation Kronto could come up with, given
            his understanding.
          </p>
          <p>But Repenhardt flatly denied his question.</p>
          <p>“I clearly stated I would avenge the elves.”</p>
          <p>
            “So, you mean to say you did this merely because you killed elves?
            Where in the world is there a law like this?”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a voice full of injustice, Kronto raised his voice. Repenhardt
            gave a bitter smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of course, there is no such ‘law’ in the world yet. But that
            doesn’t mean elves deserve to die like this!”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s expression suddenly contorted.</p>
          <p>
            “Didn’t you feel it when you were killing the elves? Were they truly
            just beasts? Did you feel nothing while you slaughtered those who
            think, feel, and act just like humans?”
          </p>
          <p>Kronto’s face twisted.</p>
          <p>
            “You’re mad… Just because they speak and act like humans, you think
            we should treat them as people?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Compared to you people driven by mere desires, they are far more
            human-like. You are a magician, after all. You should know.”
          </p>
          <p>With a cold tone, Repenhardt posed a question.</p>
          <p>“What is the difference between a person and a beast?”</p>
          <p>
            Kronto swallowed hard. The grip around his throat was getting
            stronger. Answering carelessly here would surely lead to his neck
            being snapped. He stammered out his reply.
          </p>
          <p>
            “A person is a being who can think for itself. Who possesses the
            reason to acknowledge the existence of things unseen, who doubts
            even their own self, who seeks a life beyond instinct, and who fears
            the unseen approach of death—that is what a person is.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a philosophical answer that any magician would have learned
            in their youth. Repenhardt nodded.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Then, tell me, is there even one thing among those you mentioned
            that elves do not exhibit?”
          </p>
          <p>Grinding his teeth, Kronto quickly retorted.</p>
          <p>
            “There are many among humans who are not human-like. There are those
            among humans who live as slaves because of their own sins. Elves,
            after all, are a race born to be slaves. Are you denying slavery
            itself?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>“Then, are you claiming to be wiser than the world itself?”</p>
          <p>
            With a cold stare, Repenhardt looked at Kronto, who had now
            forgotten the fear of death and faced him squarely.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I might not be the wisest person in the world, but there is one
            thing I do know.”
          </p>

          <p>Repenhardt began to speak.</p>
          <p>“I do not wish to live as a slave.”</p>
          <p>
            It was a given. No one in the world, after all, would desire to live
            as a slave.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If that’s the case for me, then it would be the same for others.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The all-too-obvious principle that one cannot impose upon others
            what they themselves do not desire.
          </p>
          <p>“Where, then, is the fault in this obvious thought?”</p>
          <p>
            Kronto looked at Repenhardt incredulously, thinking there was only
            one thing.
          </p>
          <p>‘This guy, crazy as he is, is crazy in a logical way.’</p>
          <p>
            Having lived a long and tumultuous life, Kronto felt he had seen all
            sorts of disgrace. Despite the many twists and turns, he had lived
            diligently, but to encounter such a ‘properly mad man’ at this
            stage!
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes, the words were right. They were obviously true. But does life
            always follow theory? There are always those who gain and those who
            lose, such is the nature of the world. There are those who are
            dominated, and those who dominate. More than anything…
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even if you believe so, that does not justify such a massacre, does
            it?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kronto was furious. After hearing the story, he felt it was too
            unjust to die this way.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Let’s say according to your theory, we have committed sins!
            However, hunting other races is not considered illegal anywhere on
            this continent! We were neither taught nor aware of it being a sin,
            so why should that become a reason for us to die?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Can an act committed in ignorance constitute a crime? Kronto touched
            on a fundamental part of the principle of culpability while gauging
            Repenhardt’s reaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, in reality, ignorance does not absolve one legally. But
            the opponent was more theoretical than practical. If one could
            challenge his logic with theory, there might be a way to stop him.
          </p>
          <p>‘Since he’s logically mad, maybe there’s a chance to survive…’</p>
          <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt seemed to understand.</p>
          <p>
            “That might be true… Indeed, you were merely acting according to
            your own morals.”
          </p>
          <p>‘Hm?’</p>
          <p>
            With hopeful eyes, Kronto looked at Repenhardt. Had it worked? But
            Kronto’s face soon turned grim.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Had it been before your people raided the village, before the elves
            were slaughtered, I would not have resorted to such cruelty.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With cold eyes, Repenhardt began to survey the horror at his feet.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But if I were to let you go now, who would avenge the elves who
            died?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kronto’s face began to pale. The grip around his throat was getting
            stronger.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Can it really be said that slaughtering elves, who think, feel, and
            act just like humans, was just ‘an act committed in ignorance, and
            therefore not a crime’? Just because everyone thinks so?”
          </p>

          <p>“Gak! Ghk!”</p>
          <p>
            His breathing became more labored. Kronto’s eyes widened as he
            struggled. But it was as if he were stuck between rocks, unable to
            move at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Even if the culprits did not know they were committing a crime,
            even if it was an act of ignorance, for them, it was an act done
            without any pricking of conscience…”
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt declared firmly.</p>
          <p>“A crime does not cease to be a crime.”</p>
          <p>With his last bit of strength, Kronto lashed out.</p>
          <p>
            “Then are you going to judge others solely based on your own
            beliefs? What kind of extreme arrogance is that!”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, it is indeed arrogance,”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s forearm muscles twitched.</p>
          <p>
            “But to follow the so-called common sense of a twisted society, to
            show humility when you know it is wrong just because everyone
            accepts it…”
          </p>
          <p>Snap!</p>
          <p>
            Kronto’s neck twisted at a strange angle. The eyes of the old mage,
            once full of life, quickly lost their light. Repenhardt let go of
            his hand. Kronto’s body thudded onto the blood-soaked sand.
          </p>
          <p>“…I would rather be arrogant.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            The elven maiden, Shailen, gazed at Repenhardt with a vacant look in
            her eyes. Thanks to her innate hearing, she could clearly hear every
            conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even when Siris first appeared, and when they began to confront the
            slave hunters, Shailen was not at all pleased.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her elven senses told her that this elven girl was from the same
            Dahnhaim clan as herself. However, the girl’s attire was distinctly
            human. It was clear that she was an elf who had fallen into human
            slavery—a being of her clan that had lost all honor and dignity, now
            a slave without any value.
          </p>
          <p>
            As expected, a human, who seemed to be their owner, soon appeared
            and began annihilating the slave hunters. Shailen was well aware of
            how highly elven women were valued in human society, and she quickly
            understood the situation. It was evident that another greedy human
            had come to attack them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus, Shailen remained uninterested even as the slave hunters were
            being killed off. It was merely another human who had come to target
            them instead of the ones who had raided the village. The fate of
            being sold into slavery remained unchanged.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, as she listened to the conversation, something seemed
            strange. According to the big human’s words…
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s almost like… he’s saving us?’</p>
          <p>
            After the battle ended, Siris quickly ran towards the camels. About
            a dozen camels stood idly on the sand, and behind them were elves,
            their wrists bound, standing feebly. Siris swiftly cut the ropes
            with a dagger and asked in a gentle voice, clear in Elvish.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you okay?”</p>
          <p>“……”</p>
          <p>
            Shailen did not respond. Although she had heard Repenhardt’s words,
            she was hesitant to immediately consider them allies, given the many
            wrongs the Dahnhaim clan had suffered at the hands of humans. She
            closed her eyes and began to ponder how she could escape from them
            this time.
          </p>
          <p>Then, Siris continued in an unsure voice.</p>
          <p>“Perhaps…”</p>
          <p>
            Looking at Shailen’s face, she furrowed her brow and hesitantly
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>“…Shailen unnie?”</p>
          <p>
            Startled, Shailen opened her eyes. She stared intensely at the elf
            in front of her, a clanswoman who had become a human slave. Memories
            from decades ago replayed in her mind, and she realized that she
            recognized the face of this elven girl.
          </p>
          <p>“…Serendi?”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 94 ]</p>
          <p>
            The latches of memory slid open. Visions of brightly smiling young
            girls unfurled across her mind like a panorama.
          </p>
          <p>“Look at this, Serendi!”</p>
          <p>
            “Let’s go together, Serendi! Today we’re going to hunt desert
            scorpions!”
          </p>
          <p>That calling voice.</p>
          <p>“Serendi!”</p>
          <p>Her name, received from everyone, called by everyone.</p>
          <p>Serendi El Arephiana.</p>
          <p>“I remember…”</p>
          <p>
            As her name surfaced, other memories began to emerge into the
            consciousness of remembrance. Undoubtedly, the elf maiden before her
            was Shailen, her sister whom she had followed closely in her
            childhood.
          </p>
          <p>Tears welled in Siris’s eyes.</p>
          <p>
            For elves, all children are siblings, and all adults are fathers and
            mothers. And Shailen had been one of her closest among these many
            siblings, the beloved sister who had always led her with a gentle
            smile and embraced her with love.
          </p>
          <p>“You… you were alive…”</p>
          <p>Holding back tears, Siris clasped Shailen’s hands.</p>
          <p>
            It had been their last encounter amidst the catastrophe, the chaos,
            fifty years ago. She had assumed that Shailen, like her, had been
            captured by humans and sold somewhere. But to think she had been
            living so boldly all this time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word “joy” was too mild to describe the warm surge welling up in
            a corner of her heart.
          </p>
          <p>However, Shailen’s response was utterly cold.</p>
          <p>“So, you were alive too.”</p>
          <p>
            It was a chilly voice. Siris stared at her in shock. This was not
            the affectionate face from her memories but one filled with
            contempt, as if she were looking at some dirty insect.
          </p>
          <p>“Shailen, sister?”</p>
          <p>
            Two elven children, hiding behind her, one a boy, alternated their
            gaze between Siris and Shailen, before one asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Do you know each other?”</p>
          <p>“Don’t talk, Laid.”</p>
          <p>
            It was a stern voice. Startled, Laid quickly hid himself again.
            Shailen, with a grave look in her eyes, slowly began,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Becoming a plaything for filthy humans, living without pride or
            honor, you were still alive, Serendi.”
          </p>
          <p>Siris’s face turned pale.</p>
          <p>“I… I…”</p>
          <p>
            No words of rebuttal came to her. Although she believed she had
            never succumbed to humans, she had indeed lived under them, eating
            their food, following their teachings for over fifty years.
            Throughout this time, she had been traded from place to place,
            enduring many humiliations. Fortunately, she had not been defiled,
            but there had been shameful moments where she had been exposed in
            front of filthy humans.
          </p>
          <p>Indeed, was she not merely a plaything for filthy humans?</p>
          <p>
            Could she confidently say that even in that life, she had maintained
            her dignity and honor?
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris’s complexion darkened. She slowly released the hands she had
            been holding with Shailen. The criticisms from the sister she so
            dearly loved were carving through her heart like blades.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris bowed her head. Seeing her expression, Shailen forcibly turned
            her gaze away. She felt a slight ache in her heart.
          </p>

          <p>
            Truthfully, she could not deny that she had been shaken by the words
            of that large human. Perhaps they really had saved them. Perhaps
            they had acted out of pure goodwill, without any greed or
            expectation of reward.
          </p>
          <p>
            But still, the other party was human. And she had been a slave to
            humans.
          </p>
          <p>‘…It is impossible to trust humans…’</p>
          <p>
            Silence lingered. The two young elf children kept glancing between
            Shailen and Siris, gauging the situation. Then, a soft but
            distinctly angry voice broke the silence.
          </p>
          <p>“She is my comrade. She is definitely not a slave.”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Shailen turned her head in surprise. Repenhardt had
            approached and was looking down at her with a stern face. To the
            eye, he was just a burly, seemingly uneducated young human man. Yet,
            impeccably accurate Elvish flowed from his mouth.
          </p>
          <p>“How can a human speak our language?”</p>
          <p>
            Upon reflection, she and Siris had been conversing in Elvish all
            along. If he did not know Elvish, he wouldn’t have been able to
            interject into their conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shailen wore a disbelieving expression. However, Repenhardt seemed
            to have no leisure to clarify her doubts. Like a hen shielding its
            chicks, he stepped in front of Siris and continued sternly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I cannot allow you to continue treating her as a slave, even if you
            are her family.”
          </p>
          <p>
            His voice remained calm, yet it unmistakably conveyed his emotions.
            Shailen’s eyes widened as she looked up at Repenhardt. Her pupils
            quivered slightly.
          </p>
          <p>‘Could it be… is he serious?’</p>
          <p>
            Just as the children of the earth, the Dwarves, could hear the voice
            of truth, the descendants of the spirits, the Elves, could scent
            emotions. However, unlike the Dwarves, this ability among the Elves
            to resonate with others’ feelings was awakened through education and
            training. Thus, it was impossible for Elves living as slaves to
            humans. However, Shailen, who had been trained since childhood, was
            somewhat capable of empathizing with others’ emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt moved closer, the faint scent of emotions wafted
            subtly. A sincere anger intertwined with a painfully intense
            affection tickled her nose.
          </p>
          <p>GPT</p>
          <p>
            Shailen increasingly felt that this person was somehow different
            from others.
          </p>
          <p>“……But……”</p>
          <p>
            Even so, Shailen couldn’t easily open her heart. Despite empathizing
            with emotions, she couldn’t be sure whether her senses were telling
            the truth or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though they were enslaved, the dwarves were still cradled in
            the arms of the earth, unlike the elves who had lost their World
            Tree, Elvenheim. This ability to empathize with emotions was also a
            basic stage in learning spirit magic. Now that the World Tree was
            gone, most elves had lost their spirit magic, and their ability to
            empathize had significantly diminished.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Shailen watched the two in dismay, Repenhardt sighed and turned
            to look at Siris.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris.”</p>
          <p>His voice was slightly irritated. Siris calmly replied.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Lord Repenhardt.”</p>
          <p>“You’re also a problem.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris tilted her head slightly. Repenhardt continued as if
            admonishing her.
          </p>
          <p>“Why can’t you speak? You’re not a slave!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris clammed up. Her complexion turned icy. Repenhardt, frustrated,
            hit his chest.
          </p>
          <p>“Say it clearly. You’re not a slave, you’re a free elf!”</p>
          <p>“……”</p>
          <p>
            Silence lingered. Siris remained silent, her head bowed. Repenhardt
            shook his head, unable to understand. Suddenly, Siris’s eyes
            sharpened.
          </p>
          <p>“Really……”</p>
          <p>
            She lit a fierce glare in her eyes as she looked up defiantly at
            Repenhardt. Startled by her sudden change in demeanor, Repenhardt
            flinched. In a cold voice, she asked.
          </p>

          <p>“Am I not a slave?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt was dumbfounded by her question.</p>
          <p>“No, when have I ever treated you like a slave?”</p>
          <p>
            Certainly, he had never done so. The way Repenhardt had always
            treated her was never as a slave. Siris acknowledged that too.
          </p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>“Then when have I ever acted without asking for your opinion?”</p>
          <p>“Never.”</p>
          <p>“So why do you keep belittling yourself!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s expression was one of utter frustration as he shouted.
            Siris quietly responded.
          </p>
          <p>
            “But Lord Repenhardt, you’ve never once said that I’m not a slave……”
          </p>
          <p>“Uh……?”</p>
          <p>
            He realized in that moment. He had genuinely interacted with Siris.
            He always asked for her opinion and always requested rather than
            commanded. He had shown his intentions through his actions. But he
            had not realized that he had never ‘verbally’ expressed those words.
          </p>
          <p>“Tsk……”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue and shook his head, suddenly feeling
            the full extent of his own obtuseness. With an awkward expression,
            Repenhardt slowly opened his mouth.
          </p>
          <p>“If you want something, just say it clearly.”</p>
          <p>
            He wasn’t sure why, but if she desired it, he was willing to oblige.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You are not a slave. You and I are equals. You are a free elf.”
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Siris was far from pacified. In fact, she seemed even
            angrier. Her eyes narrowed.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m not a slave?”</p>
          <p>“That’s right, you are not a slave.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt’s soothing reply only made Siris bite her lip,
            suppressing the rising tide of her emotions as she spoke.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I know that you do not treat elves like slaves. You treat elves and
            dwarves just like humans. I’m well aware of that.”
          </p>
          <p>“But, why then…”</p>
          <p>
            Confused, Repenhardt looked at Siris as she lifted her head enough
            to shake her platinum blonde hair.
          </p>
          <p>“I don’t know what the problem is… But one thing is clear.”</p>
          <p>
            Her eyes, sharp and clear, fixed on Repenhardt as she enunciated
            each word.
          </p>
          <p>“…You’re… not really looking at me.”</p>
          <p>
            The emotions she had vowed never to express surged up, unwittingly
            forming words on her tongue.
          </p>
          <p>“You see someone else through me…”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>Repenhardt stood frozen as if turned to stone.</p>
          <p>“Uh…”</p>

          <p>
            For a moment, he couldn’t comprehend what Siris had said. He
            couldn’t understand why she would say something like that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, even amidst his confusion, a voice inside him questioned
            independently of his will.
          </p>
          <p>‘Have I truly been looking at her?’</p>
          <p>
            Was he really seeing this delicate elf girl before him now? He might
            have been viewing her with affectionate eyes as if she were someone
            from his memories, but could it truly be said that this affection
            was directed at Siris?
          </p>
          <p>
            His strength drained from his body. His head spun. Complicated
            thoughts swirled through his brain as Siris’s voice reached him.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It didn’t matter anyway. After all, I was just a slave. That way,
            there was no problem.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Her voice seemed to come from a distant place. Repenhardt’s legs
            trembled.
          </p>
          <p>“But if that’s the case, please treat me like a slave.”</p>
          <p>
            He had thought he had saved Siris. He had felt proud, believing he
            had rescued her from a dire fate.
          </p>
          <p>
            It had been a terrible delusion. Repenhardt had never saved her.
            What he had saved was a Siris from a past life. In this era, he was
            nothing more than a human who had bought an elf slave.
          </p>
          <p>“Please don’t speak so earnestly to me.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris reflected from her perspective. A complete stranger had bought
            her, treated her kindly at his whim, showered her with affection,
            and told her she wasn’t a slave…
          </p>
          <p>It sent shivers down her spine.</p>
          <p>“…I cannot accept sincerity that isn’t truly yours.”</p>
          <p>
            Finally revealing her true feelings, Siris looked regretful for a
            moment before she turned to leave. Repenhardt couldn’t follow her.
          </p>
          <p>Whooosh…</p>
          <p>
            The dry sand winds raced over the desert. Camels blinked then
            settled down to begin mumbling among themselves. Repenhardt stood
            frozen, as stiff as a rock.
          </p>
          <p>How much time had passed?</p>
          <p>
            His tangled thoughts began to settle calmly. Yes, there was no fault
            in her words.
          </p>
          <p>She was not wrong at all.</p>
          <p>It was he who was mistaken.</p>
          <p>“Indeed…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt closed his eyes.</p>
          <p>
            He made a decision he did not want to make, feeling fear about what
            would come from it, yet he did not regret this decision. It was the
            only apology he could offer her.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt approached Siris again and called her name.</p>
          <p>“Siris.”</p>
          <p>She did not move. He stuttered as he began to speak.</p>
          <p>“You are free. Nothing will constrain your actions now.”</p>
          <p>She lifted her head slightly.</p>
          <p>“There’s nothing to constrain your actions now.”</p>
          <p>
            She weakly looked up at him, with an expression of confusion as if
            she didn’t understand why he was repeating himself. Repenhardt
            sighed.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s different from before. Whether you stay by my side or leave,
            it’s all up to your will now. Act as you wish. If it’s your will, I
            will respect everything.”
          </p>
          <p>Siris’s eyes widened. Repenhardt pursed his lips.</p>
          <p>“Anywhere else, such words might be mere pretense…”</p>
          <p>
            In this continent, a domain ruled by humans, there is no comfort for
            an elf abandoned by their master. Elsewhere, telling Siris such
            things would be unrealistic because she couldn’t possibly survive
            away from Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“But here is your homeland, where your family is.”</p>
          <p>
            Here, the story was different. Now that he had confirmed that the
            Dahnhaim tribe was still thriving, she could return to her family’s
            embrace at any time. She definitely had a place to stay.
          </p>
          <p>“Do as you wish, Siris, or rather, Serendi El Areliana.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 95 ]</p>
          <p>
            Siris looked up at Repenhardt with surprised eyes, no longer seeing
            him as her master but as this young man. The intense light in his
            eyes was genuine.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you telling me to leave you?”</p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>She slightly furrowed her brows as the conversation continued.</p>
          <p>“I want you to stay by my side.”</p>
          <p>
            It was a hard sentence to comprehend. She made a puzzled face.
            Repenhardt gave a bitter smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I understand why you might feel that way. I can’t explain the
            circumstances, but you can understand them well enough.”
          </p>
          <p>
            It would be useless to make sounds like talking in one’s sleep about
            going back in time; even Makelin, the wisest among the dwarves who
            could hear the voice of truth, didn’t believe him until he saw
            proof. He could endure being abandoned by a loved one, but he
            couldn’t bear being treated as a madman and despised.
          </p>
          <p>All he could do now was to speak earnestly…</p>
          <p>“There is nothing left to bind you now. I merely implore.”</p>
          <p>
            He was not clinging to memories, but facing the delicate girl who
            clearly existed before him.
          </p>
          <p>“I hope you will continue to be with me.”</p>
          <p>Siris looked up at Repenhardt with a vacant gaze.</p>
          <p>Her heart raced.</p>
          <p>An unknown pain flowed from a corner of her heart.</p>
          <p>She was certain.</p>
          <p>
            This man was looking at her, speaking to her, unlike before,
            addressing her, the girl who was still immature, existing here and
            now.
          </p>
          <p>After hesitating, Siris quietly replied.</p>
          <p>“……Please give me some time to think.”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Shailen silently observed the situation. Her initial suspicion and
            fear of Repenhardt had long since dissipated. Watching them, she
            even felt assured that this large human truly did not consider elves
            to be slaves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Repenhardt approached her with a weary gait. It was
            surprising that such a large, muscular man could appear so
            powerless. The depth of the young man’s heartache was palpable.
          </p>

          <p>
            Repenhardt, glancing back and forth between Shailen and the two elf
            children, asked, “Can you return to the village?”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, if only you could lend us a camel…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt smirked and shook his head.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s not ours to give permission for in the first place. If you
            want, you can take them all.”
          </p>
          <p>Shailen’s eyes lit up at that moment.</p>
          <p>
            The ten camels brought by the slave hunters were still idly
            wandering around them, a picture of leisure. For the Dahnhaim tribe,
            enduring harsh desert life, ten camels were a considerable asset.
            Moreover, the camel saddles were laden with water and food gathered
            by the slave hunters. No one could blame Shailen, even if
            uncharacteristic of an elf, for her greedy glance.
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you for saving us, and even for this…”</p>
          <p>
            She stuttered with emotion. Repenhardt, looking embarrassed, made a
            request.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It’s not just for that… could you perhaps reunite this child with
            her family?”
          </p>
          <p>
            He was pointing at Siris, who stood aloof some distance away.
            Shailen looked at her sister anew, wondering how she had come to
            meet someone who cared so deeply for her.
          </p>
          <p>Interpreting her gaze as wary, Repenhardt quickly added,</p>
          <p>
            “She is not my slave. She never was, and she is not now. There’s no
            risk of her revealing the location of your village to humans.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Shailen had already decided to take Siris back to their tribe.
            Having observed the situation thus far, she couldn’t believe that
            either Repenhardt or Siris would harm them. It was just unnecessary
            worry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then it suddenly occurred to her that Repenhardt had excluded
            himself from his own request.
          </p>
          <p>“Don’t you need to wait for her?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I will wait around here for a while.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt nodded weakly. Shailen smiled broadly.</p>
          <p>“Come with us.”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            “You saved us. It would dishonor our tribe not to repay our
            benefactor.”
          </p>
          <p>GPT</p>
          <p>
            Shailen, having completely opened her heart, surprised Repenhardt
            with her words.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Is it really alright to reveal the location of our hideout to
            someone else?”
          </p>

          <p>“You can be trusted,” she replied calmly.</p>
          <p>
            At Shailen’s response, Repenhardt clicked his tongue. How could she
            not have any sense of caution? Her indifference raised questions for
            him, but Shailen shook her head.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If I bring that child along, it wouldn’t make any difference than
            bringing you.”
          </p>
          <p>
            If Repenhardt had been pretending to be a slave to discover the
            location of the elf village, whether he took both or only Siris, the
            hideout would be compromised either way. Since he had permitted
            Siris, there was no reason Repenhardt couldn’t accompany her.
          </p>
          <p>
            “And even if both of you refuse, you would find our hideout soon
            enough anyway.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Spelrat Desert was a land too harsh for people to inhabit. The
            places where one could live were severely limited. While outsiders
            might not know, Siris had spent her childhood here. With a bit of
            memory, she could easily recall a location the Dahnhaim tribe might
            use as a hideout. After all, there weren’t many places where elves
            could hide.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt nodded, convinced by the explanation.</p>
          <p>“That’s a rational way of thinking.”</p>
          <p>“Elves are always rational.”</p>
          <p>
            Humans were still not trustworthy, but given the circumstances,
            Shailen concluded that Repenhardt and Siris could be trusted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elves, unlike humans, are driven by logical decisions rather than
            emotions. It wasn’t strange for Shailen to come to such a conclusion
            after assessing the situation.
          </p>
          <p>“Then we should get ready.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt raised his right hand, gathering the camels. Using a
            light mind control spell, ten camels lined up naturally, following
            his gestures as if led by a trainer. The children gawked in
            amazement around Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“Let’s go, Raiden, Netina.”</p>
          <p>
            Shailen called the children and helped them onto the camels. The
            camels started moving slowly. The elf children cheered, riding a
            camel for the first time in their lives. After ensuring the children
            were secure, Shailen slowly approached Siris, who was walking
            silently in the middle of the column.
          </p>
          <p>“Serendi…”</p>
          <p>“Are you finally acknowledging me?”</p>
          <p>Shailen soothed her with a slightly hurt voice.</p>
          <p>
            “You would have done the same if you were in my position, right?”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris smiled faintly and nodded. Shailen apologized again and
            glanced back furtively. She murmured in awe, “I’ve met a good
            human.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Yes,” Siris replied instantly. Despite the complexities of their
            situation, she could not deny that meeting Repenhardt had been
            fortunate.
          </p>
          <p>“He truly is a good person,” she added.</p>

          <p>“Yes…” Shailen nodded understandingly.</p>
          <p>“You even told him your name.”</p>
          <p>“What?” Siris looked at Shailen, puzzled. Shailen shrugged.</p>
          <p>“Didn’t you? He called you by your real name earlier.”</p>
          <p>
            “Ah…” Siris’s face stiffened. The conversation they had just had, a
            detail she hadn’t noticed, came to mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt had said it clearly: “Do as you wish, Siris, no, Serendi
            El Areliana.”
          </p>
          <p>
            He had clearly stated it, her real name, one she herself had
            forgotten and thus would never have mentioned.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘How is this possible…’ Her mind was a whirl of confusion. Seeing
            her dazed expression, Shailen looked concerned.
          </p>
          <p>“Eh? What’s wrong, Serendi?”</p>
          <p>
            “No, it’s nothing.” Siris shook her head and looked away. It was an
            explanation she herself couldn’t fathom and did not wish to discuss
            with Shailen. She glanced back to see Repenhardt trudging a short
            distance behind. She desperately wanted to run up and demand an
            explanation, but…
          </p>
          <p>‘He probably won’t answer me anyway…’</p>
          <p>
            After their recent argument, she wasn’t in the mood to start another
            conversation. Siris buried her questions in her heart and continued
            walking. The caravan of camels slowly crossed the desert, heading
            west.
          </p>
          <p>
            In a vast gorge about 15 kilometers from the village of Gehallen,
            deep among the sprawling wastelands, the Danhaim clan was hiding.
            This barren gorge, a scar in the earth where life was hard to find,
            was where they concealed themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fifty years after a massive slave raid that decimated their people,
            the clan realized the necessity of a refuge to avoid repeating such
            nightmares, thus setting up a hiding place within this gorge.
          </p>
          <p>
            The steep cliffs on either side of the gorge held tents made of
            animal hides and dried grass. Defensive positions constructed of
            sparkling bricks, made from melted sand into glassy bricks, lined
            hidden paths. All of these were camouflaged so well they were nearly
            undetectable unless examined closely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Seen from afar, the gorge, constructed of crumbly sandstone and
            featuring steep cliffs, was entirely impenetrable and truly a
            fortress of trials. Indeed, if conditions had permitted, the village
            might have been relocated to this location.
          </p>
          <p>The reason they could not was simple.</p>
          <p>“The water is running out, Elder Relhardt.”</p>
          <p>
            In a crude tent made of animal hides and coarse straw, a
            platinum-haired young elf was making a troubled face towards an
            older elf. The elder, Relhardt, closed his eyes and nodded.
          </p>
          <p>“That would be so.”</p>
          <p>
            Relhardt, who was three hundred and forty-three years old, was the
            oldest and the leader of the Dahnhaim clan. Even by elven standards
            of longevity, he was considered aged, but he appeared to be in his
            early forties by human standards.
          </p>
          <p>
            Humans, who age visibly, would marvel at Relhardt’s maintained
            youthful appearance. However, for elves, who retain their young
            appearance until death, the concept of being elderly doesn’t really
            exist. That an elf has aged to appear middle-aged is a stark
            indication of the difficulties faced living in this harsh
            wilderness.
          </p>
          <p>Relhardt sighed and asked the elf before him.</p>
          <p>“How long can we last with the remaining water?”</p>
          <p>“We could stretch it to a day at most if we conserve it.”</p>
          <p>
            This was precisely why the gorge was nothing more than a hideout.
          </p>
          <p>There was no water here.</p>
          <p>
            Of course, the Dahnhaim clan had built a water reservoir. The desert
            does not lack rain all year round; it occasionally experiences
            fierce downpours. Known as sudden heavy rains, the problem is that
            such events are rare, and the arid desert cannot retain moisture
            unless it’s stored separately.
          </p>
          <p>
            While the stored water was not sufficient for agriculture, it was
            enough to quench the thirst of those hiding in the refuge. However,
            the water had become considerably contaminated over time. Even if
            the sand of the desert filtered it and it received the blessing of
            spirits, it could only be purified enough for drinking. Yet, that
            would suffice for about two hundred people for a week, and that was
            just for drinking. It was nowhere near enough to sustain everyday
            life.

          <p>[ Chapter 96 ]</p>
          <p>“Have the scouts sent ahead returned?”</p>
          <p>
            “Yes, from their thorough investigation, it appears that the humans
            have given up their search and turned back.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A deeper furrow of anguish formed on Relhard’s brow as he asked
            again.
          </p>
          <p>“Have the bodies of the tribe’s warriors been recovered?”</p>
          <p>
            Those noble warriors who stayed in the village to ensure their
            tribe’s escape, sacrificing their lives, could not be left as fodder
            for beasts. The young elf nodded solemnly.
          </p>
          <p>“They all rest under the sands of the desert.”</p>
          <p>
            “May Raguel, the spirit of fire, gather their souls and cradle them
            in the embrace of spirits.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Murmuring the name of Raguel, Relhard prayed for the departed
            warriors’ spirits and pondered.
          </p>
          <p>“So, are we safe for now…?”</p>
          <p>
            “We cannot stay here any longer. If we are to have the strength to
            return to the village, we are at our limit with water.”
          </p>
          <p>
            To return to the village from here, they would have to cross the
            great Yusa River—a perilous journey, especially for the children.
            Delaying could mean more deaths among the children.
          </p>
          <p>Eventually, Relhard consented.</p>
          <p>
            “Tonight, as the sun begins to set, prepare to return. Inform
            everyone to ready themselves.”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes, Elder.”</p>
          <p>
            The young elf bowed his head and left the tent. Relhard looked up,
            troubled.
          </p>
          <p>‘What should we do?’</p>
          <p>
            ‘It’s not possible to live forever in the original village once its
            location is discovered…’
          </p>
          <p>
            Fifty years after the village’s location was revealed, they had
            already faced numerous attacks by slave hunters. While their usual
            evacuation drills and hiding spots prevented a scenario of total
            annihilation, each time they lost more of their precious women and
            children.
          </p>
          <p>
            Something needed to be done. Continuing to live in a known location
            was nothing short of suicidal.
          </p>
          <p>‘But there’s nowhere else suitable to live.’</p>
          <p>
            It wasn’t that the Spelrat Desert, hosting the oasis of the Dahnhaim
            clan, was the only habitable place, but any remotely livable oasis
            was already occupied by human nomads. Nor could they move deeper
            into the desert. Further west, in the depths of the Spelrat Desert,
            there were oases, but inhabited by formidable monsters that the
            Dahnhaim clan couldn’t possibly face. Even now, only half of their
            children reached adulthood; moving to more remote regions would only
            lead to a gradual death of the Dahnhaim clan without human attacks.
          </p>
          <p>
            This hideout was the Dahnhaim clan’s final limit. To retreat further
            would make survival impossible. Yet, there seemed no other way.
          </p>
          <p>“Eldia, grant us a path…”</p>
          <p>
            Calling upon the name of Eldia, the goddess of the elves, Relhard
            lamented. Of course, Eldia did not respond. Having lost the World
            Tree, Elvenheim, Eldia could no longer offer any help to her
            children.
          </p>

          <p>Just then, the elderly elf, Relhard, sighed deeply.</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>Relhard perked up his sharp ears. Something was amiss outside.</p>
          <p>Suddenly, his expression turned grim.</p>
          <p>“Could it be!”</p>
          <p>
            Had the humans discovered the location of this hideout too? Alarmed,
            he grabbed the sword beside him and dashed out of the tent at a
            fearsome speed.
          </p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            At the entrance to the gorge, overlooking the wilderness on that
            narrow hillock, dozens of elves were already stationed, armed and
            waiting. In the desert, metal was a precious commodity, so only
            about a dozen elves wielded iron swords, while the majority were
            armed with weapons made from the bones of beasts—either bone-made
            swords or spears.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once proud and elegant, the high elves now clad themselves in animal
            hides and wielded bones as weapons—an observer from the old times
            would have found this sight deeply lamentable. Of course, no one
            alive could remember those distant days.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relhard sprinted along the narrow path to the entrance of the gorge
            and paused, looking down with a momentary expression of confusion.
          </p>
          <p>“What in the world?”</p>
          <p>
            Below in the wilderness, a group was leading a procession of ten
            camels. At the forefront was a woman with unmistakable platinum
            hair, brown skin, and pointed ears—a member of his own kin.
            Moreover, two children were riding the camels. These were all people
            Relhard knew well.
          </p>
          <p>“Shailen? And Netina and Raiden too?”</p>
          <p>
            Were they really alive? If that were the only news, it wouldn’t have
            caused such a commotion. No, a commotion would have indeed
            occurred—a joyful one to welcome back lost kin.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, following them was clearly an elf girl who appeared to be a
            slave to humans, and a human youth who was unusually large for his
            kind. It was no wonder the other elves were bewildered. It was hard
            to guess why such a situation had occurred.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Relhard looked on perplexed, Shailen moved toward him with a
            bright smile.
          </p>
          <p>“Lord Relhard!”</p>
          <p>At that moment, one of the gorge’s elves shouted angrily.</p>
          <p>“Stay back!”</p>
          <p>
            Simultaneously, a few elves began swinging slings made of animal
            hide.
          </p>
          <p>Whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            Something repeatedly flew and landed near Shailen. It was clear from
            the considerable distance that it was meant as a threat, not an aim.
            Hence, Siris, while adopting a defensive stance, did not immediately
            retaliate. She wasn’t particularly offended. Honestly, she would
            have been disappointed if they hadn’t been cautious.
          </p>
          <p>
            Looking down at the projectile that had landed near her, Siris
            tilted her head in confusion. She had thought they were merely
            throwing stones with their slings…
          </p>
          <p>“Neither metal nor stone…”</p>
          <p>
            The projectile lacked the distinctive sheen of metal and was too
            smooth and oddly translucent to be a stone. Repenhardt approached
            quietly and resolved her curiosity.
          </p>

          <p>
            “They’ve made sling bullets from melted sand, turned into glass.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah…”</p>
          <p>
            Seeing the object in question, Siris remarked on its resemblance to
            a marble. However, it was not round nor clear, but rather a
            semi-melted and tarnished bead, which was why he hadn’t recognized
            it initially.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Well, it’s just meant to be thrown and hit something, so it doesn’t
            matter if it’s a bit rough.”
          </p>
          <p>
            After a moment of awkward silence, Siris cautiously posed a
            question.
          </p>
          <p>“Do we have the means to melt sand here, to achieve such heat?”</p>
          <p>
            Although they had been avoiding conversation due to the discomfort
            following their previous altercation, Siris felt compelled not to
            ignore Repenhardt any longer. Once he broached the subject, he felt
            a sense of relief. Repenhardt, looking more at ease, replied,
          </p>
          <p>“They must have used elemental magic.”</p>
          <p>
            Elves are usually most proficient in air and water elemental magic.
            However, despite being high elves, the Dahnhaim clan, having lived
            for centuries in the arid deserts, excelled in fire elemental magic
            due to the desert heat.
          </p>
          <p>
            “We probably can’t summon spirits powerful enough for battle without
            the World Tree…”
          </p>
          <p>
            While they could gradually increase the firepower after forming a
            fire spirit, achieving instantaneous high firepower was another
            matter, Repenhardt continued to explain.
          </p>
          <p>
            “If that were possible, wouldn’t they all be wielding balls of fire?
            And they wouldn’t have been caught by mere slave hunters either.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris nodded, newly appreciating the seemingly simple-minded young
            man’s unexpected depth of knowledge about his own clan.
          </p>
          <p>
            As admiration shone in Siris’s eyes, Repenhardt, buoyed by the
            recognition, began to chatter about even unasked topics.
          </p>
          <p>
            “The tanned shade of your clan’s skin is for the same reason. Truly,
            even if someone was darkened by the harsh desert sun, returning to
            their original skin color after nearly fifty years away would be
            expected. The fact it hasn’t changed suggests that the Dahnhaim clan
            has been significantly assimilated with the power of fire spirits
            for centuries, stabilizing even their skin color. It means you too
            are assimilated with the power of the fire spirits.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris furrowed his brow. There’s being knowledgeable, and then
            there’s this. It was all becoming suspiciously detailed.
          </p>
          <p>“…You didn’t hear all this from a master, did you?”</p>
          <p>
            Considering the ruins were one thing, but his depth of knowledge
            about elves and other races was peculiar. Indeed, Repenhardt had
            been an anomaly from the start, well-versed in the languages of
            orcs, dwarves, and now even elves, skills seemingly unrelated to his
            claimed expertise in exploring ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            Catching himself, Repenhardt made a face as if he realized
            something.
          </p>
          <p>“Oh, that is…”</p>
          <p>
            Ah, Siris seemed quite pleased to have someone to talk to, and
            Repenhardt had perhaps spilled too much in his excitement.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Oh, our master’s friend is also knowledgeable about elves and
            dwarves… I’ve picked up a thing or two just from overhearing,”
            Repenhardt stammered, as if offering an excuse. Siris’s eyes
            sparkled with curiosity.
          </p>
          <p>“Then how did you know my name?”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>“Serendi El Areliana. That’s my elven name.”</p>

          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Repenhardt’s complexion turned pale as he realized the
            mistake he had made.
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris continued to gaze at Repenhardt sharply, her eyes full of
            suspicion. Sweat poured down Repenhardt’s back. This was truly a
            grave error; there was no room for excuses!
          </p>
          <p>“Umm…”</p>
          <p>
            Groaning, Repenhardt tried to avoid Siris’s distrustful stare. He
            had always sensed her suspicions about him. The situation was only
            going to get worse, not better. Honestly, keeping secrets was
            becoming increasingly difficult.
          </p>
          <p>‘But how should I even begin to explain?’</p>
          <p>
            It seemed he would need to return to Grand Forge and seek advice
            from Makelin about this issue. Resolving to do so, Repenhardt softly
            tried to appease Siris.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I’ll explain everything properly later. This situation is a bit…
            you know?”
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, the elves were still watching them with a mix of hostility
            and curiosity. Now was not the time for leisurely discussions. Siris
            nodded and turned her gaze back toward the gorge.
          </p>
          <p>‘First, I need to show that I mean no harm…’</p>
          <p>Repenhardt raised his hands and stepped forward.</p>
          <p>“Elves!”</p>
          <p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh!</p>
          <p>
            Just like at Grand Forge, the conversation was preempted by the
            arrival of glass bullets. Of course, it was hardly a challenge for
            Repenhardt, who could easily deflect even metal-tipped arrows.
          </p>
          <p>Thump! Thud!</p>
          <p>
            As the slingshot-fired glass bullets bounced off harmlessly, the
            elves began to show signs of confusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt cleared his throat briefly and then raised his voice
            loudly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Descendants of the great spirits, though I am human, I am not your
            enemy! As one who knows the history of the elves, I seek to show you
            a gesture of friendship!”
          </p>
          <p>
            His words were clear in the Elvish tongue. The elves looked at
            Repenhardt, bewildered.
          </p>
          <p>“What’s going on?”</p>
          <p>“Elder Relhard?”</p>
          <p>
            Relhard himself seemed utterly perplexed. The accuracy of the Elvish
            language was one thing, but the content of the speech was profoundly
            rooted in the etiquette of the elves—a decorum almost lost even
            among the elves themselves, let alone to be spoken by a human.
          </p>
          <p>‘…Is he not an enemy?’</p>
          <p>
            Relhard felt puzzled as he alternately looked at Shailen and two
            children riding a camel. Logically, the scene suggested that these
            people had rescued his tribe and brought them here. If they were not
            humans, there would be no reason to doubt them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relhard raised his right hand, and the elves slowly lowered their
            slings. As the attack ceased, Repenhardt smiled gently—a smile so
            filled with goodwill that it bore no trace of hostility. Relhard was
            even more confused by this emotion.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s clear that he bears goodwill…’</p>
          <p>
            Yet, the possibility of a trap could not be entirely dismissed.
            Humans were creatures capable of maintaining a calm exterior while
            potentially ready to strike treacherously. Though the attack had
            been halted, it didn’t mean they could blindly trust the newcomer.
          </p>
          <p>Relhard shouted,</p>
          <p>
            “Your words sound plausible! But there is insufficient evidence to
            trust you!”
          </p>
          <p>‘Well, that figures.’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt nodded as if he had expected this response. Dwarves could
            be swayed by a few words of truth, gaining immediate trust. But
            elves were different.

          <p>[ Chapter 97 ]</p>
          <p>
            But Repenhardt already knew how to earn the elves’ trust. It was the
            same situation when he first met them in his previous life.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I understand perfectly! Henceforth, I will show you the basis!”
          </p>
          <p>
            After shouting in Elvish, Repenhardt slightly bent his knees. Then,
            he drew up the aura from his entire body.
          </p>
          <p>Whooosh!</p>
          <p>
            Golden aura burst forth like flames. The elves, already sensitive to
            energy, were startled by the sudden surge of intense destructive
            power and switched to a defensive posture.
          </p>
          <p>“Ugh?”</p>
          <p>“Gasp!”</p>
          <p>
            In that state, Repenhardt suddenly looked up at the sky and
            delivered a powerful strike into the air.
          </p>
          <p>“Calamity Soul!”</p>
          <p>
            A dazzling golden light pierced through the desert sky. The pillar
            of light pushed against the atmosphere, dispersing tremendous energy
            in all directions. The atmosphere vibrated, and ripples spread,
            clearly marking their trail on the sand.
          </p>
          <p>Crash!</p>
          <p>
            With a thunderous noise, the pillar of light pierced through the
            desert sky. The immense power altered the expressions of the elves.
            Relhard murmured in astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>“…An aura user?”</p>
          <p>
            The opponent was an aura wielder! Among the chosen superhumans, a
            solitary figure equivalent to an army in might! Moreover, the
            tremendous energy showed that not even the entire Dahnhaim clan
            could inflict a scratch on him!
          </p>
          <p>Rumble!</p>
          <p>
            As the Calamity Soul pierced the sky and shook the atmosphere with a
            loud noise, it vanished. Repenhardt pulled back his fist. Standing
            by his side, Siris turned pale and questioned him.
          </p>
          <p>“What are you doing!”</p>
          <p>
            This seemed like an act of provocation. Peaceful approaches were
            insufficient, yet he demonstrated brute force! Siris’s criticism was
            met with Repenhardt’s broad smile. She was visibly nervous,
            continually glancing at her kin.
          </p>
          <p>“Humans would certainly perceive this as a threat…”</p>
          <p>
            Clearly, Siris had spent too long among humans. Her way of thinking
            was uncharacteristic of an ‘elf’.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt subtly pointed towards the elves. Siris unwittingly
            followed his gaze, and was startled. The elves, previously full of
            hostility, were now looking at them with faces filled with goodwill.
          </p>
          <p>“…Eh?”</p>
          <p>
            Relhard sheathed his sword at his waist and shouted with a bright
            voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            “With someone of your strength, there’s no need for traps! We
            understand that you have approached us with genuine goodwill!”
          </p>
          <p>“Elves think rationally, you see?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt shrugged as if to say, ‘See what I mean?’ Originally, in
            his past life, he had asserted his presence by demonstrating
            powerful magic, but displaying his aura abilities now would lead to
            no different an outcome.
          </p>
          <p>Siris muttered as if she couldn’t believe it.</p>

          <p>“No, even so, to just blindly trust like this…”</p>
          <p>
            Even if Repenhardt was an aura master capable of confronting the
            entire Dahnhaim tribe, it wasn’t entirely impossible to consider
            traps. Couldn’t the slave hunters also muster enough strength to
            confront the entire tribe? What if Repenhardt had deliberately let
            his guard down to allow the elves to escape, then secretly called
            his comrades to ambush them from all sides?
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the elves had already completely dispelled their doubts
            about Repenhardt, relaxing their defensive posture and descending
            into the canyon to meet them. Siris shook her head.
          </p>
          <p>“Logically, shouldn’t we have more doubts about this?”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt whispered in response to her query.</p>
          <p>“Huh? I didn’t trust him for that reason.”</p>
          <p>“Then why?”</p>
          <p>
            “It’s a bit embarrassing to say out loud, but you know, I’m an aura
            master, right? And quite a strong one at that.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            “Why would I come all this way to this remote area and bother with
            the tiresome task of capturing wild elves to sell? There are much
            easier ways for an aura master to make money.”
          </p>
          <p>“Ah?”</p>
          <p>
            That made sense. A powerhouse like Repenhardt wouldn’t bother coming
            to this annoying desert just to catch some wild elves. An aura
            master could be treated well anywhere. Take Lantas, for instance,
            who committed atrocious crimes yet still lived comfortably without
            worry. Have you ever seen an aura master or a great sorcerer
            leveling a village just for some quick cash?
          </p>
          <p>
            At least, the possibility of a great mage or aura master coming to
            this remote place just for money was extremely unlikely. This was
            the reason, both in past and present lives, that they had resolved
            their doubts about Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“That makes sense…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris admired as she watched her approaching tribe members. Even in
            such a brief moment, and under these pressing circumstances, how
            could they maintain such clear rationality?
          </p>
          <p>
            A proud pride filled her chest. Despite the harsh conditions, the
            Dahnhaim tribe had never lost their elven wisdom. They were still a
            tribe to be proud of. That fact was almost overwhelmingly joyful…
          </p>
          <p>“Thank you sincerely for saving our children.”</p>
          <p>
            Relhard, coming closer, placed his right hand on his shoulder and
            bowed his head. It was a gesture of sincere gratitude in elven
            etiquette. Repenhardt reciprocated by placing his left hand on his
            shoulder, a gesture of humility in elven custom.
          </p>
          <p>“Not at all, the true thanks should go to someone else.”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt pointed at Siris.</p>
          <p>“She is the one who truly saved them.”</p>
          <p>
            Relhard nodded and this time, expressed his gratitude towards Siris.
            Siris was taken aback. She did not know the etiquette of the elves
            as Repenhardt did. Eventually, she shrugged her shoulders and waved
            her hands ‘like a human’.
          </p>
          <p>“No, no. It was surely Repenhardt who took care of most of it…”</p>
          <p>
            While replying, Siris sighed inwardly. It was embarrassing for her,
            an elf, not to follow the elven customs even though humans did.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, Relhard carefully observed Siris and continued
            speaking.
          </p>
          <p>“But the energy in that hair and skin seems somehow familiar.”</p>
          <p>Shailen joined the conversation.</p>
          <p>“It’s Serendi, Relhard.”</p>

          <p>“Hmm?”</p>
          <p>Approaching Siris, Shailen spoke in a gentle voice.</p>
          <p>“The daughter of Areliana and Piana, Serendi. Do you remember?”</p>
          <p>
            Relhard’s eyes widened in shock. As the leader of his clan, he
            remembered every member who had been born and died. As soon as he
            heard the name, memories from the past clearly resurfaced in his
            mind.
          </p>
          <p>“A child lost during the Day of Nightmares!”</p>
          <p>
            Other elves began murmuring and looking towards Siris. No elf was
            unaware of the Night of Nightmares, the dreadful day when the
            Dahnhaim clan nearly perished.
          </p>
          <p>
            An uproar ensued. Voices of surprise and welcome filled the air,
            along with words of thanks to Eldia for the miracle of a child
            thought to have been sold into slavery returning.
          </p>
          <p>Relhard shook his head in amazement.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, it is indeed a joy, not only to have found a family member we
            thought was lost but also to have an old family member return. Such
            a noble cannot continue to stand in such a place; would you come
            inside? We have a humble space where you can stretch your legs.”
          </p>
          <p>“It would be an honor.”</p>
          <p>
            Upon Relhard’s invitation, Repenhardt nodded politely. Accompanied
            by Repenhardt’s party, the elves began moving between the canyons.
          </p>
          <p>
            That evening, the elves returned to their village, Delru Eldel.
            Repenhardt and Siris also left the canyon following them. Upon
            arriving at the village, the Dahnhaim clan conducted a ceremony. It
            was a ritual of thanks to the goddess, Eldia, for safely overcoming
            another ordeal.
          </p>
          <p>
            A large flame, created using fire elemental magic, blazed without
            logs on the sands of the desert. Around this fire, a beautiful elf
            woman sang.
          </p>
          <p>“Rachel Riand Elrin’s Pirana…”</p>
          <p>
            It was the elves’ long-transmitted dirge, a ritual of remembrance
            for the warriors who had died protecting their clan. The celebration
            that followed welcomed back the clan members who had returned alive.
            Everyone danced and sang around the fire, celebrating for Shailen
            and her two children, and for Siris, who had returned after 50
            years.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the midst of the desert, the air began to fill with the lively
            sound of singing. Everyone looked joyful. Having returned to the
            village, they were now able to drink water abundantly and had plenty
            of food. Though the Dahnhaim tribe usually struggled with food
            supply, they now had as many as ten camels. Relhard had made up his
            mind to butcher four of them, and thanks to this, fresh camel meat
            sizzled and dripped fat as it cooked over the village fires.
          </p>
          <p>Standing by a tent, Repenhardt cracked a bitter smile.</p>
          <p>
            ‘The sight of elves frolicking before a roast makes me feel
            strangely ambivalent…’
          </p>
          <p>
            In ancient tales, the feasts of elves were always described as
            mysterious and marvelous events. Compared to the legends of old
            elves, who mingled with various animals in verdant forests and
            indulged in clear spirits and fresh fruits with their noble
            demeanor, the current scene could almost be considered decadent.
          </p>
          <p>Yet, they were still beautiful.</p>
          <p>
            They were neither as mystical nor as marvelous as the elves of
            legend, but this did not diminish their beauty. Even in a primitive
            life, their elegant grace reminiscent of the old elves remained.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, they had not changed, then or now. Adapting to nature,
            blending in, and living in harmony, whether in lush forests or
            barren deserts, their lives remained consistent.
          </p>
          <p>The elves were still mysterious and wondrous.</p>
          <p>Pleased by this realization, Repenhardt smiled broadly.</p>
          <p>“Rel Dryd Shalahna…”</p>
          <p>
            Savoring the tickling melodies of elfish songs, he watched the
            village scene. Adults reveling, young elf children bustling among
            them. The children were busy grabbing various meats, dried fruits,
            and nuts placed around the fire pits.
          </p>
          <p>“Sweet!”</p>
          <p>“Tasty! Nutty!”</p>

          <p>“Try one too, Eiri.”</p>
          <p>
            Watching the boisterous children, Repenhardt thought to himself.
          </p>
          <p>‘Bringing the camels was a good move.’</p>
          <p>
            These were originally part of the provisions Bright’s group had
            prepared for crossing the desert. The ten camels Repenhardt had
            brought were laden with food and supplies sufficient for more than
            forty people. To the children, who were always used to rough meals,
            even these stored rations were a feast.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elsewhere, Siris was reconnecting with friends from her memories.
          </p>
          <p>“I’m so happy you’re back, Serendi! Do you remember me?”</p>
          <p>“…Jerain? Is that you, Jerain?”</p>
          <p>“You remember! What about me?”</p>
          <p>
            At first, it seemed awkward, but as everyone greeted her warmly,
            Siris, too, began to smile more and more. Repenhardt looked at her
            with a complex expression.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s good to see, Siris…’</p>
          <p>Seeing her happy made him happy as well.</p>
          <p>
            However, he could not purely enjoy this happiness, for Repenhardt’s
            sorrow lay in the fact that the happier she was, the less likely she
            was to stay by his side. The more the Dahnhaim clan welcomed her,
            the less likely she was to remain with him.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Will Siris, who is enjoying herself so much, really follow me?’
          </p>
          <p>
            Doubts grew stronger. Perhaps he should have persuaded her more
            forcefully? But then, he would never win Siris’s heart for a
            lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            After all, he had no choice. What he wanted was Siris as his beloved
            partner, not an elf slave to satisfy his lust.
          </p>
          <p>Then there was only one conclusion.</p>
          <p>He could only hope that she would choose him.</p>
          <p>A sigh inadvertently escaped him.</p>
          <p>“Hoo…”</p>
          <p>
            At that, Relhard approached Repenhardt with a puzzled expression.
          </p>
          <p>“It seems you are not in good spirits, my benefactor?”</p>
          <p>“No, it’s nothing.”</p>
          <p>
            Quickly managing his expression, Repenhardt shook his head and then
            stared pointedly at Relhard, clicking his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>‘This gentleman really hasn’t changed a bit.’</p>
          <p>
            It was the same with Makelin, but Relhard should have been met much
            later in the original course of destiny. Yet, curiously, his
            appearance hadn’t changed from his memory at all.
          </p>
          <p>‘That’s why the long-lived ones…’</p>
          <p>
            This was why humans, while disparaging elves and dwarves, also
            envied them. As he grumbled inwardly, Relhard made an embarrassed
            face.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Thank you once again for your help. Naturally, I should repay you
            somehow, but given the circumstances…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Living in such deprivation, there really was no way to repay him.
            Even this feast was made possible by the camel and food Repenhardt
            had provided.
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt waved his hand dismissively.</p>
          <p>“There’s absolutely no need to worry about it.”</p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, his gaze drifted to Siris, who was now far off, sitting
            next to Shailen by the bonfire, engaging in a quiet conversation.
            Every so often, Siris burst into laughter at some amusing story, a
            stark contrast to her usual stoic and expressionless demeanor.
          </p>
          <p>“Just seeing that laughter is reward enough for me.”</p>

          <p>[ Chapter 98 ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked at her with a wistful gaze and replied. Relhard
            firmly denied in a soft voice, “No, that laughter is precisely what
            we should be paying for.”
          </p>
          <p>
            For a moment, the two silently watched the joyous feast of the
            elves. Suddenly, Relhard asked, “Is this child to remain here?”
          </p>
          <p>
            “That is for Siris, or rather Serendi, to decide. It’s not my place
            to say,” Repenhardt responded.
          </p>
          <p>“Weren’t you here to send the child back?”</p>
          <p>
            “Rather than that… I just wanted to give her a chance to meet her
            family…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt scratched his head awkwardly, unable to confess that it
            was actually a move to score some points. He subtly changed the
            subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Actually, there’s another purpose. I wanted her to experience the
            unique power of the elves.”
          </p>
          <p>Relhard nodded in understanding. “You mean the art of spirits.”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Just as dwarves’ techniques are impossible for humans to master, so
            too are the elves’ spirit arts unattainable for humans. Although
            Repenhardt had deeply studied the elves’ spirit arts in his past
            life and reached a new level of magic, it didn’t mean he could
            practice spirit magic himself. Understanding the concept of spirit
            arts and incorporating it into magic was possible, but using or
            teaching the spirit arts themselves was not.
          </p>
          <p>“I can handle the power of spirits a little myself…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt quietly chanted a summoning spell. A small fire sprite
            formed in his palm and began to dance.
          </p>
          <p>“…you handle it much better than I do.”</p>
          <p>
            Relhard clicked his tongue. He had heard from Shailen that he was a
            magician, but seeing it with his own eyes was still surprising.
            Being a high mage, despite being an aura user, was an illogical
            situation even for a rational elf.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt retracted the fire spirit and muttered, “This is merely
            magical summoning. It’s entirely different from the elves’ spirit
            arts. Only your people can teach Siris.”
          </p>
          <p>
            “Of course, it’s not only our duty but a natural obligation to teach
            Serendi the spirit arts since our tribe’s teachings are open.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Relhard closed his eyes and concentrated deeply. About a
            minute later, flames burst forth from his hand, though they formed
            no clear shape like Repenhardt’s, just simple flames.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relhard made a bitter face. “This is the strongest power our
            Dahnhaim tribe currently possesses. Shamefully…”
          </p>
          <p>The elves who lost the World Tree no longer possess power.</p>
          <p>
            Even Relhard, the most adept at spirit magic among the Dahnhaim
            clan, cannot manifest a fire spirit into the physical world as
            Repenhardt does. At best, he can communicate with the wind spirits
            to discern an enemy’s location or ask the earth spirits to disrupt
            mana detection.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I can maintain and materialize the flames to increase the
            firepower, but…”
          </p>
          <p>
            Relhard set the flames down on the ground and fixed them in the air.
            The flames began to intensify gradually.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is already a great help in the desert. There isn’t even proper
            fuel here.”
          </p>
          <p>
            With a wave of his hand, Relhard extinguished the flames in the air.
            Turning his head back with a tired look, he continued.
          </p>
          <p>
            “However, it’s certainly not sufficient for combat. I’d rather see
            the child learn magic from you…”
          </p>

          <p>
            Relhard trailed off, embarrassed. Being born an elf and having to
            admit such things made his current plight all the more despairing.
            Yet, not speaking the truth would only injure his pride further.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Repenhardt was not unaware of this situation when he mentioned
            it.
          </p>
          <p>“Of course, I’ll teach magic whenever there’s a chance.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, in her past life, was an exceptional magic swordsman. She had
            reached great heights by receiving direct instruction from
            Repenhardt, the most powerful magician, and even using the voice of
            Elucion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Originally, Repenhardt had imparted magical knowledge to the Four
            Heavenly Kings whenever possible. There was no reason not to teach
            his subordinates when he possessed such powerful magic and
            knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, the Troll Guru Attila and the High Priest Makelin, due to
            their abilities, could not directly wield magic but only received
            knowledge and wisdom. Tassid, being quite dense, couldn’t grasp the
            concepts, so after a few attempts, Repenhardt gave up on him, making
            Siris his only real disciple.
          </p>
          <p>‘It’s about time I started teaching Siris magic, isn’t it?’</p>
          <p>
            Until now, Repenhardt had been too busy advancing his own realm to
            spare the time to teach Siris. Moreover, magic requires showing the
            actual casting and a mentor guiding the mana to properly establish
            the foundation. Without this, teaching just the theory and
            neglecting practice can lead to bad habits that make advancing
            increasingly difficult.
          </p>
          <p>‘Half-learning is worse than not learning at all.’</p>
          <p>
            So, while Repenhardt intended to teach Siris magic, spirit magic was
            a different story. It wasn’t just about having an additional method
            for combat…
          </p>
          <p>
            “Isn’t it terribly sad that elves cannot even converse with
            spirits?” Relhard asked, his eyes wide with surprise as he gazed at
            Repenhardt.
          </p>
          <p>“You seem to truly understand our kind.”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked back at the village scenery without any reply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Realizing the gravity of his duties as the elder of his tribe,
            Relhard began to make preparations to leave; it wasn’t the time for
            leisurely chats.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as he was about to step away, Relhard turned back, adding, “If
            that child wishes to stay here, and if you do not wish to part with
            them, the Dahnhaim tribe would be more than willing to accept you.
            Your kindness has exceeded any level we could simply repay, so now
            you are a brother to us.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This was a significant offer, especially from the typically guarded
            elves. Repenhardt nodded in sincere gratitude.
          </p>
          <p>“I appreciate your kindness.”</p>
          <p>
            Yet, it wasn’t feasible for him. He had duties to fulfill and
            destinies to conclude.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Enjoy the feast then,” said Relhard as he walked towards the other
            side of the village. Repenhardt watched him go, his gaze solemn,
            then turned back to the festivities. The flickering lights and the
            gently smiling faces of the elves cast a complex array of emotions
            over Repenhardt’s brown eyes.
          </p>
          <p>The night deepened.</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt stayed in Delru Eldel for three days, a period intended
            for Siris to make up her mind. However, she still seemed undecided.
          </p>
          <p>
            Interacting with other elves, assisting them with their tasks, and
            learning about their culture and traditions kept Siris busy, and
            Repenhardt, with the patience typical of someone his age, merely
            observed quietly.
          </p>
          <p>
            On the morning of the third day, Repenhardt emerged from the tent
            that had been provided for him, quickly eating the camel meat and
            dried fruits prepared for breakfast before stepping outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            The village was bustling as usual in the early morning, with elves
            busily rebuilding their homes. Beyond, at the edge of the oasis, a
            girl and a woman sat hunched over, talking. It was Siris and
            Shailen.
          </p>
          <p>
            “This is how it is done. Do you understand, Serendi?” Shailen
            continued gently.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I’m still not sure,” replied Siris, who was learning the basic
            emotional empathy technique of spirit magic from Shailen. Their
            palms touching, Shailen continued kindly, “Once you master it,
            you’ll be able to empathize with the spirits of wind or water.
            Connecting with their emotions is the first step in communicating
            with spirits.”
          </p>
          <p>Siris nodded her head and refocused her mind.</p>
          <p>“Uhm, I’m not sure…”</p>
          <p>
            “Just take it calmly, and you’ll manage, Serendi. You heard my voice
            when you saved me, right? Recall that sensation. There’s no need to
            rush.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Shailen encouraged Siris, who was hurrying. After all, it had taken
            her years to feel this empathic connection. It couldn’t possibly be
            sensed in just three days.
          </p>
          <p>“Ah, is this it?”</p>
          <p>“Huh? You’re already sensing it?”</p>
          <p>
            Shailen looked at Siris with surprise. In the early stages of
            learning spirit magic, cultivating empathic power is crucial, akin
            to sensing the flow of magical energy in magic. To master this in
            just three days?
          </p>
          <p>“Mmm… Mmm…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris, sensing something, continued to concentrate with her eyes
            closed. Shailen watched her with astonishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘It’s impossible… It’s just theory, but how can she have such
            affinity with the spirits so quickly?’
          </p>
          <p>
            It was the third day since Shailen had started teaching Siris about
            spirit magic. In such a short time, Siris had already mastered all
            the theories and knowledge of spirit magic, the traditional
            knowledge of spirits among elves, and even the songs to summon them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The teaching pace Shailen observed in Siris was astonishingly fast.
            Normally, elves don’t learn this quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, this was understandable. Since childhood, Siris had been a
            human slave, rigorously trained in various disciplines. Her
            experience as a slave had fostered a ‘human-like’ quick learning
            ability.
          </p>
          <p>
            But awakening to empathic power in just three days was beyond common
            sense. It was almost like the elves from the era when the ‘World
            Tree was still thriving.’
          </p>
          <p>Confused, Shailen hesitantly spoke.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, anyway, you did well. With this skill, even if you follow
            that man, you can continue practicing spirit magic on your own.
            That’s impressive, Serendi.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly, Siris opened her eyes. She looked at Shailen with a
            curious expression and asked,
          </p>
          <p>“Can you also feel human emotions?”</p>
          <p>Shailen made an ambiguous face.</p>
          <p>
            “It’s possible, but don’t mistake it for sincerity. Humans can
            deceive even their emotions depending on the situation.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Spirits are pure beings. Thus, their emotions are pure and there is
            no doubt in their communication. However, humans, even when they are
            sincerely loving someone, can harbor doubt and deceit in a corner of
            their heart. A flirt can express emotions filled with kindness.
            Human emotions are indeed complex and cannot be defined by a single
            term.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Elves have less emotional turmoil, but humans do not. Therefore,
            trying to discern a human’s sincerity based solely on feeling
            emotions is a dangerous endeavor.”
          </p>
          <p>“That’s true…”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            ‘Hmm, it seems that Siris has grasped the basics of spirit magic,’
            Repenhardt noted as he approached the oasis, observing Siris and
            Shailen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Shailen’s expression, marked by surprise, suggested that Siris had
            indeed awakened to her affinity for spirits. Of course, Repenhardt
            was not surprised; Siris had progressed this far in her previous
            life as well. Moreover, he knew the reason why.
          </p>
          <p>“The effect of that is indeed beneficial.”</p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt approached, Shailen discreetly bowed her head and
            left, evidently to give them some privacy. The man and woman stood
            side by side by the lakeside, Repenhardt breaking the silence with a
            hesitant voice.
          </p>
          <p>“Are you enjoying this, Siris?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I am enjoying it.”</p>
          <p>“As expected, with your family…”</p>
          <p>Yet despite her response, her expression did not seem joyful.</p>
          <p>
            “Still worried, huh?” Repenhardt swallowed hard. He had been
            patient, but after about three days, even his aged patience was
            running thin. No matter how enduring an older man’s patience might
            be claimed to be, Repenhardt was still a man. To have held out for
            three days was already quite long.
          </p>
          <p>Finally, Repenhardt asked the question.</p>
          <p>“Do you want to stay with them?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            It was a firm response. His heart sank momentarily. As Repenhardt
            stood dazed, Siris continued to speak.
          </p>
          <p>“I want to stay and help them.”</p>
          <p>
            His legs weakened at her words. Just as Repenhardt staggered, Siris
            continued.
          </p>
          <p>“But even so, will their lives change?”</p>
          <p>“Huh?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt sharply lifted his head, looking directly at Siris who
            faced him with a determined expression.
          </p>
          <p>“If I follow you, can we change their lives?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt swallowed hard, his fingertips trembling. Trying to calm
            his overwhelming emotions, he spoke clearly.
          </p>
          <p>
            “It will change. I swear on my life, it will definitely change.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Siris smiled broadly, giving him the answer he had so longed to
            hear.
          </p>
          <p>“Then I want to follow you. For the future of my tribe.”</p>
          <p>
            ‘And for my heart…’ she added silently to herself, her last words
            unheard by Repenhardt. However, this was enough for him. His eyes
            widened like a bull’s as he grasped Siris’s shoulder, his voice
            trembling.
          </p>
          <p>“…Is it true, Siris?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Her reply was even more resolute. His heart swelled with emotion.
          </p>
          <p>“Ha ha…”</p>
          <p>Repenhardt’s lips curled into a wide smile.</p>
          <p>“Ha ha ha…”</p>
          <p>His laughter soon filled the air.</p>
          <p>“Ha ha ha ha…”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt laughed heartily, more joyously than he had ever
            remembered in both his past and present lives.

          <p>[ Chapter 99 ]</p>
          <p>“Muahahaha!”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt raised his fist and struck the air. Boom! A golden aura
            surged up his forearm and pierced the sky. Within this magnificent
            pillar of brilliant light splitting the heavens, Repenhardt
            reaffirmed his resolve.
          </p>
          <p>Things will change.</p>
          <p>I will definitely change the world.</p>
          <p>For this woman who has chosen me!</p>
          <p>Hummmmm!</p>
          <p>
            The majestic aura of light penetrated the sky and gradually faded
            away. This demonstration of Gym Unbreakable’s unique way of
            expressing his emotions through the exalted realm of martial arts
            was undoubtedly a grand spectacle. The problem was, the only ones
            who really understood it in this world were the followers of Gym
            Unbreakable.
          </p>
          <p>“Kyaaak! What are you doing, Lord Repenhardt!”</p>
          <p>
            Siris covered her ears, shocked. Why would he suddenly strike at the
            innocent sky? The whole village was already stirring, watching his
            eccentric behavior. She scowled and questioned him again.
          </p>
          <p>“Seriously, what are you doing?”</p>
          <p>Only then did Repenhardt click his tongue and lower his hand.</p>
          <p>
            “Well, I guess? I felt so good that I just did it without thinking…”
          </p>
          <p>“Why would you hit the sky if you’re feeling good?”</p>
          <p>“That, that’s a good question?”</p>
          <p>
            As he retracted his aura, Repenhardt looked puzzled. He couldn’t
            quite figure out why he had done it.
          </p>
          <p>‘Gee, why did I do that?’</p>
          <p>
            Shrugging off his confusion, Repenhardt decided there were more
            pressing matters at hand.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris.”</p>
          <p>
            He grabbed her shoulders and looked directly into her eyes with a
            solemn expression.
          </p>
          <p>“I’ll show you. The changing future of our clan. Right now!”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            Half a day later, Repenhardt and Siris stood at the entrance of a
            massive canyon—the very gorge that the Dahnhaim clan used as a
            hideout in times of crisis.
          </p>
          <p>
            Behind them, Relhard, unable to comprehend the situation, asked with
            a puzzled expression, “Benefactor, what business brings us here?”
          </p>
          <p>
            He had been busy with various tasks for the reconstruction of the
            village when suddenly Repenhardt had burst in, dragging him out
            without any explanation. Since it was a request from their
            benefactor, he had to prioritize it over his busy schedule and had
            quietly followed out of the village. He had kept his silence even as
            they crossed the desert.
          </p>

          <p>
            But now that they were here, he could no longer contain his
            curiosity, and it seemed Siris felt the same.
          </p>
          <p>“Why have we returned to this place, Lord Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt turned to Relhard with a slight smile toward Siris and
            declared, “From now on, this place will become the village of the
            Dahnhaim clan.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Relhard furrowed his brow slightly. Had they really wasted half a
            day for such a pointless endeavor?
          </p>
          <p>“It’s futile. There is no water here.”</p>
          <p>
            The Dahnhaim clansmen knew well enough not to settle here
            permanently over their current village due to its geographic
            disadvantages, using it only as a hideout. The essential water was
            nowhere to be found, which is why, with no choice left, they
            couldn’t abandon Delru Eldel after its location had been
            compromised.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just as Relhard was about to explain this, Repenhardt raised his
            hand.
          </p>
          <p>“No more,” he said.</p>
          <p>“What?” Relhard replied, perplexed.</p>
          <p>
            Leaving a bewildered Relhard behind, Repenhardt continued walking
            deeper into the canyon. Relhard and Siris followed, their eyes wide
            with confusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Relhard wondered, ‘What’s this? Could there be an undiscovered water
            vein?’
          </p>
          <p>
            That seemed unlikely. The Dahnhaim clan had lived in the Spelrat
            Desert for centuries. Although Repenhardt was known to be a powerful
            aura user and an accomplished mage, the clan knew far more about the
            desert. They had thoroughly explored this hideout many times. There
            were no water veins.
          </p>
          <p>‘Or perhaps he intends to create a well through magic?’</p>
          <p>
            Relhard knew well that such a feat was impossible. The three
            miracles forbidden to humans—direct intervention in space, time, and
            matter. No magic could turn rock directly into water. Perhaps
            guiding a water vein to produce water could be feasible, but even a
            mage couldn’t create water from nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Repenhardt moved forward without hesitation deep into the canyon,
            passing the secret shelters made by the elves, he led them even
            further into the dry, black-sanded heart of the gorge. It was there
            that Repenhardt finally stopped.
          </p>
          <p>“Lord Repenhardt?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris squinted around, seeing nothing but barren land devoid of any
            sign of a well, growing more puzzled by the moment. Suddenly,
            Repenhardt turned to her with an apologetic look.
          </p>
          <p>“Siris, may I have the Nihillen you received from me?”</p>
          <p>“What?”</p>
          <p>
            Siris looked up at Repenhardt, perplexed. Why would he ask for a
            gift back, especially when the magical bow, Nihillen, was
            particularly cherished by her? Was he regretting the gift?
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the solemnity in Repenhardt’s expression made it clear that
            it was not for any petty reason. Dumbfounded, Siris nodded slowly
            and carefully handed over the Nihillen from her waist—it was just a
            small wooden rod when its power was not invoked. Taking Nihillen,
            Repenhardt suddenly asked,
          </p>
          <p>
            “Siris, you awakened to the spirit affinity in just three days, did
            you not?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yes? Oh, yes.”</p>
          <p>“Weren’t you curious how that was possible?”</p>
          <p>
            Indeed, she was curious. According to Shailen, it took other elves
            at least a year to become sensitive to such energies. It was only
            natural to assume there was something beyond mere talent when she
            had managed what took others years, in just days.
          </p>

          <p>
            “It’s because you were the rightful owner of Nihillen. You were the
            master of the covenant, recognized to call upon its name and wield
            its power.”
          </p>
          <p>“…?”</p>
          <p>
            At Repenhardt’s cryptic words, Siris blinked in confusion.
            Repenhardt then turned and planted Nihillen into the black sand. The
            humble wooden stick stood upright on the sand. He then brought his
            hands together and began chanting a spell.
          </p>
          <p>“El Sereti Daunt Patrad Sel…”</p>
          <p>
            The incantation was incredibly long, and Repenhardt continued with
            intense focus, chanting in the ancient runic language. Siris and
            Relhard watched silently, holding their breaths.
          </p>
          <p>Suddenly, Repenhardt’s chant shifted.</p>
          <p>
            “Awaken. You who are destined to be the guardian, the seed of the
            great tree that sustains the world…”
          </p>
          <p>
            At that moment, both Siris and Relhard felt chills as they stared
            into the air. An eerie energy, invisible yet distinctly palpable,
            was emanating from Nihillen and spreading in all directions. It
            enveloped their heads, filled the canyon, stretched into the sky,
            and burrowed deep into the earth with a transcendent vibration.
          </p>
          <p>“What is this?”</p>
          <p>“This is?”</p>
          <p>
            The world around them was blanketed by the energy emanating from
            Nihillen. Siris rubbed her eyes in disbelief as she watched the form
            of Nihillen transform.
          </p>
          <p>“…Has it sprouted?”</p>
          <p>
            On this parched land devoid of moisture, the object that was merely
            a stick was now sprouting green shoots. The sprout grew rapidly into
            branches as Nihillen itself expanded in size. It thickened and
            lengthened, sprouting shoots and extending branches in all
            directions.
          </p>
          <p>“This can’t be…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris gasped. What stood before them was no longer Nihillen. It had
            become a robust tree, rooting into the earth and fluttering green
            leaves, albeit small compared to Repenhardt’s height, the
            transformation was undeniably astounding. But the astonishments
            didn’t end there.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the base of Nihillen, the ground began to moisten. Gradually
            becoming wetter, it soon burst into a stream of water. The water
            gushed out and flowed over the sand.
          </p>
          <p>It was a spring. A spring had sprung.</p>
          <p>“Good heavens…”</p>
          <p>
            Relhard was aghast, witnessing this ‘miracle’. So astonished was he
            that his pointed ears stood on end, quivering. Repenhardt, this
            enigmatic human, had evidently cultivated verdure on this barren
            land. This was no mere magic. It was truly a divine feat!
          </p>
          <p>
            As astonishing as that was, what shocked Relhard even more was the
            sensation emanating from the small tree.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt turned to a trembling Relhard and gave a slight smile.
          </p>
          <p>“Relhard, you can feel it, can’t you?”</p>
          <p>“This is unbelievable… How can this be…”</p>
          <p>
            The comforting sensation enveloping them, the amazing sense of
            connection down to every cell, the intense feeling awakening their
            souls—all emanated from this small tree.
          </p>
          <p>There was no room for doubt.</p>

          <p>There could be no doubt.</p>
          <p>
            A sensation known only in legends, but an undeniable truth for any
            elf.
          </p>
          <p>“Elvenheim!”</p>
          <p>Relhard cried out with tears streaming down his face.</p>
          <p>“The World Tree, Elvenheim!”</p>
          <p>* * *</p>
          <p>
            ‘Ah, I’ve barely managed to succeed,’ Repenhardt sighed in relief
            inwardly. He was overjoyed that Siris had chosen him, and in his
            enthusiasm, he had attempted something quite daring, thankfully
            without failing.
          </p>
          <p>
            He awakened the dormant life force within Nihillen, enabling it to
            take root in the earth. Then, to supply the necessary energy, he
            amplified the mana-gathering power that dwelled within Nihillen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Decoding complex magical junk codes and rearranging their patterns
            to recalibrate them was indeed a challenging task for him. Siris and
            Relhard might not know it, but Repenhardt had cast the spell while
            internally fraught with tension. The task was so complex that he
            even resorted to using artificial phantasms along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘After all, the research has finally finished, and it’s only because
            of that I could barely manage to succeed,’ he mused to himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Manipulating the Tidaen Daiman Portal at the completed Daiman ruins
            was similar; resurrecting the World Tree also did not require
            high-level magic if one simply had the information. The magic itself
            was sufficiently controlled with the World Tree’s inherent
            mana-gathering power.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Of course, that doesn’t mean another 6th circle mage could
            resurrect the World Tree just by knowing this information…’
          </p>
          <p>
            The most crucial aspect of resurrecting the World Tree involved
            precise magical manipulation and the control of the ever-changing
            mana currents. This required a sense of finesse and intuition more
            than sheer magical power or computational ability; a feat only
            possible for a grand sorcerer of at least the 9th circle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The magic itself didn’t require high circles, but the control needed
            a kind of enlightenment. Repenhardt, who had already surpassed the
            10th circle in a previous life, managed this with his current,
            lesser capabilities, something that would be impossible for other
            mages even with the answers laid out before them.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Well, the technique itself is something I’m already familiar with
            from previous lives.’
          </p>
          <p>
            The Elvenheim branch, the lost World Tree of Elvenheim, once
            researched by Repenhardt in his past life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the dwarves, orcs, or trolls, the elves heavily relied on the
            spiritual essence of the World Tree. Without resurrecting it, it was
            impossible to restore their former glory. Repenhardt had once
            succeeded in finding the remnants of Elvenheim scattered around the
            world and reviving them through his research.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his previous life, he had revived a total of seven World Trees,
            each as colossal as a human city. Yet, none matched the majesty of
            the legendary true World Tree of Elvenheim, which was said to tower
            over mountain ranges. Although these trees didn’t measure up in
            quality, their quantity was sufficient to somewhat restore the lost
            spirituality of the elves.
          </p>
          <p>‘Yet, all but one were eventually consumed by fire again.’</p>
          <p>
            Reflecting on the past brought a bitter taste to his thoughts.
            Repenhardt shook his head, trying to dispel the memories. This time
            around, gazing at the first World Tree he had revived, a smile of
            satisfaction spread across his face.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wind whistled, weaving through the leaves of the World Tree.
            Nihillen, distinctly tree-like, now gathered the surrounding mana,
            transforming its very nature. Into the once fire-engulfed ravine
            flowed air so crisp and moist that it felt refreshing.
          </p>
          <p>“Ahhh…”</p>
          <p>
            Tears of joy streamed down Relhard’s face. The miracle before him
            wasn’t merely about providing the Danhaim clan a new sanctuary; it
            was the embodiment of hope bestowed upon the entire elven race.
          </p>
          <p>The World Tree sprouted anew.</p>
          <p>Although now just a small sprout…</p>
          <p>
            One day, it would sink its roots deep into the earth and spread its
            branches wide…
          </p>
          <p>This area would become a verdant forest.</p>
          <p>
            And the elves would regain their lost spirituality, truly becoming
            guardians of the forest!
          </p>
          <p>“Who are you? Are you the savior sent by Eldia to deliver us?”</p>
          <p>
            The elf goddess, Eldia. The legend of a savior sent to rescue the
            oppressed elves had been passed down among the Danhaim clan for
            ages. Yet, it had been considered nothing more than a fairy tale
            even among them, not truly believed by any but the children.

          <p>[ Chapter 100 ]</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt gazed gently at Relhard, who was sobbing heavily. Turning
            to Siris, he scratched his head in perplexity.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Uh, sorry, Siris. I’ve used up the Nihillen. I’ll get you something
            better to replace it.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, Siris was hardly in a state to care about the loss of
            mere Nihillen right now. She was utterly bewildered by the miracle
            before her, her mind a blank.
          </p>
          <p>“You are…”</p>
          <p>It was not the time to question Repenhardt.</p>
          <p>“What on earth are you…”</p>
          <p>
            The miracle he had just performed was far beyond Siris’s
            comprehension.
          </p>
          <p>
            Holding her trembling shoulders gently, Repenhardt whispered softly.
          </p>
          <p>“I told you, didn’t I? I’ll explain everything later.”</p>
          <p>“Yes…”</p>
          <p>
            Siris nodded quietly. By now, even the act of questioning Repenhardt
            seemed daunting. Watching the docile Siris, Repenhardt internally
            celebrated.
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, the effort was worth it.’</p>
          <p>
            Thinking how compliant she became just from a slight embrace! Well,
            to speak this way makes it seem like Repenhardt revived the World
            Tree purely out of self-interest, but he is not so frivolous.
            Reviving the World Tree is definitely for a noble cause, of that he
            is certain. Yet, sneaking in a bit of personal gain doesn’t really
            call for condemnation, does it?
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Aiming for multiple effects from a single action is the attitude of
            a great magician.’
          </p>
          <p>Repenhardt, feeling proud, whispered into Siris’s ear.</p>
          <p>“Shall we return to Grand Forge now?”</p>
          <p>Vvvvvvooooom!</p>
          <p>
            From the outskirts of the Grand Forge, a sound vibrated through the
            air at the ruined temple of Al Port. Simultaneously, a giant portal
            opened, spewing out Repenhardt and Siris. They had returned from
            their journey through the Spelrat Desert and the Daiman Ruins.
          </p>
          <p>
            As they completely emerged, the portal began to waver and gradually
            started to disappear. Repenhardt hurriedly formed hand seals in the
            air, murmuring.
          </p>
          <p>“I have to lock it so no one else can use it.”</p>
          <p>
            In this era, no other mage had researched enough to use the portal
            at the Daiman Ruins. However, the unpredictability of the world
            remained. If a high-ranking mage accidentally discovered this portal
            during their exploration, it could cause a major headache. The
            existence of the Grand Forge might be revealed in one fell swoop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore, Repenhardt meticulously applied his magical energy to
            install control codes in all the portals at the Daiman Ruins. Even
            if another mage discovered a portal, they would be unable to
            activate it due to the encryption. Anticipating the chance that a
            grandmaster mage might decipher the code, he also incorporated a
            spell that would destroy the portal if the password was entered
            incorrectly three times. Losing the ancient heritage was painful,
            but it was preferable to risking the safety of the dwarves.
          </p>
          <p>
            As soon as the portal completely vanished, Repenhardt looked down at
            Siris.
          </p>
          <p>“Shall we go?”</p>

          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>
            Siris replied readily, and Repenhardt smiled softly. Although his
            expression remained cold, it was noticeably gentler than his
            previously chilly demeanor. Moreover, the ever-present sense of
            vigilance was gone. His expression was faint only because of his
            long habit of not showing emotions.
          </p>
          <p>‘Indeed, visiting the in-laws was worth it.’</p>
          <p>
            Pleased, Repenhardt walked towards the center of Grand Forge, with
            Siris following him lightly.
          </p>
          <p>The first to greet Repenhardt upon his return was Sillan.</p>
          <p>“Hey, man! Where have you two been wandering off to?”</p>
          <p>“Ah, sorry. Were you worried?”</p>
          <p>
            Anger was clearly visible on Sillan’s face. It was understandable
            for Sillan to be angry since Repenhardt had left with a brief word
            and disappeared for nearly a week.
          </p>
          <p>However, calming the excited Sillan was quite simple.</p>
          <p>
            “Hey! Sillan! Staying a few more days seemed to have broadened your
            shoulders and built some muscle, huh?”
          </p>
          <p>“Really?”</p>
          <p>
            As if the previous tension had vanished, Sillan’s expression quickly
            changed to one of delight, even showing an understanding attitude.
          </p>
          <p>“Well, you could have stayed longer but came back early.”</p>
          <p>
            Though it was impossible for his physique to change significantly in
            just a few days, Sillan genuinely seemed pleased. Repenhardt
            chuckled inwardly.
          </p>
          <p>‘…Such a simple guy.’</p>
          <p>
            Then, a group of dwarves approached him. These dwarves varied in
            age, but unlike others, they were all draped in grey robes. The
            dwarves crowded around Repenhardt, rejoicing.
          </p>
          <p>“Ooh, Master! You have returned!”</p>
          <p>“Why didn’t you at least speak before leaving?”</p>
          <p>“That’s true.”</p>
          <p>
            The dwarves referred to Repenhardt with a title clearly different
            from the others who called him a savior. Repenhardt looked around at
            the dwarves and spoke.
          </p>
          <p>“So, any progress, everyone?”</p>
          <p>“Would you like to see?”</p>
          <p>
            One of the dwarves stepped forward and began gesturing wildly in the
            air. Amidst his bushy beard, a deep voice emerged.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Delphir la Sterin, I grasp the void to strike my enemy with a
            single shot bullet. Aero Bullet!”
          </p>
          <p>
            As he finished speaking, the dwarf stretched out his hand into the
            air. The wind bullet sliced through the atmosphere and struck a
            stone floor about 10 meters away. A slight puff of stone dust
            erupted with a small explosion.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was a first-circle wind magic attack spell, Aero Bullet. Though
            it was a low-grade spell, it was a definite manifestation of magic
            from the hands of a dwarf who had lost magic.
          </p>

          <p>Repenhardt offered his praise.</p>
          <p>
            “Excellent. Both the power and control are impeccable,” the dwarf
            who had cast the magic, his face beaming with pride. The other
            dwarves began to chatter excitedly among themselves.
          </p>
          <p>“Please watch mine too!”</p>
          <p>“Me, too!”</p>
          <p>
            “Alright, everyone will have a turn to cast their magic,” suggested
            another dwarf as they took turns shooting spells into the air. All
            were basic spells of the first circle. With each attempt, Repenhardt
            corrected their magical control and offered advice on their spell
            formulas and chants. Siris smiled faintly at this scene.
          </p>
          <p>‘Repenhardt has succeeded,’ she thought.</p>
          <p>
            These were the newly formed Dwarf Magic Corps at Grand Forge. When
            Repenhardt first arrived at Grand Forge, he had discussed with
            Makelin and asked to gather dwarves he could teach magic to. Many
            dwarves volunteered, eager to regain the lost power of magic, and
            from them, about twenty with potential were selected and trained
            from the basics.
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt himself couldn’t devote much time due to the demands of
            his duties under the subterranean sun(?), but he still managed to
            impart knowledge and correct their magical control whenever he
            could. Now, nearly two months later, they had all reached a level
            where they could competently cast first circle spells.
          </p>
          <p>
            “Achieving such control and sensitivity to magic in just two months
            is a significant achievement. You have all worked hard.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, in his past life, it had taken Repenhardt only two hours
            and twenty minutes to sense magic, but comparing the legendary Demon
            King to ordinary dwarves would be unfair.
          </p>
          <p>
            He sincerely praised the dwarves, who were delighted and wore
            satisfied expressions. Repenhardt continued with a smile.
          </p>
          <p>
            “I have prepared textbooks up to the second circle spells for now,
            so study them diligently. I will occasionally visit Grand Forge to
            supplement the further sections.”
          </p>
          <p>The dwarves nodded unanimously in response.</p>
          <p>“Thank you, Master! We will continue to work hard!”</p>
          <p>
            Magic doesn’t happen overnight. However, Repenhardt was not fated to
            stay comfortably in Grand Forge. Thus, he sacrificed his sleep to
            mobilize all the knowledge he possessed, creating fundamental and
            detailed introductory texts on magic to help the dwarves understand
            it more easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unbeknownst to the dwarves, this act would have astonished other
            magical schools.
          </p>
          <p>
            Magic theory books are indeed circulated in the market, such as “You
            Can Be a Magician Too!” and “Easy and Quick Introduction to Magic”
            among others. Among them, there were quite a few magic books with
            bizarre titles like “Doesn’t Everyone Have at Least One Circle in
            Their Heart?” or “Me, a Magician?”
          </p>
          <p>
            However, most were merely kindling, useless. They were merely
            hastily scribbled works by low-level magicians struggling to make a
            living through magic, so the likelihood of learning magic from them
            was nil. True magicians were extremely secretive about transmitting
            their knowledge. Magic spells are power, weapons, and authority.
            Such knowledge couldn’t be carelessly released into the public.
          </p>
          <p>
            In contrast, the theoretical book written by Repenhardt contained
            clear explanations and easy-to-understand analogies, so someone with
            a fair amount of talent could definitely grasp the basics of magic.
            It was, after all, a comprehensive manual written by one of the
            greatest magicians of ancient and modern times. Considering it was
            impossible to always be by their side, this was sufficient for the
            dwarves to learn magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            ‘Even so, there are limits to learning magic from a book alone,
            which is why I deliberately held off teaching Siris.’
          </p>
          <p>
            After personally overseeing the magic training of the dwarves,
            Repenhardt returned to Sillan. Tilla and Russ were already there,
            having heard of his return. She had significantly improved her
            skills through sparring with other dwarf warriors. Despite being of
            a warrior lineage, her practice alone without competition had left
            her somewhat inexperienced.
          </p>
          <p>“But now, I can truly hold my own as a dwarf warrior.”</p>
          <p>
            Tilla said, beaming with pride, to which Repenhardt gave a
            reassuring look. He then turned to Russ. He was wearing a mithril
            longsword forged by the dwarves at his waist and donned half-plate
            mail made of a mixture of steel and adamantium over leather armor.
            He looked more like a wandering warrior than a knight.
          </p>
          <p>
            “You’re back, brother!” Russ exclaimed with a bright expression.
          </p>
          <p>“Found something enlightening?”</p>

          <p>
            Russ scratched his head, slightly embarrassed. Repenhardt continued
            his inquiry.
          </p>
          <p>“Did you manage to find something?”</p>
          <p>
            “A little,” Russ said, pinching his thumb and forefinger slightly
            with a somewhat smug attitude. However, after scanning Repenhardt
            from head to toe, his expression soured, and he clicked his tongue.
          </p>
          <p>“But…”</p>
          <p>
            What’s with that attitude? Repenhardt was about to frown when Russ
            suddenly sighed deeply.
          </p>
          <p>“I didn’t notice it before, but now it’s clear.”</p>
          <p>“What is?”</p>
          <p>“Brother, you really are huge.”</p>
          <p>“Huh? Did I grow taller recently?”</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt, trembling with fear, placed a hand on his head. He was
            already over 195 centimeters tall and worried about his continuously
            increasing height. The body of Teslon he had reincarnated into was
            growing little by little without even practicing the unique
            breathing techniques of Gym Unbreakable. For most, growth phases
            ended in their mid-teens, but his height was still increasing?
          </p>
          <p>‘Ah, it can’t exceed two meters.’</p>
          <p>
            Others might envy such growth, but Repenhardt remembered his past
            life as Teslon. Standing 230 centimeters tall, he had to stoop even
            when entering buildings and still would bump his forehead against
            the door frames! Everything should have a limit. He definitely
            didn’t want to grow that big!
          </p>
          <p>Russ waved his hands, clarifying.</p>
          <p>
            “No, I don’t mean you’re physically immense… Well, of course you are
            big, but…”
          </p>
          <p>
            He hesitated, choosing his words carefully, then continued
            awkwardly.
          </p>
          <p>“It’s hard to explain, but you’re just big, brother.”</p>
          <p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
          <p>
            “That is, maybe your soul itself is incredibly large? Are you really
            only twenty-three? It feels like you’ve lived several times longer
            than me.”
          </p>
          <p>‘Huh? What on earth has this guy come across?’</p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt looked at Russ with a surprised face. Even though he was
            a powerful aura user himself, he couldn’t comprehend what Russ
            meant. He understood why one might say his soul was huge, but to
            feel it? How was that possible?
          </p>
          <p>
            Repenhardt clicked his tongue. Anyway, geniuses are always a bit
            annoying and hard to understand.
          </p>
          <p>‘Anyway, he must mean that I’ve become stronger.’</p>
          <p>
            With that thought, Repenhardt casually offered some words of
            congratulation. It had been a long time since all five of them were
            together. Sillan, shrugging his shoulders, asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            “So, are we leaving the Grand Forge soon? Back to exploring ruins?”
          </p>
          <p>“Yeah, we need to. Need the money too.”</p>
          <p>
            Everyone looked pleased with the idea. They had been staying here
            for nearly two months, and they were itching to get moving. Both
            Sillan and Russ wanted to test out their new selves in the outside
            world.
          </p>
          <p>“But exploring ruins isn’t our final destination.”</p>
          <p>Shaking his head, Repenhardt spoke up.</p>
          <p>“Our next destination is the Kingdom of Crovence.”</p>
          <p>Feeling the puzzled looks on their faces, he continued.</p>
          <p>“There’s someone there who will agree with my intentions.”</p>
