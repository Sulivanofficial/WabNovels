                    <p>[ Chapter 11 ]</p>
                    <p>“I will take my leave now, Master.”</p>
                    <p>“Congratulations on your descent, my disciple.”</p>
                    <p>
                      A man’s farewell ought to be cool. Repenhardt silently
                      turned away and began to run across the open ground.
                      Before long, the noisy steps grew distant.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Ha ha ha ha ha!”</p>
                    <p>
                      With his silver beard fluttering, Gerard laughed heartily.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘Master, I can finally repay the grace you’ve bestowed
                      upon me.’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Gerard looked up at the chilly winter sky. It seemed as if
                      his master was smiling down at him from above with
                      satisfaction. He then turned his gaze back to the figure
                      of his disciple.
                    </p>
                    <p>The disciple’s running pace began to slow.</p>
                    <p>He kept looking back as he went.</p>
                    <p>
                      It was understandable. Gerard could deeply feel what his
                      disciple, who had finally gained strength after all the
                      hardship and suffering, might be feeling as he descended
                      the mountain. The mixed feelings of excitement and regret
                      were something he had experienced himself 60 years ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Go forth, my disciple!”</p>
                    <p>Gerard thrust his fist into the air.</p>
                    <p>Kwaang!</p>
                    <p>
                      A golden aura surged from his entire body, shooting high
                      into the sky. With a pillar of light, he blessed his
                      disciple as he ventured into the world.
                    </p>
                    <p>Go forth, my disciple.</p>
                    <p>Do not lament our parting.</p>
                    <p>Run forward like a man.</p>
                    <p>
                      You are the disciple of the greatest transmitter of
                      teachings on earth!
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Is this truly the end?’</p>
                    <p>Even as Repenhardt moved on, he kept looking back.</p>
                    <p>‘Is it real? Have I truly been released from here?’</p>
                    <p>
                      Having been through so much hardship, it was hard to
                      believe that he was actually descending the mountain. It
                      felt like a dream he had longed for and lived in was still
                      ongoing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thus, Repenhardt continued to look back as he went down
                      the mountain. It seemed as though that demon-like master
                      of his might chase after him, grab him by the neck, and
                      burst into maniacal laughter saying, ‘Hahaha! I was just
                      kidding. Actually, there’s the next phase of training!’
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But then, suddenly, wasn’t his master flashing his fist in
                      the air and striking the innocent sky?
                    </p>

                    <p>Boom!</p>
                    <p>
                      A punch was thrown into the air, and thunder roared
                      unexpectedly. Indeed, that man was no ordinary human. The
                      pillar of light shone brightly, illuminating even here.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Oh, mother!’</p>
                    <p>
                      A chill ran down his spine instantly. Somehow, it felt
                      like an invitation to stay a bit longer if he didn’t want
                      to descend. Repenhardt, pale as a ghost, turned around and
                      started running.
                    </p>
                    <p>Thud thud thud!</p>
                    <p>
                      Even as the log house (read as hell) disappeared over the
                      hill, the pillar of light still shone brightly. He ran
                      like mad, not looking back.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Crossing two hills, leaping over three brooks, and
                      traversing an entire forest, it was only when Repenhardt
                      reached a place where not even the pillar of light could
                      be seen, with only the distant blur of a golden sky in
                      view, that he finally stopped his sprint.
                    </p>
                    <p>It was then that it truly hit him.</p>
                    <p>“I’ve, I’ve escaped.”</p>
                    <p>Tears welled up uncontrollably.</p>
                    <p>
                      It was real. He had truly descended the mountain. He had
                      truly escaped from that hell.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Uwahahahaha!”</p>
                    <p>
                      Standing there, Repenhardt burst into laughter. After a
                      while of laughing like mad, he finally regained some
                      semblance of sanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Now, there’s much to do.’</p>
                    <p>
                      He needed to reclaim the power of ancient magic and check
                      on what had become of his younger self, Repenhardt.
                      Preparations to rebuild the Antares Empire were also
                      necessary.
                    </p>
                    <p>But above all…</p>
                    <p>‘My Siris, I will see you soon.’</p>
                    <p>
                      With a twinkle in his eye, Repenhardt descended the
                      mountain. Lightly hopping from tree to tree, he swiftly
                      disappeared beyond the forest.
                    </p>
                    <p>* * *</p>
                    <p>
                      In the southern part of the Vasily Kingdom, Chrome City.
                    </p>
                    <p>At the Blue Mane Inn’s second-floor room.</p>
                    <p>
                      There, a young man stood shirtless, gazing at his
                      reflection in the full-length mirror in the room.
                      Suddenly, he muttered as if lamenting,
                    </p>
                    <p>“I’m sorry, Siris… I’ve become like this…”</p>
                    <p>
                      Repenhardt sighed deeply, thinking back to a time that was
                      both a memory from 35 years ago and a future 25 years
                      hence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Seeing his body, reminiscent of an ultimate weapon rather
                      than a finely honed sword, not unlike a brutish stone
                      golem, he couldn’t help but sigh.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      ‘Even if I meet Siris again, would she still like me?’
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      Yet, there were aspects he appreciated. Elves were
                      naturally taller than humans on average. Siris, being a
                      female elf, was no exception, possessing a perfect figure
                      with a tall stature in her previous life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Put simply, Siris was a finger’s length taller than
                      Repenhardt in her previous life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Of course, he was already at an age where he wasn’t swayed
                      by external perceptions, but being a man, he couldn’t help
                      feeling a complex about being shorter than his lover.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Now, I’m much taller, hehehe.’</p>
                    <p>
                      However, realizing he liked this animalistic aspect of
                      himself, Repenhardt fell into despair again. It seemed he
                      had been too influenced by the teachings of Gym
                      Unbreakable.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Ah, I need to snap out of it.’</p>
                    <p>With a click of his tongue, he got dressed again.</p>
                    <p>
                      Having arrived at Chrome City in less than a day, he had
                      booked a luxurious room that cost a silver coin a day and
                      was taking a rest for the first time in a while. Having a
                      human meal for the first time in ages and relieving mental
                      fatigue truly made life worth living.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Looking out the window, he saw a few pedestrians passing
                      by on the street. People wrapping their clothes tightly
                      against the winter cold and walking briskly. It was an
                      ordinary scene with nothing special, but to him, who had
                      lived in the mountains for nearly six years, even this
                      seemed fascinating.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Anyway, coming down to the world is indeed pleasant.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Suddenly, Repenhardt rummaged through his belongings. He
                      then pulled out a small, rolled-up piece of parchment.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Anyway….”</p>
                    <p>
                      He murmured as he examined a traveler’s map of the
                      continent he had bought from a nearby general store.
                    </p>
                    <p>“At this time, surely Siris must be here….”</p>
                    <p>
                      His gaze moved to the top of the map. The Duchy of Chatan
                      in the northern part of the continent, a trade nation that
                      thrived on being an intermediary, located in a tributary
                      of the Setellad Mountains. It was also the place where
                      slave trading was most rampant on the continent.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘Siris…’</p>
                    <p>
                      Repenhardt recalled her past that he had heard about from
                      time to time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      His lover from a previous life, the High Elf woman, Siris
                      Valencia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      She had grown up among Elves who barely survived in the
                      wilderness of the continent’s outlands and was captured by
                      slave hunters at the age of twenty, which would be about
                      five or six in human years.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The slave trader, deeming Siris too young and thus of
                      lesser value, had sent her to a training camp first, and
                      she spent her childhood there, from what he had heard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “She was just under a hundred years old in her past life,
                      so now she would be around seventy? In human terms, that
                      would be around seventeen or eighteen.”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Eventually, when she came of age, Siris, who had been
                      living as a sexual plaything sold to wealthy humans, met
                      Repenhardt. It took almost three years for her, both body
                      and soul battered, to smile again.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Holding the face of his beloved in his thoughts,
                      Repenhardt clenched the map tightly and frowned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Rebuilding the empire and reviving magic are all well and
                      good…”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      But this is the most urgent. Knowing what fate Siris will
                      face, how could he just leave her be? Saving her is the
                      top priority.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “It’s the year 984 in the continental calendar. If Siris
                      is to be sold, there’s about a year left… She’ll still be
                      in the Duchy of Chatan.”
                    </p>

                    <p>
                      His course was set. Repenhardt roughly stuffed the map
                      back into his pocket and pondered for a moment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “What should I do? Should I go to the Chatan Duchy now,
                      smash the auction house, and rescue Siris?”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If it were the Repenhardt of old, he could have easily
                      done it. Additionally, he might have been able to save
                      other elves suffering in the process. But now, without the
                      power of great magic, that task was too burdensome.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Well, even now, it’s possible to destroy an auction house
                      and save Siris with just the power of a martial artist.
                      However, doing so would mean living a life constantly on
                      the run. To regain the power of magic, it’s better to
                      avoid troublesome matters as much as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Maybe it’s better to handle this quietly, huh?”</p>
                    <p>
                      In the end, Repenhardt decided to buy Siris. The thought
                      of buying his beloved woman with money was truly
                      unpleasant, but there was no other choice given the
                      situation.
                    </p>
                    <p>‘I’ll need money.’</p>
                    <p>
                      And a tremendous amount of it. The price of elven slaves
                      was beyond imagination. And right now, he was nearly
                      penniless.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, Repenhardt wasn’t overly worried about money. He
                      might not have been strong enough to change the situation
                      drastically, but he certainly had the power to rescue at
                      least one elven slave from the clutches of fate.

                    <p>
                      With an aura-awakened strong body, martial arts skills
                      that had reached a high level, and most importantly, his
                      knowledge of the future!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “Let’s see, if it’s the year 984 of the Continental
                      Calendar, then surely Todd…”
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A faint smile appeared on his lips as he recalled his
                      memories.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Yes, it was definitely here.”</p>
                    <p>
                      Located in the central part of the Vasily Kingdom,
                      slightly off the main road leading to the Chatan Duchy,
                      the Hattan Mountain Range.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Looking at the place marked on the map, Repenhardt’s eyes
                      shone.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The small mountain village at the foot of the Hattan
                      Mountains, Cattle Village.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Like most villages of slash-and-burn farmers, this place
                      was also built by those who fled from the harsh
                      exploitation of a wicked lord. Barely making ends meet by
                      tilling the narrow farmlands, and occasionally struggling
                      to survive through hunting and gathering. However, being
                      deep in the mountains yet slightly away from the monsters’
                      territory, it was relatively a peaceful place.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The people of this Cattle Village, who were poor but had
                      been living in peace, encountered an unprecedented
                      disaster two days ago.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In front of the village hall located at the center of the
                      village.
                    </p>
                    <p>“It’s dangerous, Chief.”</p>
                    <p>
                      Calling it a village hall sounds nice, but it was nothing
                      more than a log house, a bit larger than the other homes.
                      Yet, it stood as the most splendid wooden building in
                      Cattle Village, in front of which four middle-aged men
                      were standing. And in front of them, an old man with a
                      resolved expression stood. An elderly man who had aged
                      thoroughly, his face filled with the hardships of life,
                      looking quite unsightly.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      “I’m fine. Even if the opponent is a noble, shouldn’t we
                      say what needs to be said?”
                    </p>
                    <p>“Village chief…….”</p>
                    <p>
                      Leaving behind looks mixed with worry and respect, the old
                      man waited silently, bowing in front of the village hall.
                      After a while, a middle-aged man dressed in shimmering
                      armor walked out. This middle-aged man, turning
                      forty-three this year, was Sir Edward, a knight serving
                      the Altion Ducal Family, a lineage of great prestige
                      within the Vasily Kingdom.
                    </p>
                    <p>“What’s the matter, village chief?”</p>
                    <p>
                      The old man swallowed hard, and he looked up at the
                      ‘unexpected disaster’ before him.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A group of knights in splendid armor, who suddenly
                      appeared in the peaceful Cattle Village, brought their
                      warhorses deep into the mountains, introducing themselves
                      as from the prestigious Altion Ducal Family of the royal
                      capital and bluntly demanding accommodations and
                      provisions to be prepared for a brief stay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Facing these fierce knights, the simple mountain villagers
                      could hardly resist. They vacated several homes and gave
                      up all their food prepared for the winter. Occupying five
                      large houses and the entire village hall among the less
                      than twenty log houses in the village, these men continued
                      to deplete the village’s food supplies while settling in.
                      They were practically no different from bandits, except
                      for perhaps not coveting the village women as knights
                      might.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Naturally, the village was in uproar. Those who were
                      driven out of their comfortable homes might have
                      temporarily stayed in others’ houses, but without the food
                      consumed by these visitors, the villagers would all
                      starve. Had it been summer, they might have survived on
                      hunting or gathering berries, but it was the middle of
                      winter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Thus, the village chief had come to find this knight, even
                      in a state of fear.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      If they couldn’t get compensation for the food from these
                      men, Cattle Village would be annihilated.

                      <p>
                        “There, knights, you need to pay for the food you’ve
                        consumed…”
                      </p>
                      <p>“Huh? Oh.”</p>
                      <p>
                        Upon seeing the trembling village chief, Sir Edward
                        couldn’t help but smirk.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        To think not of the honor of supporting the great
                        knight’s journey but only of immediate profits, truly
                        foolish beyond measure. The chief doesn’t realize that
                        his village’s name could be immortalized in bards’ songs
                        as part of the legendary deeds of the Altion Marquisate.
                      </p>
                      <p>‘Indeed, these lowly ones know nothing of honor!’</p>
                      <p>
                        However, Edward considered himself a generous knight.
                        Thus, he rummaged through his belongings and tossed a
                        gold coin to the chief.
                      </p>
                      <p>“This should be more than enough.”</p>
                      <p>
                        The chief’s eyes widened. Edward, enjoying his own
                        generosity, stroked his chin.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        ‘After all, when would these ignorant villagers have
                        ever seen a gold coin?’
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        He was half right. It was indeed the chief’s first time
                        seeing a gold coin. But his expression was not one of
                        amazement or admiration.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “Si- Sir knight, this is far from enough to cover the
                        meal costs for the knights…….”
                      </p>
                      <p>“What did you say?”</p>
                      <p>Edward’s eyes narrowed in a flash.</p>
                      <p>‘Is this lowlife daring to haggle with a knight?’</p>
                      <p>His disbelief quickly turned to anger.</p>
                      <p>
                        By law, such remote villages, not officially recognized
                        as part of any lordship and thus outside the protection
                        of any noble, could be wiped out and plundered by
                        knights without any legal repercussions. They had
                        forsaken the lord’s protection, and thus, the laws of
                        the Vasily Kingdom did not shelter them either.
                      </p>
                      <p>To show them mercy, only for them to dare bargain?</p>
                      <p>
                        “You wretch! Do you think that I as a noble am unaware
                        of the market prices?”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The food he had taken from this village was of such poor
                        quality that it was worth no more than a hundred silver
                        coins. A gold coin was indeed a gesture of generosity.
                      </p>
                      <p>“Yes, but, what?”</p>
                      <p>
                        Seeing the flustered old man, Edward was convinced. This
                        despicable elder, seeing the splendid knights, must be
                        trying to extort them thoroughly. How dare a lowborn try
                        to swindle a noble?
                      </p>
                      <p>“How dare you mock a knight!”</p>

                      <p>
                        With a burst of anger, Edward struck the old man. Not
                        hard, of course. Even such foolish villagers were
                        citizens of the Vasily Kingdom, after all, and could not
                        be killed. Just enough to teach him his place.
                      </p>
                      <p>“Oh dear dear dear!”</p>
                      <p>
                        With a scream, the old man fell, clutching his face.
                        Blood trickled out between his wrinkled fingers.
                      </p>
                      <p>“Village chief!”</p>
                      <p>“Oh my, the village chief!”</p>
                      <p>
                        Villagers who were afar rushed to support the old man.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Amidst the commotion, a handsome young man in his late
                        twenties walked out from the hall.
                      </p>
                      <p>“What’s the matter, Sir Edward?”</p>
                      <p>“Oh, it’s nothing, Lord Stefan.”</p>
                      <p>
                        As the young man appeared, Sir Edward was startled and
                        bowed politely.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The young man, Stefan von Lepanto Altion, the second son
                        of the Altion family and holder of the title from the
                        Lepanto barony, was a noble whom he was bound to serve
                        and also his superior as a knight. Despite his young
                        age, he possessed remarkable swordsmanship skills,
                        earning him the title of ‘Knight of Firmness’, and was
                        already among the top ten warriors within the Vasily
                        Kingdom.
                      </p>
                      <p>Edward bowed respectfully and said,</p>
                      <p>
                        “No, it’s just some lowly people making a fuss because
                        they think the money I gave them wasn’t enough.”
                      </p>
                      <p>“How much did you give them?”</p>
                      <p>
                        Stefan was puzzled. The Sir Edward he knew was a
                        generous knight who would not have been stingy with the
                        reward.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “I generously gave a gold coin to those living hard in
                        the mountains.”
                      </p>
                      <p>“Really? That should be enough, shouldn’t it?”</p>
                      <p>
                        Wise Stefan quickly grasped the situation. To him, it
                        sounded outrageously greedy. Anger appeared on the young
                        man’s face.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “Huh, with what we took, one gold coin should have been
                        more than enough. Truly despicable.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Stefan shook his head disapprovingly and comforted his
                        knight, who had not received thanks despite his
                        generosity.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “This is why you shouldn’t just freely show mercy to the
                        lowly. They try to rise above their station without
                        knowing their place.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “Your words are wise, my lord. I’ve made a great
                        mistake.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Watching the two knights converse calmly, the old man
                        shed tears.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        No! What about the transport and labor costs? In your
                        city, one gold coin might suffice, but here, the cost of
                        food is more than twenty times that! Plus, it’s the
                        middle of winter, to buy food one has to risk their life
                        going through blizzards!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        But the village chief couldn’t protest. Having been
                        struck by a thick steel gauntlet, his few remaining
                        teeth were knocked out, spilling blood.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Eventually, the villagers took the unconscious village
                        chief away, crying. Stefan watched them leave with an
                        indifferent gaze before returning to the hall.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In a crudely built log hall, barren except for a shabby
                        bed, table, and chairs, Stefan frowned. Compared to his
                        bedroom in the capital, this was no better than a
                        storeroom.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        ‘But a true knight should be able to sleep even in a mud
                        puddle.’
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Ah, to think he could sleep even in such a rubbish heap!
                        Stefan felt proud, seeing it as a sign of becoming a
                        true knight, conveniently ignoring that the villagers
                        always lived in such conditions.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Inside the hall, a man in his mid-thirties, cloaked in a
                        robe, was deep in meditation. Stefan called out to him.
                      </p>
                      <p>“Magician Todd.”</p>
                      <p>The man opened his eyes and quickly bowed his head.</p>
                      <p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
                      <p>“Have you found the location of the ruins yet?”</p>
                      <p>
                        “Please wait a little longer. The mountainous terrain
                        and winter season are disrupting the mana flows…”
                      </p>
                      <p>Seeing Todd’s troubled look, Stefan sighed.</p>
                      <p>“Please find it quickly.”</p>
                      <p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
                      <p>
                        After pressing the magician further, Stefan walked to
                        the window, leaning on the frame and gazing out at the
                        snow-covered mountains and fields.
                      </p>
                      <p>“This must be the place, right?”</p>
                      <p>“It is certain, my lord.”</p>
                      <p>
                        Sir Edward, who had approached silently, replied
                        confidently.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “This is where the great swordsman, Sir Claude von
                        Leotus Altion, lies buried.”
                      </p>
                      <p>* * *</p>
                      <p>
                        Three days after leaving Chrome City, Repenhardt was
                        walking along the central road, carrying a small
                        backpack.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Surrounded by snow-covered fields and sparse trees, the
                        central road cutting through the Vasily Kingdom in a
                        cross shape was desolate in the winter, with no one else
                        in sight.
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Due to the risks of blizzards and the common fate of
                        traders dying on the road in winter, hardly anyone dared
                        to travel during this season.
                      </p>
                      <p>Yet, Repenhardt was unfazed.</p>
                      <p>
                        “This crazy body of mine does have excellent stamina,
                        after all.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Despite his nonchalance, he was dressed appropriately
                        for winter travel, in a thick fur coat and a scarf,
                        looking every part the exemplary traveler.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        In truth, his current physique could easily dismiss such
                        cold as a mere breeze, so there was no real need for
                        such warm clothing. However, wandering around in just a
                        shirt in the middle of winter would certainly attract
                        unwarranted attention.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        While past Kings of Strength might have flaunted their
                        muscles by wandering around shirtless even in winter,
                        Repenhardt, claiming to still possess a sense of
                        humanity, preferred not to stand out.
                      </p>
                      <p>“Still, the coat was a bit pricey.”</p>
                      <p>
                        After spending another ten silver coins on the coat and
                        other travel necessities, the money Gerard had given him
                        had halved.
                      </p>
                      <p>“But soon, money will be easy to come by.”</p>
                      <p>
                        Repenhardt chuckled quietly to himself. In his past
                        life, he had made a name for himself as an explorer of
                        ruins, wandering across the continent in his youth. And
                        all that information was still perfectly preserved in
                        his memory.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        That meant he had knowledge of all the ruins that would
                        be discovered within the next 30 years. And not just any
                        knowledge—he knew exactly what treasures each ruin held!
                        In other words, he could selectively visit only the most
                        lucrative ruins and extract their most valuable secrets!
                      </p>
                      <p>‘What a coincidence this is.’</p>
                      <p>
                        Scratching his cheek, Repenhardt reminisced about his
                        past. It was about his childhood, when he was fervently
                        learning magic in the tower of Delphia. There was a mage
                        named ‘Todd’ who specialized in exploring ruins and was
                        affiliated with the tower.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Todd, who was very fond of the young Repenhardt, used to
                        share his heroic tales with him whenever he returned to
                        the tower. Among those stories was an adventure with the
                        Altion Marquis family near the Hattan Mountains.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        ‘The date just had to coincide with the day I came down
                        from the mountains.’
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Today being the 14th day of the ice moon, Todd would
                        likely be staying in a mountain village near the Hattan
                        Mountains. It was a long time ago, so remembering the
                        exact date was difficult, but with the legendary skill
                        of ‘Artificial Flashback,’ Repenhardt could always pull
                        out and check his past memories accurately.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        ‘I’m sure I went on an expedition myself after hearing
                        Todd’s story and getting older. Hmm.’
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Ancient ruins are usually complex in geography, so even
                        if they have been explored, there’s a high chance that
                        something was missed. This was true for the Hattan
                        Mountain ruins as well, where Repenhardt managed to find
                        ‘real’ artifacts that Todd’s group had missed, netting a
                        significant sum.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        “I sold everything that came out and made over two
                        thousand gold coins, so it was quite a profitable ruin.
                        Hahaha.”
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Therefore, Repenhardt deliberately chose this route.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Even if Todd’s group had already looted the ruin by the
                        time he descended, it was no issue. The underground part
                        of the ruin would still be unexplored. If not, he could
                        always go to another ruin.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        On the way to the Lastil Duchy, there were four more
                        high-value ruins in Repenhardt’s memory that had yet to
                        be unearthed. Even if the timing wasn’t right, making
                        money was not a problem.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        The reason he specifically wanted to get involved in
                        Todd’s past was…
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        ‘I should take this opportunity to find out about the
                        condition of my body in this era.’
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        Todd was quite close to him when he was young, so he
                        would likely have a good understanding of Repenhardt in
                        this era. Meeting him could yield some valuable
                        information.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                        As he continued walking with these plans in mind, the
                        white mountain range beyond the horizon began to come
                        into view. It was the snow-covered Hattan Mountains.
                      </p>
                      <p>“The destination is coming into sight.”</p>
                      <p>
                        Repenhardt increased his pace and then leaped into the
                        air. With an incredible jump, he crossed the path in an
                        instant and began rushing fiercely towards the Hattan
                        Mountains.

                        <p><span id="span"></span>An hour later, Repenhardt stood atop a hill, sweat-free, gazing down at a small mountain village. It had taken him 30 minutes to cross the vast distance to the Hattan Mountains, far off the main road, and another 30 minutes to navigate through the rugged terrain to reach Cattle Village. Even on horseback, one couldn’t cover the distance this quickly. The speed he now possessed was something he couldn’t have even imagined during his days as a magician.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>With a slight, very slight sense of gratitude towards Gerard, Repenhardt surveyed the village.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“It’s exactly as I remember.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Cattle Village was the same as ever, both in the past and now. Still shabby, still a humble little mountain hamlet. It should have been 20 years before he would come to this place again, yet the scene before him had hardly changed, truly a backwater village through and through.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>The flimsy fence surrounding the village to fend off wild beasts, about twenty log houses within, and a large hall at the center. Focusing his gaze on that hall, he concentrated for a moment.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Ral Tara Sakita, the eyes of the hawk soar through the sky. Double Watcher.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Casting the 1st Circle Vision Spell, Double Watcher, his view extended, bringing the interior of the hall into closer perspective. Had he used a higher circle spell, he might have been able to see inside the hall, but he hadn’t yet reached that level. Instead, Repenhardt used this state to sense presences.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>‘Two human men with the aura of warriors, and two ordinary men, one of which is a boy. And three orcs. Slaves, perhaps? And one female presence. The distinctive lightness of her steps suggests she’s an elf woman. He’s keeping a Slayer with him?’</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>The concept of a beautiful female warrior who is also formidable in battle is a fantasy cherished by many men. However, with human women, once they reach a certain level of warrior status, it often becomes difficult to distinguish their gender due to their muscle.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Elves are different. Whether male or female, they maintain a slender and attractive appearance by human standards, even as competent warriors.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Where there’s demand, supply follows. Slave traders began to select elves with potential, specially training them in combat to sell.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>That was the origin of ‘Slayers’.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>A beautiful elven swordswoman, useful as a bodyguard by day and serving at one’s bedside at night, not only had practical value but also fulfilled the fantasies of many men! Consequently, it became fashionable for nobles of considerable rank to keep at least one Slayer.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>‘Well, being of a count’s family, it’s expected for him to have his own personal Slayer.’</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>He continued to scout the village. The distance between him and Cattle Village was almost 300~400 meters; at this range, no matter how sensitive his senses were, he couldn’t feel any presence. Moreover, his current level of magic was only at a basic level, not reaching that far. However, when the unique senses of a warrior combined with magic, the effect was comparable to an intermediate-level long-range spell.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“There are five more guys in each house with the aura of a warrior. Just as I heard.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>As expected, the Marquis of Altion was staying in Cattle Village. Repenhardt stroked his chin. If it was just about gathering money, he could either hurry to the ruins before them or wait for them to leave and go later. However, he currently needed information from Todd. But approaching strangers out of the blue and asking, ‘Can I join your group?’ would only get him treated as a madman. He needed an excuse.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>And he had already thought of that excuse.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Let’s see…”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Repenhardt turned his gaze. A reasonably large log house on the outskirts of the village, where a good number of villagers were gathered, came into view. He could feel the strong emotions of panic and anger. A smile appeared on his lips.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>In Cattle Village, about a dozen villagers were raising their voices in Ted’s cabin, the village’s leading hunter.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“What should we do now?”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Everyone’s faces were filled with worry. The Marquis of Altion or something that had occupied the village had taken away their food and supplies, beaten the village chief, and then made excessive demands.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“The Valley of Death is a place we should never get close to…”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Half a day’s journey from Cattle Village, there was a forbidden valley called ‘The Valley of Death.’ While the name might seem cliché, the villagers didn’t expect much from a name they had given themselves. Anyway, since people who approached it tended to die, a strict unwritten rule had been firmly established in Cattle Village for generations to stay away from it.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>But those knights had requested—or rather, demanded—that someone guide them there. Of course, the villagers had shown their unhappiness, but…</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Didn’t those people demand a guide? Who knows what they’ll do if we refuse?”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>One middle-aged man, half of his face bruised purple, rubbed his eyes as he yelled. He was the representative of the village who had gone to plead with them and ended up getting hit.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Even the village chief has become like this…”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Ah, those dirty nobles.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Watch your words! Who knows what will happen if they hear you!”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Kugh!”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>The villagers looked at each other and sighed deeply. It was a sorrowful sight. Being powerless, they had been chased to this point, and even here, without power, they ended up in such a state.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>A gloomy atmosphere filled the hut. After a while, a relatively robust middle-aged man spoke up with determination.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“I’ll go.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Ted! You’re going?”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Well, I am the best at climbing mountains in our village, aren’t I? And I know well that there’s no one else to go.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>‘So, that’s why they are holding this kind of meeting at our house.’</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Ted looked at the villagers with resentful eyes. It was clear from the start that they were implying, ‘You should go, right?’ What kind of meeting is this?</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Ted abruptly stood up and picked up the bow that was hanging on the wall. The commanding figure startled the woman and the little girl standing by.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Honey!”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Daddy!”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Hearing the worried voices of his family made his body stiffen again. Ted gritted his teeth.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Kugh…….”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>He stood up like a man, driven by the atmosphere, but his feet wouldn’t move.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>He didn’t want to go. He really didn’t want to go. Leaving his wife and child to go to that dangerous place was absolutely dreadful. He was a hunter, and therefore, he was well aware of the dangers of the Valley of Death.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>As Ted hesitated to pick up the bow, the villagers’ eyes sparkled even more. Grab the bow! Ted! Aren’t you a man! A man should not say one thing and do another!</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>The hut’s atmosphere was slowly turning into coercion, and as Ted was stuck in indecision, suddenly a strange voice came from the window.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Shall I go then?”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Who, who are you?”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Everyone turned in surprise. Was it one of the knights who had heard their conversation? Their faces turned pale. They had been cursing the dirty nobles, after all. Considering the knights’ personalities, the chance of them just laughing it off was virtually zero.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>However, the owner of the voice was not a knight. It was a young man they had never seen before, wearing a thick coat and having a rather sharp impression.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>The young man continued speaking calmly through the window.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Just a traveler passing by. I happened to overhear your conversation.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Coincidence? Which traveler happens to accidentally peek under someone else’s eaves? Everyone in the village and the traveler himself knew it was nonsense, but they all ignored it.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>What the traveler had said was of greater importance. Ted asked with a trembling voice.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Do you happen to know the geography around here?”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Quite well, actually.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Because he had been here before. And he had cleanly revived those memories with an artificial magic lantern.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“So, you really intend to go to the Valley of Death?”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“I’ve been there once before.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Specifically, he would end up going there 20 years into the future.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>A look of unhideable emotion flashed across Ted’s face.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Oh. God! Thank you!”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“You’ll be blessed, young man.”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>All the villagers expressed their gratitude to Repenhardt with happy faces. A little thought would have made them immediately realize how suspicious the situation was, but instead of being wary, they readily believed it. It seemed they were people who had lived naively in the mountains, not thinking that far.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Yet, in their naivety, they were concerned for Repenhardt.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“But no one who has entered the Valley of Death has come back alive. Are you sure it’ll be alright…”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“I’ve been there once, haven’t I?”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Repenhardt’s nonchalant attitude reassured everyone. Ted’s face brightened, and he hurried to the door.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>“Then, I’ll inform them immediately!”</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>It seemed he was intent on quickly informing the knights before this divinely sent savior could change his mind, making it a fait accompli. Despite their simplicity, there was a not-so-subtle slyness to them.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Repenhardt watched the middle-aged hunter running off with a wry smile.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>According to what Todd had told him, this hunter would go near the ruins, eventually be attacked by a monster, and not return alive. Those knights did not care about the well-being of such ignorant villagers.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>‘Think yourself lucky. I’m saving a life here.’</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Around the year 930 by the continental calendar, about 50 years ago from now, in the marquis family of Altion in the Vasily Kingdom, there was an outstanding knight named ‘Claude’.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>He was a particularly strong knight, even in the renowned chivalrous household of the Altion marquisate. Astonishingly, he awakened his aura at the young (?) age of forty-five, possessing incredible strength and remarkable swordsmanship.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Even now, within the Vasily Kingdom, there are only three people, including Sir Talion, the captain of the knights, who have awakened their aura, which gives some indication of how formidable Claude’s strength was.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Commensurate with his extraordinary abilities, he embarked on various adventures, and his heroic deeds echoed throughout the Vasily Kingdom. It is said that when people are overly praised, they lose grasp of reality. Claude, once celebrated as a hero, grew increasingly arrogant and ultimately made a choice that should never have been made.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Passing near the Hattan Mountains, he stumbled upon the Valley of Death, which he was certain was an ancient ruin. Thinking it a noble, knightly judgment to offer the ruin’s treasures to his lord, the King of the Vasily Kingdom, he decided to venture into the ruin. This might have seemed a commendable decision at first, but what followed was problematic. Believing he was as capable as others said, he ventured into the ruin with only one follower.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>This ancient ruin, commonly called a dungeon, is a remnant of the forgotten, distant past, known as the ‘Silver Age’, a time when a highly advanced magical civilization allowed humanity to attain god-like powers. Various theories exist on how this great civilization came to disappear, but the truth remains unknown. Explorers of these ruins can only acquire relics from that era and praise the great civilization.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Exploring these dungeons was never an easy task. The astonishing power of the Silver Age’s magical civilization was such that most of the remaining ruins were severely distorted by spatial warps, stretching across dimensions. The exposed magical energy could transform ordinary beasts into terrifying monsters, and the auras from other dimensions seeping through the dimensional rifts led to various magical creatures and spirits, making it impossible for even the strongest warrior to ensure their survival alone in such expeditions.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Claude, in his arrogance, entered such a place with only one follower, and the outcome was predictably disastrous. Claude fought desperately and ultimately died. The real issue, however, was not just his death, but that he had taken with him the powerful magic sword ‘Altion’, a family heirloom of the Altion Marquisate, and lost it.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>The magic sword Altion was valuable not only for the magic it contained but also as a symbol of the Altion Marquis Family. Losing it caused great turmoil within the family. However, no one knew exactly where Claude had died. The only clue was the incoherent babbling of his severely traumatized and mad surviving follower.</p>
<p><span id="span"></span>Relying on these few incoherent words, the Altion Marquis’s family spent 50 years searching for Claude’s resting place. Finally, in the year 984 of the continental calendar, they discovered the ruin in the Hattan Mountains and sent troops to retrieve the family’s precious sword.</p>

                        










                    </div>



                        <p>[ Chapter 14 ]</p>
<p>‘That kid who seems about my grandson’s age is him…’</p>
<p>Repenhardt recalled an old tale he had heard from Todd, inadvertently lifting his head. Far ahead, he saw a handsome young knight, adorned in splendid armor, walking along a mountain path.</p>
<p>Stefan von Lepanto Altion. He was walking with a grim expression, leading six knights. Since riding horses in such mountainous terrain was impractical, they had left their horses in Cattle Village and were walking towards the ‘Valley of Death’. A knight should be on horseback to truly be a knight; walking in shiny armor made him feel pitiful.</p>
<p>And right beside him, an elf woman clung to him with a flirtatious face.</p>
<p>“Master, even without riding a horse, your elegance does not fade at all. Truly, you are a knight among knights.”</p>
<p>“Ha-ha, hearing you say that does make me feel better, Relsia.”</p>
<p>Stefan chuckled, casually stroking the elf woman’s buttocks. He was harassing a woman in broad daylight without any hesitation. The one doing it, the one it’s being done to, and those watching, all seemed incredibly natural about it.</p>
<p>Repenhardt felt slightly annoyed, but did not show it.</p>
<p>‘The values of the entire continent are like this, what can you do.’</p>
<p>Getting angry over such scenes on a daily basis would make it impossible to travel the world. Besides, this Stefan fellow was amusing. The slave, Relsia, only spoke words that pleased her master, and yet he kept giggling as if it was something wonderful.</p>
<p>‘He’s just a greenhorn.’</p>
<p>Repenhardt quickly lost interest in Stefan and looked behind. Three orc slaves were following the knights, carrying their belongings on the mountain path. Beside them, two individuals appeared to be having a conversation. A wizard, Todd, and a pretty boy with long red hair.</p>
<p>‘Was his name Sillan?’</p>
<p>At first, Repenhardt thought he was a girl. Such was the beauty of this boy named Sillan. In his youth, Repenhardt was quite handsome himself (of course, this was in his past life), but never to the extent that one could not distinguish his gender. Honestly, only his trained warrior’s intuition indicated he was male; visually, he still looked like a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>Moreover, this boy was also a priest of Philanence, the Goddess of Beauty, Mercy and Love. To avoid ending up like Claude, the House of Altion dispatched its strongest knights along with experienced mages and priests for the exploration. The presence of a priest, blessed by the goddess to wield various healing and enhancement spells, was indispensable for tomb exploration.</p>
<p>‘But can someone his age properly cast divine spells?’</p>
<p>Seeing Silas laugh brightly and chatter away like a young girl in front of Todd, Repenhardt couldn’t help but feel distrustful. However, since he was accepted into the prestigious Altion family as a clergyman, albeit a clumsy one, it was likely that he possessed considerable skill.</p>
<p>After all, being young doesn’t necessarily mean being weak. Repenhardt, too, had already reached the level of an average formal magician during his boyhood in his previous life, and now, in his early twenties, wasn’t he an aura user?</p>
<p>Repenhardt soon turned his gaze towards Todd. The only reason he was part of this group was to gather information about his current self from Todd.</p>
<p>‘I should find an opportunity to start a conversation…’</p>
<p>But it was hard to find the right moment as he had been incessantly talking to the priest boy who acted like a young girl. Watching them, it felt like seeing his younger self chattering away, which gave him an odd feeling.</p>
<p>‘Wait! Todd, could he possibly have a preference for men?’</p>
<p>A chill ran down his spine. It was a horrifying thought that he himself could have been in such a situation during his childhood… Indeed, in the mage tower where males were predominant, all sorts of strange incidents often occurred. Fortunately, Repenhardt had never experienced such things, but the mere thought of it was unsettling.</p>
<p>‘Eh, no way, Todd seemed like a decent person. It couldn’t be.’</p>
<p>Trying to dismiss the thought, he shook his head, and then Sir Edward approached him.</p>
<p>“You’ve made an excellent choice, traveler.”</p>
<p>“It’s nothing special, just guiding the way.”</p>
<p>Repenhardt shrugged nonchalantly, and Sir Edward laughed in response.</p>
<p>He looked at the brave young man with a face full of admiration. Naturally. The foolish villagers had vehemently refused to guide them to their destination, the ancient ruins of ‘Falton.’</p>
<p>To be honest, Sir Edward had not expected to be turned down. After all, he wasn’t asking them to enter the ruins with him, just to guide him nearby. The fact that they were too scared to even do that was beyond belief.</p>
<p>He was so incredulous that he couldn’t even be angry. He had even slapped a whining middle-aged man lightly, mulling over the issue internally. Knowing the geography was essential for guiding them without getting lost, and reaching their destination would please the Lord Stefan whom he served.</p>
<p>But it would go against chivalry to force the unwilling villagers. Chivalry may have narrow standards, but it explicitly instructs the protection of the weak. Using force was not the way of a knight. The light slap he had given was meant as a mild correction for foolishness, not an act of oppression, Sir Edward firmly believed.</p>
<p>As this loyal middle-aged knight was grumbling, a brave traveler happened to come by and offered to guide them instead. It was truly a welcome occurrence.</p>
<p>“Tsk, what cowards.”</p>
<p>“It’s only natural to be afraid.”</p>
<p>As Repenhardt subtly took the side of the villagers, Edward frowned.</p>
<p>“Ha! What is there to fear when the valiant knights of the kingdom are with us? They are truly ignorant fools. Tsk tsk, anyway, I express my gratitude in the name of the House of Altion for your help.”</p>
<p>After praising this brave youth, Edward walked back to Stefan’s side. He firmly believed he had done his duty by praising the other’s bravery without spending a single penny, which was truly knight-like.</p>
<p>‘Anyway, these knights…’</p>
<p>Repenhardt slightly shook his head.</p>
<p>Not all knights in the world were like this, but the profession of knights was inevitably bound to have such arrogant and presumptuous aspects.</p>
<p>From the start, the path of knighthood is nothing less than a fine method for nurturing narcissists. The very point of harping on about honor is already flawed. In other words, there’s no knight who doesn’t act superior. There are knights who are truly superior, so their superiority isn’t just an act.</p>
<p>Of course, among them, there are excellent knights who have a sense of reality and are properly grounded, but these fellows certainly do not fit that case.</p>
<p>Knights are arrogant, magicians are narrow-minded, and clerics are old-fashioned.</p>
<p>This prejudiced adage floating around the continent didn’t come from nowhere. Honestly, Repenhardt himself was quite narrow-minded before meeting other races, so he felt somewhat hypocritical blaming others.</p>
<p>While walking and thinking such thoughts, something suddenly caught his senses. Something was fiercely flying from beyond the forest to the sky.</p>
<p>‘Ah, this must be it. The hunter that died…’</p>
<p>Soon after, a shout was heard from ahead.</p>
<p>“An attack! Form up!”</p>
<p>The noisy flapping of wings filled the surroundings. A sharp cry tore through the ears. It was a flying monster, a harpy, with the face of a woman, the body of a bird, and feathers of steel.</p>
<p>The carnivorous harpies, which usually inhabited cliffs and particularly fancied human flesh, attacked the humans on sight.</p>
<p>Dozens of harpies were swarming the mountain path’s sky.</p>
<p>“Kyaahhhh!”</p>
<p>With a sharp screech reminiscent of a woman’s scream, one of the harpies aimed its talons at Stefan. Stefan, with a tense face, drew his sword.</p>
<p>“How dare a filthy beast target a human under the protection of Seiya!”</p>
<p>With an archaic tone, Stefan executed a diagonal slash, the Delayed Strike. With a precise posture and swift sword strike, he instantly severed the wings of the diving harpy, spraying blood.</p>
<p>“Kraaak!”</p>
<p>At the screams of their comrade, the other harpies surged forward with renewed vigor. The sound of their wings grew more intense.</p>
<p>The harpies swooped down all at once above the heads of Stefan’s group. Stefan swung his sword, scattering the blood of the blade onto the ground. The elf woman, Relsia, who had been coyly flirting before, now stood behind him with a cold face, dagger in hand.</p>
<p>“Knights of Altion! Repel the enemy!”</p>
<p>With Stefan’s cry, the knights’ swords began to emit dazzling light. The harpies leading the charge were hit and fell to the ground, spraying blood. Seeing that the knights were not as easy to overcome as they thought, the harpies at the rear fiercely flapped their wings. Feathers as hard as steel shot out like arrows, overwhelming the knights.</p>
<p>Tatatat!</p>
<p>The sound of armor being crushed under the impact showed that it was no ordinary force. While the knights were blocking with their shields, Sir Edward shouted.</p>
<p>“Sir Todd!”</p>
<p>“Understood!”</p>
<p>Todd, who had pre-cast magic, stretched out his hand at the right moment.</p>
<p>“Fire Chain!”</p>
<p>Chains of fire wrapped around the harpies, igniting them in succession. The entire sky was filled with flames, turning red. Then, Sillan began chanting a prayer, bestowing the knights with the goddess’s blessing.</p>
<p>“O Philanence, grant these individuals indomitable courage!”</p>
<p>Light surrounded the knights, and their vigor surged. Regaining their strength, the knights began to push back the harpies with their shields.</p>
<p>“Taahh!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Repenhardt stood by the roadside, watching the scene with a blank expression.</p>
<p>‘Everyone seems quite skilled?’</p>
<p>Especially that youngster Stefan, his swordsmanship was better than expected. It seemed that the saying about martial arts correlating with character was a lie. After all, this was the ruin where Sir Claude, an aura user, had met his death. They wouldn’t have sent someone of mediocre ability.</p>
<p>‘But from what I see, they all seem quite clumsy.’</p>
<p>Repenhardt observed the knights anew, especially Stefan’s movements, with a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>Certainly, he was exceptional among them, a master of swordsmanship. Yet, to Repenhardt’s eyes, his entire world was full of vulnerabilities. If he set his mind to it, he felt he could take him down within 10 seconds.</p>
<p>It was Repenhardt, as a magician, who judged the skill to be quite good.</p>
<p>Everyone seemed incredibly clumsy to Repenhardt, as a martial artist.</p>
<p>‘It seems master wasn’t bragging for nothing.’</p>
<p>Of course, being the body that would become the future Fist King, Repenhardt himself did not think he was weak. From the moment he awakened his aura, comparing himself to them was unreasonable.</p>
<p>However, Repenhardt, who had never seen any warrior other than Gerard, and who had been a magician in his previous life, had no eye to accurately discern the level of his opponents. Now, for the first time, he was able to measure another warrior’s level with the eye of a ‘warrior.’ Was it the first time he truly felt his own strength, which he had only known in his mind?</p>
<p>‘Anyway…’</p>
<p>He glanced to the side. The orc slaves who had been carrying the luggage were crouching down, huddled under a tree, trembling. They looked like rabbits that had encountered an eagle. No matter how brave the race of warriors, growing up as a slave from a young age made them like this.</p>
<p>Clicking his tongue, Repenhardt scratched his cheek.</p>
<p>‘Well, no one is taking care of them.’</p>
<p>It was good to fight diligently, but those knights had completely lost interest in either the orc slaves or Repenhardt.</p>
<p>‘That’s why that hunter died.’</p>
<p>It wasn’t that these people were particularly bad, but it seemed they generally lacked the habit of taking care of others.</p>
<p>‘Well, thinking about it, that’s exactly what makes them bad, isn’t it?’</p>
<p>At that moment, Sillan, who was standing a short distance away, caught sight of Repenhardt standing idly and screamed in shock.</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous!”</p>
<p>‘He’s somewhat better.’</p>
<p>“Hide behind the tree!”</p>
<p>Following up with a series of holy spells, Sillan urgently called out. Repenhardt leisurely moved behind a tree and crouched down slightly.</p>

                        










                    </div>: "pf-11840-1"})</script></div>



                        <p>[ Chapter 15 ]</p>
<p>The harpies decided to change their attack pattern, suddenly taking to the skies and launching their feathers like arrows.</p>
<p>“Screeeeek!”</p>
<p>The steel feather arrows covered the entire field of view. Their range was so vast that it included not just the knights and Todd, Sillan, but also Repenhardt and the orc slaves.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>Though the incoming attack was clearly visible, Repenhardt deliberately chose not to move.</p>
<p>Thud, thud, thud.</p>
<p>Something lightly hit his coat and then fell off. Even attacks that could dent armor were nothing more than a light massage to him.</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>Licking his lips, Repenhardt casually threw a punch into the air. It was a short, jab-like punch, generating a gust of wind that wrapped around the feathers aimed at the orcs’ vital spots, causing all the feathers to deviate from their trajectory and miss.</p>
<p>‘Well, it hit their limbs a few times, but orcs are tough enough not to die from just that.’</p>
<p>Soon after, the area was splattered with blood as the harpies began to flee.</p>
<p>“Squeak, squeak!”</p>
<p>“Screaaaak!”</p>
<p>Putting away his sword and catching his breath, Stefan shouted.</p>
<p>“Report on the damages! Is everyone alright?”</p>
<p>Sir Edward responded heartily.</p>
<p>“The Altion Knights are still strong!”</p>
<p>Despite facing dozens of harpies, everyone appeared unscathed. A few had been grazed by the arrows, bleeding from their faces and arms, but those were merely superficial wounds.</p>
<p>Relieved, Stefan asked again.</p>
<p>“What about the mages and the clerics?”</p>
<p>“Both are safe!”</p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>With a satisfied face, Stefan sheathed his sword and then shouted exuberantly.</p>
<p>“Let’s move! We’ll find a suitable spot to rest and celebrate our victory!”</p>
<p>“Yes, My Lord!”</p>
<p>Victory always brings pleasure, no matter how trivial.</p>
<p>The morale-boosted knights all raised their swords and yelled. It was a truly exhilarating sight.</p>
<p>And Repenhardt muttered to himself,</p>
<p>“Hey, what about my safety? And the orcs are quite injured, you know?”</p>
<p>Of course, his voice was so low that none of the excited knights heard his muttering.</p>
<p>Repenhardt led Stefan and his party to a small clearing in the path. There, they took out some emergency rations and rested.</p>
<p>Todd, who had been using magic, was seen entering meditation to calm his surging magical energy. Seeing his chance, Repenhardt approached him to start a conversation.</p>
<p>“Uh………….”</p>
<p>“Hm? What is it?”</p>
<p>Todd glared at him with an unpleasant expression. Repenhardt, who had always seen Todd smiling, found this expression quite alien. Slightly flustered, Repenhardt slightly bowed his head.</p>
<p>“No, I was just trying to express my gratitude for the magician’s help earlier that saved me.”</p>
<p>Considering it, Todd hadn’t really taken care of him, so there wasn’t much to thank him for. But then again, there’s no one who feels bad about receiving gratitude. Todd’s expression eased a bit. He cleared his throat and said,</p>
<p>“Well, it’s nothing special.”</p>
<p>Seizing the moment, Repenhardt sidled up to Todd. Meeting someone he knew brought out a habit from his previous life, though Todd seemed oddly uncomfortable and avoided him. Perhaps it made sense, since Repenhardt was now a towering figure at 190 centimeters tall.</p>
<p>“By the way, I overheard that you’re affiliated with the Tower of Delphia.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, but why do you ask?”</p>
<p>“There’s someone I know there.”</p>
<p>“Someone you know?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a friend… Do you happen to know Repenhardt?”</p>
<p>It felt strange to refer to himself in the third person, but he managed his expression carefully, waiting for Todd’s response. Todd’s face softened, becoming somewhat nostalgic.</p>
<p>“Ah, Repenhardt, you say?”</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>“Did that kid have such a brutish friend?”</p>
<p>What, so pretty boys can only be friends with each other? Repenhardt was momentarily dumbfounded by Todd’s ridiculous comment but managed to keep his composure. Todd chuckled, stroking his chin.</p>
<p>“That kid. He’s really cute and kind. Heh heh heh.”</p>
<p>The laughter sounded oddly unpleasant.</p>
<p>“But why do you ask about him?”</p>
<p>“Oh, just wondering how he’s been. Nothing’s wrong, is there?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Still studying magic at the tower and doing fine. Why?”</p>
<p>It seemed the message wasn’t getting across properly. Repenhardt asked again.</p>
<p>“No, I mean, has there been any strange happenings in the last few years?”</p>
<p>“Strange happenings? Not that I’m aware of.”</p>
<p>Todd made a subtle face again. This time, Repenhardt could clearly identify it. That sly smile was the kind men often wear when they gaze at beauties!</p>
<p>“Still with a sharp nose… eyes like gems… smooth skin… He’s doing well, but why?”</p>
<p>“Any change in behavior or anything like that?”</p>
<p>“Not that I know of? I’m not really interested in what that kid thinks.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Repenhardt realized. This man, unlike Gerard, valued only physical appearances. What a guy!</p>
<p>He agonized.</p>
<p>‘Ah, my God. What should I do? Should I just beat this jerk to a pulp right here?’</p>
<p>It seemed necessary to do so, if only to protect his own chastity from his youth. He cursed himself for having trusted and treated such a person kindly, but he forced himself to endure it.</p>
<p>‘No, on second thought, he wasn’t a bad person to the extent of harming others.’</p>
<p>In his memories, Todd had never revealed any malicious intentions. He had genuinely treated Repenhardt kindly and had thoroughly hidden himself until now, when he was reborn, to the extent that he only just realized this fact. After all, one cannot be punished for having strange thoughts internally, right?</p>
<p>This made it completely impossible to know what had happened to him in the current era. He had been happy, thinking it would be easy to gather information due to the overlapping dates, but as expected, knowing the future didn’t make things any easier.</p>
<p>“Ah well, I’ll have to look into it later.”</p>
<p>He got up from his seat. He had thought it was a decent plan, but felt disheartened by the setback. As he was about to return to his seat with drooped shoulders, a refreshing voice called out to him.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, are you hurt anywhere?”</p>
<p>It was Sillan, the priest of Philanence. His face was so beautiful it could be mistaken for a woman’s, full of concern as he scanned him from head to toe.</p>
<p>“I’m not hurt. Maybe you should take care of those orcs?”</p>
<p>Repenhardt spoke formally to Sillan, as he was a cleric after all. Well, he didn’t really expect this young priest to actually take care of the orcs. But to his surprise, Sillan nodded in agreement as if it made sense.</p>
<p>“Ah, right.”</p>
<p>He then went to the groaning orcs and applied healing magic. The resting knights clicked their tongues, trying to dissuade him.</p>
<p>“Ha, priest. Those creatures heal by themselves with just a lick. Why waste your energy?”</p>
<p>Even the orcs themselves looked perplexed.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. High priest, we are not hurt.”</p>
<p>“Really, it’s okay. We are not hurt.”</p>
<p>“Just stay still.”</p>
<p>After restraining the orcs, he poured holy energy into their limbs. The muscles and skin torn by the harpies’ feathers gradually healed back to their original state. The orcs bowed their heads in gratitude.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Thank you, priest.”</p>
<p>Smiling brightly, Sillan healed the orcs completely and returned to his place. Watching him, Repenhardt clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“Tch, no doubt he’s a good person, but…”</p>
<p>Even though he was a high-ranking cleric capable of performing healing magic, it was extremely rare for someone to show kindness even to slaves. Therefore, there was no doubt about the purity of his heart.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean they treated the orcs with personal respect. Perhaps that young priest would apply his healing arts with just as much fervor if a dog, cat, or horse were injured. This isn’t about being good or bad. It’s about an absolute set of values, a way of thinking that has captivated the minds of all humanity.</p>
<p>‘Ah, we have a long way to go.’</p>
<p>Stefan seemed to share a similar thought. After urging the knights to get ready, he yelled at Repenhardt.</p>
<p>“Hey, guide! Hurry up and lead the way!”</p>
<p>Any knight worth his salt would at least feign concern and ask if anyone was hurt, but not this one. He seemed completely indifferent to anything other than guiding.</p>
<p>‘Fine, then I’ll just faithfully provide guidance. Whatever.’</p>
<p>Originally, Repenhardt intended to guide them along a safer path, avoiding monster attacks, but his plans had changed. With a sneer, he decided to stick to his original duty.</p>
<p>“Go straight, then turn left. There’s a stream ahead, so slow down.”</p>
<p>Stefan looked puzzled as they were about to set off.</p>
<p>“What’s with that odd way of speaking?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, nothing at all.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>In a barren valley swept by the cold winter wind, by a frozen stream, a group of companions lay scattered on the ground, gasping for breath.</p>
<p>“Huff… huff…”</p>
<p>Sir Edward looked over the group with labored breathing. The once proud members of the Altion Knights were now in a state of complete defeat. Their shining armor was dented and covered in dirt and dust, looking more like scrap metal.</p>
<p>“Everyone, take a rest!”</p>
<p>They had just managed to retreat here after fighting more than twenty ogres. There happened to be an ogre tribe at this particular pass.</p>
<p>Before that, they had been fighting non-stop against harpies, basilisks, dire wolves, and other powerful monsters. Even for the renowned Altion Knights, it was impossible not to be exhausted. The mage Todd and the priest Sillan were also on the verge of collapse, covered in sweat and dirt.</p>
<p>One of the knights, looking around in exasperation, muttered.</p>
<p>“Why are there so many monsters in this small mountain range?”</p>
<p>‘Because we blindly charged straight towards the ruins, that’s why.’</p>
<p>Since Stefan had openly declared, ‘Your only value is in guiding us!’, Repenhardt had decided to respect his wishes. The standard approach would have been to navigate through the habitats of the monsters to reach the ruins, but they ignored that and charged straight ahead, encountering various monsters along the way.</p>
<p>‘I didn’t lie. This was the fastest way.’</p>
<p>Of course, the delay caused by fighting monsters didn’t concern him. It wasn’t the guide’s responsibility if something happened along the way and delayed them.</p>
<p>He was a magician. Magicians, as a group, are known to be narrow-minded and petty.</p>
<p>‘It’s not like I was trying to torment you. I did exactly as I was told, didn’t I?’</p>
<p>Repenhardt, with a smirk that seemed to mock the gasping knights, casually checked on the state of the orc slaves.</p>
<p>The orcs were tired too, but unlike the knights, they still had a considerable amount of energy left. It was a natural outcome since they weren’t at the front lines of the battle but were instead hiding in the back.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, they would have all died in the battle, but thanks to Repenhardt’s discreet care, they all arrived here without so much as a scratch.</p>
<p>Even the knights were exhausted, so it would be suspicious if only the guide and the slaves were fine, but no one questioned it. It proved how indifferent these people were towards slaves and commoners.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Stefan was sitting on a rock, resting and being attended to by the elf Relsia. He was catching his breath with a pale complexion, looking across the valley.</p>
<p>“It’s indeed fitting for the place where Sir Claude met his death. To think that so many monsters lived in such a small mountain range…”</p>
<p>He was suddenly struck by the realization of how heavy his task was. It was at that moment that Stefan reaffirmed his determination for the glory of his great family.</p>
<p>“We just need to go a little further. Do you need a rest by any chance?”</p>
<p>Stefan gritted his teeth at the guide’s annoyingly healthy appearance. Although the tone was polite, it somehow sounded sarcastic, as if saying, ‘Surely a knight of your caliber wouldn’t get tired over this little ordeal?’</p>
<p>“Everyone, get up!”</p>
<p>Forcing himself up, Stefan shouted at his scattered subordinates. Knights, magicians, and a young clergyman all stood up with sickly faces. The young guide casually pointed deeper into the valley.</p>
<p>“We’re almost there. Just follow this frozen stream up.”</p>
<p>Stefan started walking, and Repenhardt smiled slightly.</p>
<p>‘Then, we should be arriving soon.’</p>
<p>There were no more monsters left to encounter in the vicinity.</p>
<p>Stefan and his party began to ascend the valley with heightened vigilance.</p>

                        










                    </div>: "pf-11840-1"})</script></div>



                        <p>[ Chapter 16 ]</p>
<p>Approximately 30 minutes later.</p>
<p>“Ah! Is this the place?”</p>
<p>Stefan exclaimed with overwhelming joy.</p>
<p>“Without a doubt, Lord Stefan.”</p>
<p>Edward added, his voice filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Before them, nestled between the narrowing valleys, stood a partially crumbled giant building. Its architecture was unlike anything from the current continent, featuring a unique shape with a diamond-like narrowing facade topped by a circular roof. The material was ordinary granite, with signs of erosion peeling off various parts of the exterior walls.</p>
<p>It was unmistakable.</p>
<p>Their destination, the resting place of the great knight, Sir Claude.</p>
<p>An ancient ruin, ‘Falton.’</p>
<p>Calming his excitement, Stefan examined the building. To the left, a semi-collapsed passage was visible. Todd closed his eyes and after a brief moment of magical incantation, he said with certainty,</p>
<p>“This is the entrance.”</p>
<p>He had sent an orb of vision sharing magic into the passage for a preliminary exploration. Urged by Sir Edward, Sillan, the cleric boy, illuminated their path with a sphere of light, and the group stepped into the passage in unison.</p>
<p>Inside was a large rectangular stone chamber. Moss filled the gaps between the bricks, and the air was humid. The walls bore various indecipherable symbols carved in relief. The chamber was quite large, roughly the size of a noble’s mansion party hall.</p>
<p>Directly opposite the entrance they used was another doorway, beyond which stretched a long corridor engulfed in ominous darkness.</p>
<p>After Todd and Sir Edward carefully inspected the interior of the chamber, they reported,</p>
<p>“This place appears to be safe, my lord.”</p>
<p>“Good, everyone get ready.”</p>
<p>Deciding to make this their base camp, they began to unpack. Orc slaves tirelessly collected thick branches, setting up simple barricades at both entrances. Relsia kindled a campfire while the knights took out jerked meat to fill their bellies and checked their equipment. Todd and Sillan also began their meditation and prayers, preparing themselves for the dungeon’s deeper exploration.</p>
<p>While watching this scene, Repenhardt approached Stefan and said,</p>
<p>“I shall wait here then.”</p>
<p>“Eh? You may return to the village now.”</p>
<p>Stefan waved his hand dismissively, puzzled. At this point, the guide’s usefulness had expired, and the gesture meant it was time for him to leave.</p>
<p>Repenhardt, with a servile smile, rubbed his hands together.</p>
<p>“No, I have no means of returning to the village by myself.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on it, they too had endured hardships to reach this point. There was no way a mere traveler could pass through. Stefan cracked a smile. Even this arrogant, burly man had come to realize the greatness of the knights!</p>
<p>Feeling good, a kind tone naturally emerged.</p>
<p>“Well then, as a reward for guiding you here, I shall protect you on your way back.”</p>
<p>Though Stefan said this as if he was offering a great kindness, Repenhardt was dumbfounded. Was this supposed to be something to be grateful for? It seemed like the fact that the guide wouldn’t have been here without them in the first place wasn’t even in his mind.</p>
<p>‘Were you not going to bring me along then? Isn’t it just basic human decency?’</p>
<p>It was a comment made out of concern that he might be suspected if he suggested leaving alone after all the trouble on the way here, but it seemed unnecessary.</p>
<p>As Repenhardt stood dumbfounded, Stefan frowned slightly. He, a knight, had offered mercy, yet it wasn’t appreciated.</p>
<p>‘Indeed, those who don’t understand honor… Tsk.’</p>
<p>Clicking his tongue, Stefan turned away. With that, he erased the existence of this guide. He then looked back at his knights, regaining their brave demeanor, and smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>Now was the time to explore the cursed ancient dungeon with these brave knights. The vision of retrieving the magic sword Altion and triumphantly returning to the capital came to mind.</p>
<p>Stefan drew his sword and exclaimed valiantly.</p>
<p>“Within lies a great being. It is our duty to continue their legacy!”</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>Though he wasn’t sure what made the pompous dead so great, the knights dutifully responded to his speech.</p>
<p>“Let’s go, brave knights of Altion!”</p>
<p>Stefan rushed down the corridor. Relsia, Edward, and the other knights followed enthusiastically. Todd and Sillan moved with indifferent faces, assuming these were just their natural dispositions, and the orc slaves also prepared for dungeon exploration, carrying necessary supplies on their shoulders towards the chamber.</p>
<p>“Take care~.”</p>
<p>Repenhardt kindly saw them off as they entered the chamber. As their footsteps faded, he stretched.</p>
<p>“Well, now it’s time for me to see to my own business.”</p>
<p>The ancient ruins, Falton, was originally a logistics base used during the Silver Age. Now, spanning dimensions, it has turned into a den teeming with various monsters and undead, but during the Silver Age, it was just one of the ordinary military buildings.</p>
<p>Of course, all the tools used during the Silver Age are now considered miraculous relics by today’s standards of demonology, so their value shouldn’t be underestimated just because they were considered ordinary back then.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s really been a long time.”</p>
<p>Surveying his surroundings, Repenhardt murmured with a face filled with nostalgia. It was he who had proposed the theory that this place was a logistics base. Through his exploration, understanding more than half of the defense system through the power of strong magic, this was the conclusion he had reached.</p>
<p>In the past, he had explored this place with Siris, just the two of them. It had been a happy time. He remembered the precious moments they shared, even amidst the tension.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the illusion of a beautiful elf woman appeared before him.</p>
<p>Her voice, chirping like a small bird, was vivid in his ears. She, who could command the spirits of the wind, easily found the secret passages that appeared to be mere walls to others.</p>
<p>“Ugh…….”</p>
<p>Somehow, reminiscing had led him into territory not suitable for minors. Repenhardt shook his head. Now wasn’t the time for such thoughts.</p>
<p>‘Ah, but what on earth was I doing with Siris in the middle of this dangerous dungeon? I was a brave one, wasn’t I.’</p>
<p>‘Just wait a little longer. Siris, I’ll come to meet you soon.’</p>
<p>Repenhardt caressed a stone wall engraved with symbols.</p>
<p>‘Surely, it was based on the scales of Libra, with the signs of Aqua and Terra inversely mixed to encrypt it, right?’</p>
<p>This pattern engraved on the wall was called ‘Destin’, a script from the Silver Age. In the past, Repenhardt had learned all the languages of every race on the continent, including ancient scripts like Destin, Ralfin, Pestal, and Alcata. Of course, it used to take him more than half a day to decipher them…</p>
<p>‘Now, it’s as if I’m holding the answer sheet.’</p>
<p>Without hesitation, Repenhardt moved the tiles embedded in the wall. Part of the pattern on the wall smoothly slid aside.</p>
<p>‘It’s tougher than I remembered.’</p>
<p>While he remembered everything, actually moving the tiles was difficult. Most of the defense systems from the Silver Age don’t easily operate without magical power. He summoned all the magical power he had, and where it fell short, he compensated with physical strength, grunting as he moved the tiles.</p>
<p>After several attempts at manipulating the tiles, the wall’s pattern, which naturally formed a certain design, transformed into an entirely new pattern.</p>
<p>“Ah, there it is.”</p>
<p>The wall trembled, and dust poured down. This was the real passageway to the relics of Falton that Todd had never known, discovered by Repenhardt himself.</p>
<p>With a deeply moved expression, he watched the scene unfold.</p>
<p>“Ha ha ha…….”</p>
<p>The door to secrets hidden for thousands of years was now opening.</p>
<p>Standing before the passage, Repenhardt first shed his scarf and fur coat. Considering the battle ahead, it would be unwise to treat the clothing he bought with ten silver coins roughly. It seemed silly to fret over the cost of a coat when he could soon earn money aplenty.</p>
<p>‘There’s no need to deliberately throw away good clothes, right? It’s not like I’m going to catch a cold if I don’t wear them.’</p>
<p>Thus, in his modest attire of just a simple vest and trousers, he warmed up his body lightly. Now was the time to test the capabilities of his body, which had endured so much over the past six years!</p>
<p>As Repenhardt was getting into high spirits,</p>
<p>“AAAAAH!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a faint scream came from the darkness beyond. It was a small sound, barely discernible even to him, whose hearing had improved, coming from far away.</p>
<p>“Huh?” Wondering if he had heard wrong, Repenhardt unconsciously tilted his head. The scream sounded familiar. It seemed like it might be Todd’s voice…</p>
<p>“AAH! AHH! AAAAH!”</p>
<p>The screams continued, this time it seemed to be Sillan and that fellow named Edward.</p>
<p>‘Why am I hearing the screams of those who went that way, from over here?’</p>
<p>Baffled, he stared blankly at the passage in front of him.</p>
<p>‘Hold on. What was this passage again? It was originally a logistics base from the era of silver. And this secret passage directly connects to the third basement, right? And if that back door is opened, it means some kind of intrusion is happening…’</p>
<p>He remembered. The logistics base meant it was used for military purposes. And in the event of an intrusion, the remnants of the Falton magic system would mobilize all means to repel the intruders. Yes, it had been the same in the past.</p>
<p>‘And that’s when all the secret traps of the ruins were activated at once, right?’</p>
<p>“Oh no.”</p>
<p>Repenhardt finally realized the mistake he had made. Opening the door as he had in the past was fine, but he had forgotten that the situation was different now. Back then, it was just Siris and him, so it didn’t matter whether the traps on the first and second basements of Falton were activated. But now, Todd and his group were there, weren’t they?</p>
<p>It was clear they had all fallen into a trap and dropped together into the second basement level in harmony. Otherwise, how could their voices be heard so oddly from this direction?</p>
<p>“Damn…”</p>
<p>Repenhardt clicked his tongue. No matter how much he thought about it, it seemed impossible for that group to handle the monsters on the second basement level with their current strength.</p>
<p>The danger levels between the first basement floor and the second and third floors of Falton were entirely different dimensions. And if Todd’s recollection was accurate, the area they explored was just the first basement level. They returned without even seeing the shadow of the demon sword Altion, having only collected a few artifacts. It was only after several more expeditions by the House of Altion that the second basement level was discovered and the sword was recovered. That story was set to unfold 5 or 6 years later.</p>
<p>“I’ve made a mistake. Tsk.”</p>
<p>Repenhardt scratched his cheek, feeling a prick of conscience. Well, even though he had been called a Demon Lord in his previous life, Repenhardt prided himself on living conscientiously. He did not find it pleasant to be the cause of someone else’s death.</p>
<p>Honestly, he wasn’t particularly fond of those arrogant knights, so he wouldn’t feel much guilt if they died there… Besides, after meeting Todd again, he realized he wasn’t someone he wanted to save either…</p>
<p>‘But if that young priest and innocent slaves were to die, I’d have restless dreams, wouldn’t I?’</p>
<p>This won’t do.</p>
<p>Repenhardt lightly rolled his foot, propelling himself forward with his trained body’s astonishing leap. Grumbling, he disappeared into the darkness of the passage in an instant.</p>
<p>“Ah, things have gotten seriously tangled.”</p>

                        










                    </div>: "pf-11840-1"})</script></div>



                        <p>[ Chapter 17 ]</p>
<p>A streak of light pierced the darkness, flying forth.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>A scream echoed down the narrow stone chamber corridor. Red blood splattered across the stone walls, sticky and trailing down. The source of the flash was a sharp, red scythe. The knight who had spilled blood now clutched his shoulder, staggering backward.</p>
<p>“Sir Thomas!”</p>
<p>The other knights erupted in an impassioned cry at their companion’s injury. Yet, none dared to bravely shield their colleague with a shield. The enemy before them was too terrifying, too fearsome.</p>
<p>The knights looked forward in despair. A wicked laughter echoed as a monster from another realm approached from the end of the corridor.</p>
<p>“Kekekeke..”</p>
<p>With a towering height of 2 meters, covered in twisted muscles and a red body, its vile mouth was surrounded by yellow flames. Its empty eyes were as dark as abysses, showing endless darkness. This demon, known as Beiter, was rumored to possess twenty times the strength and power of a human. It was now pressing towards them with four arms, each wielding a sword, scythe, or axe.</p>
<p>One of the knights screamed out in desperation.</p>
<p>“Ah! How can a human ever stand against such a demon!”</p>
<p>‘Wow, that tone really stuck to him deep.’</p>
<p>Sillan couldn’t help but stick out his tongue at the sight of the Altion knight, whose ancient way of speaking naturally slipped out even in a state of utter fear.</p>
<p>‘Eek, now’s not the time to be having such random thoughts.’</p>
<p>Sillan shook her head and moved towards the fallen Sir Thomas. She placed her hand on his shoulder and prayed.</p>
<p>“Philanence, may your healing light dwell within.”</p>
<p>True to the goddess of love, a pink(!) holy light surged, beginning to mend the wounds. Bones and muscles knitted together at an astonishing rate. Such rapid healing was rare even within the Philanence clergy. Despite his young age, he was a high-ranking cleric. Sir Thomas, now relieved of pain, expressed his gratitude.</p>
<p>“Thank you, cleric.”</p>
<p>‘There’s no need to thank me. If you died, I’d be next, wouldn’t I?’</p>
<p>Despite his inner thoughts, Sillan smiled benevolently. His demeanor was linked to the church’s reputation, so in any case, he could not afford to lose the image of a priest. This seemingly pretty and kind young cleric actually had quite a cunning side.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>Sir Thomas, now back on his feet, wielding his sword and shield, let out a wild scream. He forcibly shouts to muster courage from nowhere. Yet, his feet remained frozen, still seized by fear. Sillan bit her nails secretly.</p>
<p>‘Damn, it seemed easy at the beginning…’</p>
<p>In the beginning, it wasn’t too difficult. True to the dungeon’s reputation, various monsters and mutated beasts appeared, but they were within manageable levels. The monsters were low-tier demons like Kavi Beach or Grellin, and the mutated beasts were nothing more than giant rats or bugs, with a few skeletons creaking as they attacked. He wondered why Sir Claude, who could handle this level of ruin, had died.</p>
<p>The situation changed when they passed through about three passages and entered a round chamber.</p>
<p>-Kel Hain Speratachcana!</p>
<p>With a strange voice, the doors on either side of the chamber closed, and suddenly the floor collapsed. More accurately, it opened up, but for those experiencing it, the difference was negligible.</p>
<p>Screaming, Stefan and his party free-fell about ten meters down. If Todd hadn’t quickly cast a spell to form a soft layer of air on the ground, the lightweight elf and knights might have been fine, but Sillan and the orc slaves would have certainly fallen to their deaths.</p>
<p>That’s when the real hell began. Monsters of a completely different caliber appeared, and Stefan’s party desperately fled to the opposite passage, only to be forced to keep fleeing. After about ten minutes, they were eventually surrounded by demons approaching from both sides of the passage.</p>
<p>“Growl…”</p>
<p>“Grroar…”</p>
<p>The chilling breaths of demons could be heard from both sides.</p>
<p>“Heltro!”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a Beiter screamed, and dozens of ghouls burst out from the ground around him. The hideous ghouls with their sharp claws made the knights scream in terror as they charged.</p>
<p>Mixed groans escaped.</p>
<p>“Monsters!”</p>
<p>“Oh! My God!”</p>
<p>Sillan clenched her teeth and prayed again.</p>
<p>“Philanence, strike down this misguided being with your hammer of light!”</p>
<p>Surprisingly, Sillan was quite composed. Indeed, it’s more than just composure when one can finish a prayer without blinking an eye as blade-like claws thrust before them.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A pink-colored hammer of light appeared out of nowhere and smashed one of the ghouls. Although its color was peculiar, its divine power was undeniable. After dealing with one ghoul, Sillan quickly turned to the knights.</p>
<p>“Aaaah~”</p>
<p>The knights were clumsily fighting off other ghouls. Given their skills, they should have easily defeated these ghouls, but they were only defending with their shields, continuously retreating in panic.</p>
<p>‘Already lost your nerve? I’m still fine. What a waste of muscles.’</p>
<p>Despite their impressive stature, their spirits were notably frail. A sigh escaped internally, yet they were cherished shields that couldn’t be left to shatter. Sillan raised her hands high, praying to the goddess.</p>
<p>“Philanence, grant them the courage of the indomitable!”</p>
<p>A spiritual divine spell, imbuing strength and courage, was cast upon the knights. Nevertheless, they hesitated, overwhelmed by fear, rendering the spell ineffective.</p>
<p>Biting down, Sillan prayed once more with determination.</p>
<p>“Philanence, generously bestow upon them the courage of the indomitable!”</p>
<p>The prayer might have sounded odd, but the efficacy of divine spells depended on the cleric’s faith, not their eloquence.</p>
<p>Finally, the knights launched a fierce counterattack.</p>
<p>“Aaargh!”</p>
<p>They became berserkers, overly empowered by divine force, eyes bulging and drooling as they slaughtered ghouls – a sight reminiscent of severe hallucinogen overdose. It seemed the goddess had taken “generously” a bit too literally.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, the situation improved. Sir Edward, empowered, led the charge against the ghouls, shouting,</p>
<p>“Brave knights of Altion, show these vile beasts our courage!”</p>
<p>Wielding a massive bastard sword, Sir Edward charged at the demon.</p>
<p>The demon roared, flailing its four arms, but Edward, an experienced knight, either dodged or blocked with his shield, engaging the demon closely.</p>
<p>“Sephir Dei Crotel, Earth, extend thy hand and reclaim what originated from thee! Iron Steel!”</p>
<p>Todd swiftly cast the fourth-circle spell, Iron Steel, increasing the weight of metal to disarm opponents. The spell hit the demon’s weapon. Since Beiters are resistant to magic, targeting the weapon they held was strategic.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>The Beiters dropped their weapons, momentarily confused. Seizing the opportunity, Relsia, fighting from across the passage, moved behind the demon.</p>
<p>Whish!</p>
<p>Without a sound, her longsword deeply slashed the demon’s wing joint. The demon, enraged, swung back.</p>
<p>“Kyaaak!”</p>
<p>Relsia was hurled against the far wall. Even so, she smiled faintly, seeing her beloved master advancing into the demon’s grasp.</p>
<p>“Did I assist you, master…?”</p>
<p>“Well done, Relsia!”</p>
<p>Seizing the moment, Stefan delivered a sharp strike with his sword, shouting,</p>
<p>“Taat!”</p>
<p>The blade pierced through Beiter’s four forearms in a single breath, and then it swiftly changed its trajectory to execute a diagonal slashing in an X pattern from left to right. A deep X-shaped wound was carved into the demon’s chest, causing demonic blood to spurt out. This was the Shooting Cross, a technique designed to disrupt the opponent’s balance and deliver a fatal blow.</p>
<p>It was the secret sword technique of the Altion family that had earned Stefan the title of ‘Knight of Determination.’</p>
<p>The Beiter screamed and fell to the ground. That a human could defeat such a demon! The knights exclaimed in amazement.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>“Indeed, Lord Stefan!”</p>
<p>“Truly, the Knight of Determination!”</p>
<p>However, Stefan’s expression upon landing was anything but bright. In his eyes, he could clearly see another demon approaching from the dark corridor.</p>
<p>“These filthy demons!”</p>
<p>He shouted as he charged at the demon again. Blood and screams spread everywhere.</p>
<p>The nightmare was endless. Inspired by Stefan’s struggle, Sir Edward and the other knights managed to defeat another Beiter, but their courage was immediately shattered by the appearance of another, more formidable demon.</p>
<p>This time, it was a Tagrel, a higher-ranking and massive demon even larger than a Beiter, standing at 2.5 meters tall with the strength to crush rocks and a metallic flesh impervious to blades. This monstrosity, bearing flames in its arms, charged at the knights.</p>
<p>The burning, murderous intent constricted around them. All the knights trembled in fear. Sillan once again bestowed courage upon them with her holy power, but this time it had no effect. Just as frequent use of drugs diminishes their efficacy, so too does the frequent use of holy spells.</p>
<p>“Pull yourselves together! This is where the great knight, Lord Claude, fell. Didn’t you prepare yourselves for a challenging battle? Are you not the brave knights of Altion?”</p>
<p>The stern rebuke of the commander inadvertently led the knights to start swinging their swords at the Tagrel. It was more of a reflexive action than a surge of courage.</p>
<p>“KROOOO!”</p>
<p>Enraged, the Tagrel began to spew flames at the knights.</p>
<p>A demon with red skin from hell, bearing flames in its hands and feet, charged at them. Their swords could not tear through its thick hide. Even if they swung their fists or raised their shields, the shields would be smashed to pieces.</p>
<p>Todd’s magic was also ineffective. Though he was a high-level mage, the Tagrel’s magical resistance was too high. No spell could penetrate the demon’s anti-magic field.</p>
<p>“AAAAAH!”</p>
<p>Eventually, a knight screamed as he was slammed into a wall. His head was completely embedded, and blood streamed from between his armor; it was a clear case of instant death, no matter how one looked at it.</p>
<p>Sillan was terrified this time as well.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>People were dying before his eyes. Another knight, who had been aiming for the Tagrel from behind, was engulfed in flames and burnt to death. The Tagrel’s punch buried the knight’s head into his body, causing a fountain of blood to spray out.</p>
<p>It was horrifying. Truly a scene from hell.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Todd was crouched in a corner like the orc slaves, holding his head and covering his eyes and ears. He was shivering, clearly in a state of escapism. Despite his extensive experience in exploring ruins, he had never encountered such a powerful monster before.</p>
<p>Being a mage proud of his magic, he fell into panic even quicker than ordinary people upon meeting an opponent against whom his magic was utterly ineffective.</p>
<p>“Damn it, damn it, damn!”</p>
<p>Bleeding, Stefan cursed repeatedly. In no time, three knights had been turned into mere spirits without leaving bodies behind. Sir Edward, who had charged first, was sent flying with a punch and lay far away, too distant to check if he was alive or dead.</p>
<p>Despite such heavy losses, the devil in front of them did not have a single scratch. The sense of helplessness in the face of his subordinates’ deaths tore at his pride unbearably.</p>
<p>This couldn’t go on.</p>
<p>They couldn’t just be defeated like this!</p>
<p>“I am the one who carries on the name of Altion…”</p>
<p>Stefan gripped his sword tighter. His face was filled with determination.</p>
<p>“I am the one who has earned the title of Determination!”</p>
<p>Stefan’s figure rushed towards the Tagrel with astonishing speed. The Altion family’s strongest secret technique, the Shooting Strike, concentrated all the body’s elasticity into a single piercing thrust, pouring towards Tagrel like a flash of light. And then…</p>
<p>Thwack!</p>
<p>The Tagrel ‘determinedly’ swatted away Stefan as he flew at him. The expensive armor, mixed with mithril, shattered as Stefan was pitifully flung away. He hit the wall and then the floor, before falling into silence.</p>
<p>Sillan inwardly cursed.</p>
<p>‘No, why on earth did he start with such a big technique!?’</p>
<p>Martial arts is supposed to be about the ‘process’ of checking and countering the opponent within the offense and defense. Ignoring that and just hurling your body from the start, how is one supposed to do anything? It’s blatantly obvious where he’s aiming from!</p>

                        <p>[ Chapter 18 ]</p>
<p>“Krrrr…….”</p>
<p>The Tagrel turned its head, breathing out a breath of flames. It seemed it’d finished dealing with the bothersome knights and was now aiming to dispose of Todd, Sillan, and the remaining orc slaves.</p>
<p>“O, Philanence, with your light, obliterate this malevolent being!”</p>
<p>In a state of terror, Sillan desperately summoned his holy power. A pink holy radiance struck the Tagrel squarely, but the flames wrapping around its body soon swallowed up the holy light, burning even more fiercely.</p>
<p>“Kaaa!”</p>
<p>A demonic roar tore through the air, shaking the very ground. Sillan trembled violently, his mind going blank as he stumbled backward until his back hit a wall.</p>
<p>“Aaaaah…”</p>
<p>As the demon approached, Sillan’s eyes widened in terror, facing the imminent threat.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A booming sound was followed by a gust of wind, causing Sillan’s hair to flutter chaotically. He involuntarily closed his eyes.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes again, a dark silhouette stood between him and the demon. Surprised, Sillan blinked, and a vast entity shielded her like a rampart.</p>
<p>‘What, what is that?’</p>
<p>It was the back of a huge, reliably sturdy man.</p>
<p>“Hooo…….”</p>
<p>Repenhardt caught his breath. He had rushed over so quickly that even his well-trained body was gasping for air. Trying to avoid traps and evade monsters’ gaze had required more movement than necessary.</p>
<p>The Tagrel, caught off guard by his sudden appearance, retracted its attack and took a step back. In that short time, Repenhardt quickly assessed the condition of his companions.</p>
<p>Stefan and the other knights were scattered around like dented cans, and the elf woman lay limp like a broken doll. Todd, Sillan, and the orc slaves seemed unharmed, albeit half out of their senses.</p>
<p>‘Sigh, it’s as bad as I expected…’</p>
<p>Sillan’s surprised voice came from behind him.</p>
<p>“A, are you the guide, sir?”</p>
<p>Adding a title to simply calling him a guide turned it into a rather odd honorific.</p>
<p>‘Come to think of it, I haven’t given them my name. Well, no one asked.’</p>
<p>Waving his hand dismissively to keep him back, Repenhardt then focused on the demon before him.</p>
<p>An abyssal demon from another world, Tagrel.</p>
<p>‘How do I defeat this one again?’</p>
<p>He quickly sifted through his memories. Normally, dealing with demons required the holy spells of a priest, or if not that, life-based magic or even necromancy would be most effective. Of course, Repenhardt, in his prime, had mastered both to the extreme, so a demon or two was nothing. But….</p>
<p>Repenhardt, with a deliberate grip of his fist and stance, wasn’t exactly tense. Having seen other aura users easily handle beings like a Tagrel, he wasn’t worried about being overpowered.</p>
<p>However, this was his first real test as a martial artist. Complacency was not an option.</p>
<p>“Kaaaa!”</p>
<p>The Tagrel, hesitating only momentarily, charged again to repel the intruder. Recalling his spar with Gerard, Repenhardt carefully deflected the demon’s punch with his right forearm. Just in case, he drew out his aura to execute the ultimate guard skill, Spiral Guard.</p>
<p>Wooong!</p>
<p>A golden aura swirled, blocking the demon’s punch, but it didn’t repel it.</p>
<p>Crrrrick!</p>
<p>“Kaaak!”</p>
<p>With a desperate scream, the swirling aura shredded the Tagrel’s fist down to its forearm! Blood and flesh burst out in all directions, filling the air with a dense mist of blood.</p>
<p>“Cough!?”</p>
<p>Repenhardt was stunned. He had merely intended to block, but who would have imagined such a brutal outcome? Had his master really taught him such a ferocious method under the guise of defense? Despite his shock, Repenhardt instinctively landed a punch on the Tagrel’s vacant face. It was a reflex, honed over more than six years of grueling training, that responded to any vulnerability it detected.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>With a terrifying burst, the Tagrel’s upper body vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>“… Eh?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just crushed; it was obliterated. Being his first time, Repenhardt had earnestly, with the mindset of hitting Gerard (who was similarly sized), thrown his punch with all his might, resulting in excessive destructive power.</p>
<p>Silence filled the dark corridor. The Tagrel’s body, now missing its upper half, teetered and then collapsed to the floor. Repenhardt looked down at his fist with a dazed expression.</p>
<p>“Ha ha…….”</p>
<p>He was appalled. He had become a monster beyond his own understanding. The realization dawned on him that he must be exceedingly careful when dealing with humans in the future. It was a relief that his opponent was a creature from another world; otherwise, he might have accidentally earned a reputation as a legendary murderer.</p>
<p>‘So, this is why I nearly died from a single punch by Teslon…’</p>
<p>Recalling his past death, Repenhardt shook his head. As he did so, he sensed movement from the other end of the corridor. Other monsters from the dungeon, alerted by the presence of an intruder, were converging on their location.</p>
<p>‘It’s time to move them to safety.’</p>
<p>Repenhardt glanced at the orc slave and then positioned himself again. Soon, demons began to emerge and attack. Wrapped in a golden aura, Repenhardt also began to fight back.</p>
<p>Sillan just stared blankly at Repenhardt’s battle.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe his eyes. The young man brutally crushing numerous demons before him was undoubtedly the nameless traveler who had volunteered to guide them. He was someone he had barely spoken to and hadn’t paid much attention to.</p>
<p>But to think he was such a formidable warrior!</p>
<p>A demon bared its teeth and charged viciously. Grabbing the oncoming opponent by the neck, Repenhardt effortlessly twisted it and tore it off.</p>
<p>Leaping through the fountain of blood, he struck down on the next demon’s collarbone. The steel body, which remained unflinching even as the knights stabbed at it, crumbled like cheese and split in two.</p>
<p>“Kraaaak!”</p>
<p>A demon roared, emitting flames. Yet, those infernal flames could not scorch Repenhardt’s flesh. As if the blaze were merely an illusion, he effortlessly moved through the flames. Naturally, his shirt, being mere fabric, caught fire. Repenhardt, thinking it was a good decision to come without his coat, tore off the burning garment and threw it away, revealing his well-toned, tanned muscles.</p>
<p>“Hyup!”</p>
<p>With a short yell, Repenhardt delivered a simple front kick to the demon’s abdomen. The demon was sent flying backward, crashing into the wall as if it had been hit by a battering ram. The corridor shook, and dust filled the air.</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>Sillan watched the battle unfold before his eyes with admiration, awe, and longing. Another demon grabbed Repenhardt’s arm with its thick forearms. At that moment, his biceps and triceps bulged like steel, and he lifted the demon with one arm. Then, he slammed it to the ground with force! With a firm stomp on the head of the defeated demon, its skull burst open, filling with pools of blood.</p>
<p>Truly, there was no other way to describe it than astonishing. It was like watching a god of war, valiant and brutal in battle. And that massive musculature, honed without a hint of faltering!</p>
<p>“Wow…!”</p>
<p>Even those distinct six-pack abs seemed capable of chewing up a blade. This was not a figurative expression, but literally what Repenhardt did, grabbing a demon’s blade between his abs and snapping it in two. It was a technique he had picked up when he was tightly bound and thrown into a pit of bones. Among the teachings of Gym Unbreakable, there truly was a method to crush teeth with muscles.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>Perhaps due to a sudden relaxation of tension, the admiration that Sillan had only felt internally slipped out. However, Sillan didn’t realize his own mistake. The boy was simply too captivated by the muscular young man before him.</p>
<p>Pulsating muscles, delicate tendons, broad shoulders, and a physique as solid as a spire.</p>
<p>Sillan muttered with a dazed face.</p>
<p>“So big………… and beautiful………….”</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>Suddenly feeling a chill, Repenhardt turned around in surprise. He had felt all sorts of presences since he began to train his body, but this was the first time he felt something so peculiar. What kind of monstrous creature appeared to give off such a sensation?</p>
<p>But when he actually turned around, there was no demon, only a boy with a flushed face making a strange expression.</p>
<p>‘Ugh! Why does that kid look like that?’</p>
<p>In an instant, Repenhardt shuddered as if ants were crawling all over his body. He didn’t know why, but somehow, he felt unpleasantly disturbed. Maybe, it was the innocent-looking boy with flushed cheeks who seemed more terrifying than the demons he was used to facing?</p>
<p>Well, it was clear that Sillan had uttered something that could easily be misunderstood. That didn’t mean he had a different sexual preference. It was purely, genuinely, just admiration for Repenhardt’s overwhelmingly masculine physique.</p>
<p>Sillan Phil Marcis.</p>
<p>This boy, a high priest of the Philanence Order, lost his parents at a young age and was fortunately taken in by the order’s orphanage where he spent his childhood. Due to his frail and feminine appearance from a young age, he was often teased by the other orphans.</p>
<p>However, contrary to his appearance, young Sillan was quite the tough character. If hit once, he would strike back twice; if hit twice, he would bite and cling on three times, possessing the nature of a venomous snake.</p>
<p>Thanks to his temperament, Sillan was able to spend a relatively peaceful childhood. And then, he entered his teens, a time when everyone harbors dreams for their future. Like most orphans in the order, Sillan dreamed of becoming a priest serving Philanence. However, his dream was slightly different from that of other boys.</p>
<p>Having grown up constantly being told he looked like a girl, Sillan dreamed of becoming a monk within the order, demonstrating faith through physical strength.</p>
<p>A masculine physique, hearty laughter, a deep voice—all of which he did not possess. Indeed, within the love and beauty-oriented Philanence Order, the status of monks was quite low (for they were not considered beautiful!), but to young Sillan, they were the epitome of his ideals.</p>
<p>However, everyone faces challenges during their growth spurt.</p>
<p>Entering puberty, it is natural for boys to grow taller, their skeletons to enlarge, and their bodies to become more robust. Some even start to grow facial hair a bit earlier.</p>
<p>But even when all the other children became men and went through puberty, Sillan remained the same. With a slender and soft physique, a high-pitched voice, he still looked just like a beautiful maiden.</p>
<p>Eventually, at the age of 12, Sillan demonstrated his aptitude for divine power and was admitted to the Philanence Order as an apprentice priest. Having received the hierarchy’s blessing, he became the envy of all the orphans. While everyone else was celebrating and happy for him, Sillan felt despondent and cried in secret. The path to becoming a monk, which he had long dreamed of, seemed impossibly distant.</p>
<p>However, despite his young age, Sillan did not dwell in despair. Hadn’t the goddess herself said? The world rewards those who strive.</p>
<p>He had a proactive personality. He believed that if he worked hard enough, he would eventually transform into the muscular, manly physique he desired.</p>
<p>Whenever he had the chance, he secretly watched the monks train. He diligently observed and learned their muscle training routines.</p>
<p>And he followed what he learned. Despite his frail body, he devoted himself to muscle training with all his might. Every day, he trained his muscles, and whenever his body broke down, he healed himself with divine power and continued to overtrain.</p>
<p>After five years, indeed, the goddess had not spoken in vain. His efforts were rewarded, albeit not in the way he had hoped.</p>
<p>Instead of the muscles he so desired, it was his divine power, honed desperately every day, that had grown immensely. This was the not-so-secret secret behind Sillan becoming a high-ranking clergyman at the tender age of a teenager.</p>
<p>Then, Sillan’s eyes caught sight of a physique that surpassed even the monks he had observed until now, a perfect body that dwarfed all others. Sillan, who had always gazed enviously upon others’ muscles, lacked muscles himself but had developed an eye for recognizing strength and perfection. He immediately recognized how powerful and perfect Repenhardt’s physique was. It was impossible not to be captivated.</p>
<p>Of course, Repenhardt was entirely unaware of Sillan’s long history. Naturally, it left him feeling somewhat uneasy.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Repenhardt had been engrossed in testing the might of the martial arts he had been refining, lost in the excitement of honing his skills. The fact that he had been somewhat recklessly exuberant was true. But upon catching that gaze, he felt a chill run down his spine, cooling his head.</p>
<p>He clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“Ugh, a mage must always remain calm. What a disgrace this is.”</p>
<p>Although unintentional, Sillan ended up assisting Repenhardt. With his composure regained, Repenhardt began to decisively eliminate the remaining demons with efficient movements.</p>

                        










                    
                        <div></div>

                        <p>[ Chapter 19 ]</p>
<p>After dealing with the demons, Repenhardt led the group towards a safe zone.</p>
<p>There weren’t supposed to be any designated safe areas within the dungeon, yet there were certainly zones where the flow of dimensional currents twisted in such a way that monsters hesitated to approach. Repenhardt, who had already mastered all the systems of this place, Falton, easily found a nearby safe location.</p>
<p>Carrying the unconscious Todd and Sir Edward, with three orc slaves each transporting Stefan and the two surviving knights, they entered a chamber. After laying the injured down and lighting a fire to warm up, the knights began to awaken one by one.</p>
<p>“Ugh… Where are we?”</p>
<p>Sir Edward, being robust, was the first to rise and look around. Sillan quickly explained what had happened.</p>
<p>“Wow!”</p>
<p>Sir Edward exclaimed in admiration, looking at Repenhardt with new eyes. Wrapped in layers of clothing, Repenhardt had initially seemed merely well-built, but now, it was clear that his entire body was trained to the extreme, far from ordinary.</p>
<p>“I failed to recognize such a skilled warrior. May I ask your name?”</p>
<p>Repenhardt, who was resting and tearing into a piece of jerky, looked indifferently at the middle-aged knight.</p>
<p>“My name? Repen…”</p>
<p>He was about to reveal his name but then remembered he had already told Todd. It was bound to arouse suspicion. He slyly trailed off.</p>
<p>“… .”</p>
<p>Although he ended in a casual tone, it was so natural that Sir Edward did not catch any sense of discomfort. He tried to recall any fighters from the Vasily Kingdom with that name.</p>
<p>‘Repen…?’</p>
<p>He had never heard of a fighter named Repen. A true strongman’s name would be known, wouldn’t it?</p>
<p>Then, Stefan, regaining consciousness, groaned.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Sitting down, Stefan held his head. His skull still rang from the impact of flying and crashing into a stone wall. It was impossible for him not to be affected by such a forceful embrace with the wall, enough to shatter mithril alloy armor. The fact that he wasn’t gravely injured already proved how well-trained a knight he was.</p>
<p>“Lord Stefan!”</p>
<p>“Ah, Sir Edward. What has happened?”</p>
<p>After Edward helped him up and explained the situation, Stefan, with a grim expression, asked Repenhardt.</p>
<p>“May I inquire about your family name?”</p>
<p>“Family name? I don’t have such a thing.”</p>
<p>“… Were you a commoner?”</p>
<p>Stefan’s expression twisted even more at the realization that the man was not a noble warrior on a quest but merely a savage. The disgrace of a noble knight receiving aid from a savage was unthinkable.</p>
<p>Shame and confusion followed. It was inconceivable for a commoner with no noble lineage to properly receive the teachings of the great warriors. Yet, this man had single-handedly defeated demons that they themselves had struggled with?</p>
<p>‘It seems he merely finished off the demon that we had almost defeated.’</p>
<p>Stefan glanced at Sillan, assessing the situation. The young cleric boy couldn’t possibly have the discernment to truly understand and estimate martial prowess. To him, a clumsy punch or kick must have seemed like divine intervention, especially after being saved from the brink of death. The demons that appeared later must have been of lower rank.</p>
<p>In Stefan’s mind, the Tagrel had become just another demon that they had almost defeated. Satisfied with this conclusion, his expression softened.</p>
<p>“It seems you had some skill after all. Your assistance was appreciated.”</p>
<p>Though to Stefan it was an acknowledgment of gratitude, Repenhardt saw it differently.</p>
<p>Naturally, his response was curt.</p>
<p>“It seems you lacked even that bit of skill.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Stefan bristled at the response, despite offering thanks. He reached for his waist, then remembered. His sword had flown off during the earlier skirmish with the Tagrel.</p>
<p>Hesitating, Sir Edward intervened.</p>
<p>“Insolence! Show respect to the Altion Marquis house!”</p>
<p>Repenhardt, tearing into a piece of jerky, paid them no mind. The thought of them possibly attacking out of frustration crossed his mind, but he was unconcerned.</p>
<p>‘After all, this body can deflect swords.’</p>
<p>Yet, Sir Edward was not so unreasonable as to attack a benefactor. He was indeed a man of decent character.</p>
<p>Sir Edward turned to Stefan, trying to soothe him.</p>
<p>“How could a savage know proper manners? Please, be patient.”</p>
<p>The issue was that these “manners” were by the standards of knights.</p>
<p>“Regardless, did he not offer us assistance?”</p>
<p>Grunting, Stefan turned away. Reflecting on Sir Edward’s words, he realized they were true. After calming down, he decided to ‘forgive’ the savage in front of him.</p>
<p>“Ignorance is not a sin. Given your contribution, I will generously forgive your rudeness.”</p>
<p>“…… Do as you will.”</p>
<p>Stefan bristled again, but Repenhardt ignored him. Honestly, having seen his fair share of arrogant nobles in his previous life, Repenhardt was not particularly angered. And if he were to be honest with himself…</p>
<p>‘I was like that at his age, too.’</p>
<p>When a young talent is constantly praised, it’s inevitable that they become arrogant. Repenhardt himself had been insufferably proud until he matured. Who was he to judge?</p>
<p>‘He’ll grow out of it eventually.’</p>
<p>Or not. It wasn’t his problem. Why should he care? They’ll live their lives as they see fit.</p>
<p>Stefan, seemingly no longer interested in associating with Repenhardt, walked away towards where Relsia was. On the other hand, Sir Edward continued to show interest in this traveler. With his experience as a knight, he could tell that Repenhardt’s physique wasn’t just the result of mere labor.</p>
<p>“Without a family, then. Could you tell me who taught you?”</p>
<p>“I just picked things up here and there.”</p>
<p>Repenhardt deliberately hid Gerard’s name. Gerard’s reputation was too high, and attracting undue attention before regaining his magical powers was best avoided. Moreover…</p>
<p>‘I don’t want that man knowing my whereabouts!’</p>
<p>For all Repenhardt knew, his master could show up any moment, proclaiming, ‘My disciple! I’ve developed a new training method!’ Repenhardt’s aversion to Gerard had almost reached the level of paranoia, thanks to his rigorous training.</p>
<p>“Still, for just picking things up, that’s quite…”</p>
<p>“Ah, forget it. Why don’t you look after the injured? They need attention more than I do.”</p>
<p>Growing irritated, Repenhardt cut him off and gestured dismissively. The remaining knights were still unconscious, and Sillan was diligently casting healing spells, though they remained out.</p>
<p>“Well then, once again, on behalf of Altion, I thank you for your assistance.”</p>
<p>Without further conversation, Sir Edward placed his hand over his heart as a sign of respect and then stepped back, casting a suspicious glance at Repenhardt.</p>
<p>He had begun to notice that this young traveler was speaking informally to them, knights. Yet, he felt no urge to point it out.</p>
<p>‘It’s too natural.’</p>
<p>The arrogance in his tone was blatant once he opened his mouth. And it seemed he wasn’t even aware of his own haughtiness. Like Stefan, perhaps? It’s a habit formed naturally from commanding others from a higher position.</p>
<p>‘But can a young man really be this arrogant?’</p>
<p>Stefan showed respect to Sir Edward due to his age. But this young man, in his early twenties, spoke rudely even to Edward, who was over forty. To disregard age to such an extent, one had to be either utterly ill-mannered or…</p>
<p>‘Perhaps of royal blood from another country.’</p>
<p>Either way, engaging with him promised to be nothing but tiring. At least it was clear that this young man was strong enough to handle demons they themselves could not, making him an undesirable enemy at the moment. Unlike Stefan, Sir Edward had a good grasp of the situation.</p>
<p>‘But his manner of speaking isn’t so much arrogant as it is…’</p>
<p>Yes, it seemed familiar. It was the tone used when speaking to someone younger.</p>
<p>Sir Edward looked anew at Repenhardt, tearing into his jerky, with a sense of curiosity.</p>
<p>Thanks to Sillan’s diligent healing, the knights gradually regained consciousness, their eyes reddening as they remembered their fallen comrades.</p>
<p>“You’re safe! Thank the gods, Stefan!”</p>
<p>“Curse it! Sir Berto is dead!”</p>
<p>“These damned demons!”</p>
<p>Stefan comforted and encouraged his men.</p>
<p>“Do not grieve. They died as knights should. Ares will remember their bravery, and their souls will be saved. Furthermore, the valor of these knights will be commemorated by the Altion Marquis house. Though they are dead, a knight’s honor lives forever.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere grew solemn at their lord’s comforting words.</p>
<p>“Lord!”</p>
<p>“We understand. Sob, sob!”</p>
<p>The surviving knights gathered to pray to the god Ares and to console the souls of the dead. Todd, coming to his senses belatedly, sighed and immersed himself in meditation to replenish his magic. The chamber was filled with a somber mood.</p>
<p>“Umm…”</p>
<p>Sillan looked around uncertainly. With his healing spells expended, he found himself without a role. Had he been a cleric of Seiya or a priest of Ares, he might have led a service to honor the fallen knights. But as a cleric serving Philanence, the goddess of love, beauty, and compassion, he was at a loss in the face of a warrior’s death.</p>
<p>‘It would be strange to join in their mourning…’</p>
<p>While it felt odd to be unaffected by the deaths, Sillan didn’t feel much sorrow for the knights. His profession had accustomed him to death, and he wasn’t particularly close to the fallen. Had they been followers of Philanence, it might have been different, but knights typically worship Ares.</p>
<p>Sillan had been eyeing Repenhardt with interest, seeking an opportunity to start a conversation. Stealthily, he approached Repenhardt.</p>
<p>“Excuse me, you’re Repen, right?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>
<p>Repenhardt instinctively stepped back as Sillan suddenly approached him with a question. He had been wary of him since the peculiar feeling he got earlier.</p>
<p>‘Why is he suddenly acting friendly?’</p>
<p>Looking up at Repenhardt with eager eyes, Sillan asked,</p>
<p>“How tall are you?”</p>
<p>“About 192cm…”</p>
<p>“And your weight?”</p>
<p>“Well, I haven’t measured it properly, so I’m not sure…”</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe between 110 and 120 kilograms? Lifting things like rocks tends to give one a sense of their own body weight. Despite not appearing overweight, his muscles were densely packed, making him weigh more than he looked.</p>
<p>‘Wow, even though it’s my own body, it’s quite brutish.’</p>
<p>Realizing the numbers made it more tangible. Weighing over 0.1 tons doesn’t seem very human-like, does it? This is almost twice the weight of my previous body.</p>
<p>“What kind of training did you do to build such a physique?”</p>
<p>“I just… got hit a lot, ate a lot, and lifted a lot?”</p>
<p>It was a straightforward and honest answer, but Sillan looked disappointed.</p>
<p>“As expected, warriors don’t readily share their training methods…”</p>
<p>It seemed there was a misunderstanding, but Repenhardt didn’t feel inclined to correct it. He got up, having already rescued the children, it was time to fulfill his purpose for being here.</p>
<p>‘Time to make money, money!’</p>
<p>Only then could he bring his beloved Siris along. With a gleam of avarice in his eyes, Repenhardt stood up, his expression outwardly serious.</p>
<p>“I’ll go scout the exit.”</p>
<p>Most of the knights looked at Repenhardt with admiration. Venturing into the dangerous depths of the dungeon to scout for his comrades! Despite his lowly birth, he seemed to understand the duty of a knight.</p>
<p>Sillan lit up, rising to his feet.</p>
<p>“Then I’ll come with you!”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do if something happens and there are more injured here?”</p>
<p>Sillan deflated at Repenhardt’s indifferent reply and sat down again. But it was a valid point; a healer should stay with the main group, not accompany a scout. Of course, Repenhardt planned to secretly loot the dungeon, so having someone follow him would be inconvenient.</p>
<p>Then, Stefan stood up.</p>
<p>“I’ll go, and Relsia, you stay here and help them.”</p>
<p>“Yes, my lord.”</p>
<p>The elf woman bowed respectfully. Stefan glared at Repenhardt.</p>
<p>“This shouldn’t be a problem, right?”</p>
<p>‘Why does he suddenly want to come along?’</p>
<p>Repenhardt internally sighed. He couldn’t think of an excuse to deter Stefan. Scratching his head, he casually responded and turned away.</p>
<p>“Sure, have it your way.”</p>

                        
                        <div></div>

                        <p>[ Chapter 20 ]</p>
<p>Stefan’s decision to follow Repenhardt was not born out of noble reasons, such as wanting to assist in scouting because it could be dangerous to do so alone, or because, as someone in charge of others, he felt the need to lead by example into perilous situations.</p>
<p>“I can’t admit to having been helped by a barbarian!”</p>
<p>No matter how coincidental it might have been, the fact that he had received help from someone of ignoble blood was undeniable.</p>
<p>If things were to pass without incident, that barbarian would believe he had genuinely offered aid to a knight. This very idea, starting from the presumption to scout alone, proved how little he thought of knights.</p>
<p>Stefan was already irked by how presumptuous humans had become. However, as a knight of principle, dealing with the barbarian’s insolence directly was unbecoming of his station. That’s why he had followed. He intended to save the barbarian from a demon, teaching him his place.</p>
<p>Holding a sword (he had brought a spare sword prepared by Sir Edward), Stefan repeatedly muttered to himself.</p>
<p>“Come on, any demon will do. I’ll dispatch it swiftly.”</p>
<p>Of course, Repenhardt had no idea of Stefan’s thoughts, nor did he care to know. He was simply following his old memories, diligently searching for profitable hidden pathways.</p>
<p>Moving cautiously with a torch through the dark passageway, Repenhardt’s expression suddenly brightened.</p>
<p>“Ah! There it is!”</p>
<p>He spotted a partially collapsed chamber on the left side of the passageway, and from within, monsters were slowly emerging. Stefan lit up, readying his stance for combat.</p>
<p>“Here they come!”</p>
<p>“I’ll show them the splendid swordsmanship of the Altion family!” Stefan was about to leap into action when suddenly…</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>A strong blow to the back of his neck clouded his consciousness.</p>
<p>“What, what’s this?”</p>
<p>“Just sleep for a bit.”</p>
<p>With a simple strike to the neck, Repenhardt had knocked out this troublesome burden. He then swiftly dealt with the attacking monsters. The fight was so trivial it barely warranted description. He simply dispatched them and leapt into the room.</p>
<p>The chamber was half-destroyed, with what appeared to be metal wardrobes, likely used as a storage area in ancient times, placed around. It was significantly larger, perhaps ten times the size of their base camp’s chamber.</p>
<p>He first began to open boxes piled up next to the door. Although many items had deteriorated over the ages, some still shone brightly.</p>
<p>“Good, good. 50 Silver age coins…….”</p>
<p>The Silver Age coins, being of high purity and archaeological value, were traded at five to six times the price of current age coins. After swiftly collecting them, Repenhardt proceeded to open the drawers of a metal table, one by one.</p>
<p>“It should be here somewhere…”</p>
<p>After a moment, his face lit up with excitement.</p>
<p>“Found it! The Infinite Bag.”</p>
<p>Holding a backpack the size of a child’s head, Repenhardt couldn’t help but beam with joy.</p>
<p>Among the artifacts of the Silver Age, the Infinite Bag was particularly valuable. It wasn’t truly infinite, but it contained a spatial distortion that allowed it to hold up to ten times the volume of its physical size. The weight of the contents would also decrease to one-tenth, making this magical item something current era’s magic couldn’t replicate.</p>
<p>In the present age, magic couldn’t touch the domains solely reserved for gods: direct manipulation of time, space, and matter.</p>
<p>Back in the Silver Age, it was common to reverse time, transcend space, and transform matter itself into new forms with incredible magic. But with the current continent’s magic capped at the 9th circle, such feats were impossible. Only Repenhardt, who had reached the pinnacle of the 10th circle in his prime, managed to recreate a semblance of the Infinite Bag after years of research, doubling its volume through partial spatial distortion.</p>
<p>“Heh, wasn’t there another one here?”</p>
<p>Continuing his search, Repenhardt found another backpack. The Infinite Bag, while a remarkable magical device, wasn’t unique enough to be considered an artifact; it was common to find one or two in a decent dungeon. In the Silver Age, they were standard issue for all soldiers.</p>
<p>Repenhardt strapped the Infinite Bag to his waistband and wrapped a cloth he found rolling nearby around his waist to conceal the backpack. It was crucial not to reveal that he was secretly collecting artifacts. The backpack, as small as a child’s head, was well-concealed by his hand, which was larger. Wrapped in cloth, it was indistinguishable, especially since his trousers were already torn from combat, making the cloth-wrapped waist not seem out of place.</p>
<p>After preparing, he resumed his thorough search of the chamber. Knowing exactly where to look, his search was incredibly fast.</p>
<p>“The Heavenly Brazier, the Dagger of Retrieval, the Marsa Fire… hehe, all these valuable items.”</p>
<p>He continued to stash away Silver Age artifacts into the backpack at his waist. Though it seemed only suitable for small trinkets, in reality, it could hold much more than even a sizable backpack, swallowing item after item.</p>
<p>Thus, Repenhardt diligently collected the artifacts. The items in this room alone, if sold, could fetch enough gold to buy several Elf slaves, but…</p>
<p>“I should get something nice for Siris. Something good to eat and pretty to wear. Let’s gather a bit more.”</p>
<p>As he was about to leave the chamber for the next location, Stefan groaned back to consciousness.</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>Repenhardt nonchalantly pointed to the ground, to where the remains of demons, now separated from their flesh and bones, were soaked in their own remains.</p>
<p>“These things hit you on the back of your head. You were knocked out in one blow.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>Stefan groaned. The demons had sneakily attacked him from behind! He could hardly contain his frustration. Once again, he had been helped by a barbarian. His chest boiled with shame.</p>
<p>“Damn, why does everything have to go wrong today?”</p>
<p>Seeing how easily the young traveler had dealt with them, Stefan assumed they were low-level demons, completely disregarding the fact that such a demon had knocked him out with a single blow. He simply blamed his own carelessness. The suspicion that the barbarian might have been the one to knock him out did not even cross his mind.</p>
<p>Repenhardt started to lead the way through the passage, with Stefan grinding his teeth and sporadically saying,</p>
<p>“Th-thanks for the help.”</p>
<p>One must always uphold one’s duties, no matter the situation; that was the chivalry Stefan had learned. After quickly expressing his thanks, Stefan took the lead in the passage. Again, monsters appeared. His eyes ignited with fire. This time, he would defeat them and show the true power of a knight!</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s nothing really…”</p>
<p>Looking back and forth between Stefan charging ahead and the newly appeared demons, Repenhardt scratched his head. It felt awkward to receive thanks for beating him up, especially since…</p>
<p>“I might have to knock him out again.”</p>
<p>Thump!</p>
<p>“Kueek!”</p>
<p>Once again, Stefan was knocked unconscious. Behind the appearing demon was a new chamber, Repenhardt’s next destination. Naturally, he had to block the view and gather the items without interference!</p>
<p>Well, constantly giving him concussions might leave some lasting damage on the spinal nerves…</p>
<p>“He’s a tough one; he’ll probably be fine.”</p>
<p>Thus, Repenhardt thoroughly scoured the second underground floor for valuable items, during which Stefan had to endure being knocked out three more times.</p>
<p>Despite having been knocked out repeatedly, the young knight, living in his own world, thought nothing more than, “Strange, I wasn’t off guard. Why couldn’t I sense anything? Maybe my body has weakened lately. I should take some tonic when I get back.”</p>
<p>Halfway through the second floor, the backpack was full. Even though he had selected only the most valuable items, the Infinite Bag had its limits due to its inherently small size.</p>
<p>In the past, he could carry a large Infinite Bag, capable of holding up to twenty times its size, and collect everything without issue. But now, it was impossible to carry any more without it being noticeable.</p>
<p>“I can always come back later.”</p>
<p>Repenhardt let go of his greed. After all, he had already far exceeded his target amount. Besides, the third floor of this place held memories with Siris. Exploring it again together and reliving those memories could be quite romantic, in its own way.</p>
<p>Thinking such an oddly romantic thought in the middle of a deadly dungeon, Repenhardt turned back.</p>
<p>“It’s about time to head out.”</p>
<p>“It seems we’ve secured the passage. Let’s return.”</p>
<p>“Ye-yeah.”</p>
<p>Stefan, who had done nothing but be knocked out, responded awkwardly.</p>
<p>The sound of cautious footsteps echoed through the dark passage. The knights led the way, followed by Todd, Sillan, Repenhardt, and the orc slaves.</p>
<p>Though Repenhardt had helped, the exploration was ultimately under the banner of the Altion Marquisate. They couldn’t possibly leave the lead to some unknown newcomer.</p>
<p>Repenhardt walked at the rear, alongside Sillan. The girlish boy had been pestering him with friendly queries, annoyingly curious about everything.</p>
<p>“Mr. Repen, are you by any chance royalty from some country?”</p>
<p>“No, just a commoner.”</p>
<p>“Really? But for such…”</p>
<p>“What? Is it strange for a commoner to be skilled?”</p>
<p>Was Sillan another one deeply ingrained with class consciousness? Repenhardt was about to frown when Sillan shook his head.</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. It’s just… your demeanor is so natural.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Being a warrior, it’s natural to have confidence, and I can understand your attitude towards Sir Stefan but…”</p>
<p>To Sillan, Repenhardt’s martial prowess seemed even greater than that of the knight Stefan. It wasn’t uncommon for a highly skilled commoner to show disrespect towards a less capable noble, though it wasn’t exactly common either. It was understandable.</p>
<p>However, it felt awkward even to Sillan when Repenhardt was dismissive even towards Sir Edward. Disrespecting himself as a cleric could be attributed to Repenhardt’s youth, but it didn’t seem right for him to be so informal with the much older Sir Edward, not appearing as the type to disrespect others casually.</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>This became a moment of reflection for Repenhardt, who reconsidered his behavior. At his time of death, he was already in his fifties, which made the middle-aged Sir Edward seem young to him. Reflecting on it, he realized how absurd his behavior must have seemed.</p>
<p>“Right, I’m 22 now.”</p>
<p>He agreed with Sillan’s observation without objection and came up with a quick excuse.</p>
<p>“I’ve lived quite isolated, so I’m not well-versed in formalities. I’ll be more careful from now on.”</p>
<p>Luckily, Sillan didn’t seem to harbor any suspicions.</p>
<p>“Really? Well, that could happen.”</p>
<p>Thus, Stefan and his group cautiously explored the second floor of the Falton ruins, even managing to pick up some artifacts that Repenhardt had “overlooked,” delighting in their newfound wealth. Though Repenhardt felt a twinge of regret, he let it go.</p>
<p>“After all, I’ve taken the core items; these should at least cover the costs of the expedition.”</p>
<p>As they passed the areas Repenhardt had cleared, monsters began to appear again. The knights, now on their guard, calmly dealt with the demons, making their way through. Repenhardt saw no need to intervene; thanks to him, the strongest creatures like Beiters or Tagrels on the second floor had been taken care of, leaving only weaker demons.</p>
<p>Finally, at the end of the passage, they came across a large metal door engraved with symbols, behind which lay the staircase to the surface.</p>
<p>Stefan opened the door with a tense expression, and the other knights peered inside cautiously. Repenhardt, however, was not worried at all, knowing the area was supposed to be empty. But then…</p>
<p>‘What?’</p>
<p>Repenhardt’s eyes widened in surprise as he looked inside.</p>
<p>“Kraaaa!”</p>
<p>At the staircase leading upwards, right in front of them, a giant demon with a goat’s head was roaring, bound in chains of light.</p>
