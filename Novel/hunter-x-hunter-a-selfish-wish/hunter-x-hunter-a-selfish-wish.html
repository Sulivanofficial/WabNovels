          "Eric, are you sure the Infinity Stones are hidden here? It looks like there is nothing here."
On the dry, gray, and dark back side of the moon, Mystique lowered the aircraft and once again expressed doubts about Eric's judgment.
Eric habitually stroked the ring on the ring finger of his left hand. Under the helmet, his cloudy eyes looked calmly at the moon's surface, "Riven, don't be fooled by appearances, observe the essence of things."
Mystique shrugged, "Come on, Eric, it's my job to confuse others. Come on, I don't want to be caught by Charles."
Eric shook his head slightly. With a wave of his hand, the strong magnetic field protection enveloped the two of them and flew off the ground. This is one of his most proud moves. It can not only withstand various attacks and cosmic rays, but also seal the air around them. Trapped in a magnetic field, which allows him to survive briefly in space.
The two opened the hatch and got off the spacecraft. They flew all the way and saw nothing but desolation. This made Mystique once again doubt his judgment. Just as he was about to speak, Eric suddenly stopped and pointed not far away. of a small crater and said: “It’s right there.”
After that, Eric controlled the magnetic field and descended. He raised his palm slightly to the ground. The ground shook slightly, and a hidden hatch appeared on the ground.
Mystique understood, and her body began to deform, turning into a middle-aged man wearing a blue uniform in an instant. The iconic "4" on his chest showed his identity.
"Why does it have to be Reed? Can't it be turned into Charles? I spent a lot of effort trying to get his irises."
"Reed built this base. There are some places that only he can open."
Eric waved his hand gently and controlled the magnetic field to send Mystique to the door.
A red light swept across Mystique, and the hatch slowly opened.
The two walked into the base, the hatch closed, and an electronically synthesized voice came: "Mr. Reed, welcome back."
Mystique glanced at Eric and said, "Have Charles and Stark been here recently?"
"Professor Charles and Mr. Stark's last recorded visit was eleven days ago."
"What about the others?"
"Mr. Strange came once seven days ago, and Mr. Bertram and Namor have not been here since the last meeting."
Doctor Strange, Black Bolt, Aquaman, plus Professor X, Iron Man, Mister Fantastic?
What exactly is this place? Mystique was puzzled. Before coming, Eric only told her that this was the secret base of Charles, Mr. Fantastic Reed and others, without introducing it in too much detail.
Now it seems that this place is definitely not as simple as she imagined. These six people are all the top superheroes in the world, and they belong to different forces. When they gather together, their sphere of influence radiates to almost all superheroes on the earth. , what do they want to do?
"This is the Illuminati!" Eric slowly walked into a hexagonal hall, his deep voice with a hint of ridicule: "A secret organization formed by a few pretentious guys to solve crises that threaten the earth and even the universe. , no one knows the existence of this organization except themselves.”
"Then how did you know?" Mystique asked in confusion.
"That's what I want to ask too!" Behind them, a circle of light suddenly appeared, and Tony Stark walked out in a suit. Behind him were Professor X and Doctor Strange.
Mystique slapped her forehead. It seemed that this plan, like countless previous plans, had failed before it even started. With a look of helplessness on her face, she walked towards Eric with cat steps.
"Oh, my God, Susan must see this video. His husband, Mr. Fantastic, the old-fashioned Frankenstein actually walks on the catwalk!" Stark pointed at the Mystique who looked like Reed and yelled, Steel The video was projected on the armor.
"Yes, that's it!" Stark shouted excitedly. He quickly clicked on the projection a few times, cut out the clip of Mystique walking on the catwalk, played it on a loop, and paired it with a piece of strange music to create a short clip. Ghost videos.
"Stark!" Professor X reminded.
"Oh, okay, don't be so nervous. I just want to lighten the atmosphere. Now, let's get down to business!" Stark put away the projection and pointed his palm cannon at Eric: "Magneto, Eric Lancel. ! How do you know about the Illuminati!"
"Shouldn't we ask why we are here first?" Mystique looked at Professor X in the wheelchair with a complicated expression.
"Infinity stones!" Doctor Strange outlined mysterious magic runes with his hands and looked at Eric warily.
"This is obvious. Anyone with an IQ greater than one can imagine that the only thing here that can attract the famous Magneto is the Infinity Stones." Stark's voice was still so arrogant.
"Charles, long time no see!" Eric ignored the two of them and greeted his old friend with a smile.
"Eric!" Professor What are you planning? Or, what did you discover?”
"Has it been three years? Time flies so fast, just like the breeze at night, it always slips away from your fingers inadvertently." Eric raised his left hand and turned it slowly, as if there was really a breeze blowing. , "Charles, when did we fight against Apocalypse? Fifty years ago? Or sixty years ago?"
"Fifty-six years ago! Eric, it has been fifty-six years, and we are all old." Professor What do you want to do with the Infinity Stones?”
"Fifty-six years!" Eric did not answer Charles, as if he was still stuck in memories, "We defeated Apocalypse together, rebuilt Xavier Academy for Geniuses together, defeated Dark Phoenix together, and drove away the Gramps together. Rito...oh, by the way, we also reversed the future together!"
"Reverse the future!" Charles' eyes suddenly widened, "Impossible! You can't remember!"
"Hey! Wait, what happened to Days of Future Past? Did I miss any big event?" Stark suddenly interrupted, Doctor Strange's face suddenly changed, his hands changed spells, the Eye of Agamotto opened, and green light enveloped him With his eyes, he quickly checked the timeline. Mystique, who was hiding behind, was also very curious, and her eyes wandered back and forth between the two.
"Of course I remember. Not only do I remember Days of Future Past, I also remember the Summit of Nations, the Golden Gate Bridge, and oh, by the way, that kid's name is Jimmy, right?"

Professor That memory has been deleted, and Eric can't possibly know about it!
"Okay, the chat time is over, Raven, it's time to get to work!" Eric put away his reminiscing look and waved his hand, and the wall around him tore open, revealing a small safe.
"Don't move! Magneto, stay away from the box!" Stark's palm cannon is getting brighter and brighter, ready to fire at any time.
"Don't be nervous, Stark! We all know that the Infinity Stones are not here! The news you released is just a cover." Eric waved his hand, paying no attention to Stark's threat. "The Illuminati has collected three Infinity Stones in total. The gems and time gems are in the hands of Doctor Strange, the reality gems are hidden in the core of the sun by you, and the mind gems are exiled to the universe by you and Reed, making infinite random space jumps. I have to say, your ideas are really ingenious. ”
"Wait, Eric! The Infinity Stones are not here? You lied to me!" Mystique returned to her true self, her blue face full of disbelief.
"Stark, don't you want to know what's in here?" Eric did not answer Mystique, but continued to seduce Stark like a demon from hell, "How many times have you been to this base? You Do you know this thing exists? No! You don’t know! Only Reed knows what he is hiding from you?”
"I'm not interested in exploring an old man's secrets!" Stark said no, but lowered his palm cannon slightly.
It has to be said that Eric is very accurate. Stark is a proud genius. He is dissatisfied with Mr. Fantastic, who is smarter than him, but what can he do if he is dissatisfied? Except for mechanical engineering, in other scientific fields, he is almost always beaten by Reed. Reed is an all-around genius!
How could Stark not pay attention to such a person who was more talented than him? How could you not be curious about his secret?
"Eric, what's inside? A weapon to destroy humanity?" Professor X knew his old friend very well.
"Charles, I can guarantee that this thing will only be used for me and no one will be hurt. Moreover, from now on, Magneto will become history." Eric stared closely into Professor X's eyes and spoke word by word.
"What are you going to do?" Professor X frowned deeply.
At this time, Doctor Strange closed the Eye of Agamotto, and his eyes became clear again. Professor X and Stark both looked at him.
"Time has been blocked by a powerful force. I have tried many methods, but I can't see the future." Doctor Strange looked at Professor X strangely and said, "I can't see the past either!"
Professor
"Ruiwen, open it." Professor X thought for a moment and said suddenly.
Mystique shrugged indifferently, turned into Mr. Fantastic again, and entered her fingerprints, irises, and voiceprint into the safe...
"Reed is a genius. This box is made of a special material. I can't sense the existence of a magnetic field at all!" Eric looked at the slowly opened box and praised it.
Others were also curious and gathered around to watch. They saw something like a lighter lying inside, shining with metallic luster and shining brightly.
"That's it? A lighter?" Stark looked at Eric like he was a fool.
"This is not a lighter, this is the ultimate eraser!"
A new book is released, friends who like Marvel come and take a look, you will not be disappointed!




"The Ultimate Eraser? What is that? An eraser?" Stark seemed to lightly knock on the outer shell of the box, but in fact he was scanning this thing through Jarvis.
The results of the scan came out quickly, but he couldn't understand it, once again...
He could only see that this little thing contained an unimaginable amount of energy, and any leakage could blow the earth into cosmic dust!
This thing is very dangerous! Magneto must not get it!
This is the conclusion Stark came to, and it is also the decision of Doctor Strange. He is the holder of the Time Stone and the Supreme Sorcerer favored by the Trinity Vishanti. His vision is much higher than Stark. The Ultimate Eraser, of course he knows, this is one of the best killers in the universe!
"Eric, my feeling tells me that this thing is very dangerous! What on earth are you going to do with it?" Professor X also didn't want him to get this thing. His mental power has been warning him. This feeling is countless times stronger than when facing Apocalypse.
"This is a key. I just want to use it to open a door." Eric replied with a smile, reaching out to grab the Ultimate Eraser.
"You lied!" Doctor Strange took action first. Cytorak's scarlet necklace instantly wrapped around the safe. With a strong pull, the safe broke away from the wall and flew towards Doctor Strange.
"This is not up to you!" Eric waved his hand, and several steel bars broke through the wall and tightly wrapped around the safe, wrestling with Doctor Strange.
Stark also launched an attack, firing two palm cannons at close range. Eric didn't even blink and let him attack. He saw that the palm cannon was blocked by an invisible wall, only causing a little ripple.
"Damn, magnetic shield!" Stark cursed inwardly and flew into the air to look for flaws.
Eric would not let him get his way. With a light wave of his hand, Stark flew out like garbage. "Stark, wearing steel armor to fight Magneto, I really doubt your IQ."
Professor X controlled Mystique at the first time and took her to retreat quickly to a safe place. Facing Eric, who was wearing an anti-mind control helmet, his ability was useless. In order to prevent himself and Mystique from becoming hostages, he had to evacuate as quickly as possible.
Of course, he had a more important role, calling for reinforcements.
Magneto could control electromagnetic fields. Ordinary communication equipment could not work at all in front of Magneto, but he could!
The distance from the moon to the earth was far beyond his ability limit, but he had Mr. Fantastic's black technology, an ultra-long-range single-line telepathic transmitter, a device like a Bluetooth headset, which could connect Illuminati members within the solar system.
Eric didn't care about Professor X's retreat, which was within his expectations. He waved his hand gently, and a metal door rotated like a windmill, cutting off the scarlet necklace of Cytorak that Doctor Strange had wrapped around the safe.
Doctor Strange suddenly conjured up a magic long knife and chopped it on the safe.
Cut it in two with one stroke! Whether it was the safe made of special materials by Mr. Fantastic or the several steel bars wrapped around the box, they were no different from paper-made ones, and were cut into two pieces by Doctor Strange with one stroke.
"The sacred sword of Vishanti? I really don't understand. Why is it called a sword when it's just a knife?" Eric knew Doctor Strange's moves very well. He controlled the remaining steel bars on the safe again, turning them into several spirit snakes, and entangled the Ultimate Eraser in the box. He also couldn't directly control the Ultimate Eraser.
Doctor Strange countered the move and quickly recited the spell. A small ancient body of Hogs was smashed on the safe. The safe and the remaining steel bars on it exploded immediately, turning into a flying butterfly and dissipating, leaving only the Ultimate Eraser falling down.
Eric wanted to control some metal again to take back the Ultimate Eraser, but it was too late. A portal appeared out of thin air under the Ultimate Eraser, and it fell straight down. Looking at the scene opposite the portal, it should be the New York Temple.
"Come back!" Eric stretched out his hand and grabbed it. A metal round shield suddenly flew out of the New York Temple and supported the bottom of the Ultimate Eraser. At the last moment when the portal was closed, the Ultimate Eraser was sent back and was firmly grasped in his hand.
"You pissed me off!" Stark flew back after being thrown out. Under the mask, his face turned blue and he felt greatly insulted.
"Oh? Is this your anti-Magneto armor?" Eric found that Stark had changed into a new armor. The material of the armor seemed to be carbon nanotubes, which was completely immune to his ability.
On the other side, Doctor Strange opened several portals in a row, and Aquaman, Black Bolt, and Mr. Fantastic walked out one after another.
The six giants of the Illuminati gathered!
"Finally, we are all here. So, let's start!" Eric slowly flew off the ground and looked down at everyone.
"You are not the only one who can fly here!" Aquaman held a spear, his face full of pride, and flew up.
Black Bolt put his hands behind his back, his lips tightly closed, and stared at Magneto in the air.
"He has a very strong magnetic field protection around him. Give me a few minutes and I can interfere with him!" Mr. Fantastic held a palm-sized instrument in his hand and kept debugging it. It should be a temporary assembled black technology equipment, and many lines were exposed.
"Illuminati? Haha, you don't know what you are going to face!" Eric smiled contemptuously and snapped his fingers lightly. A strong electromagnetic pulse burst out. Stark's armor was not affected at all, but the semi-finished black technology equipment in Mr. Fantastic's hand was not so lucky. It emitted a few wisps of black smoke and was declared scrapped.
"Oh, no!" Mr. Fantastic was shocked and hurriedly threw the instrument in his hand. Whether intentionally or not, the instrument slid a few meters on the ground and stopped at Eric's feet.
Aquaman had the most violent temper. Seeing Eric take the initiative, he threw the spear in his hand with force and flew towards Eric behind the spear.
Eric controlled a metal door to fly up and blocked the spear. At the same time, several steel bars flew out from the wall and wrapped around Aquaman, making him unable to move.
"A fish in the sea still wants to toss on the ground?" Eric sneered and controlled the steel bars to tighten continuously, binding Aquaman tightly to the ground. If Aquaman did not have superhuman physical fitness, he would have been strangled into several pieces long ago.
"Ah!" Black Bolt suddenly opened his mouth and shouted softly, and the pseudo-sound wave carried this huge energy to impact Eric's magnetic field shield, making the shield shaky.
"Boom!" Before Eric could react, the black technology device that he thought had been scrapped suddenly exploded under his feet. A strange magnetic field wave swept over Eric, and his magnetic field shield was instantly broken. The magnetic field controlled by his heart also lost control instantly. He could no longer fly and fell down.
