        <p>
          Dying is a new feeling of anger for me I was about to go to college for engineering with a scholarship I had it all planned out for college I was going to make some connections there knowing some people getting the best grades and using those people that I made connections with to get a good job and then I will plan to go higher and higher until I touched the sky I had plans to get rich quick I even had a family the family that gave up a lot for me they needed me and I just had to go and die damn it damn it damn it then I feel something weird and look around the void and I turn around and see an eye as gigantic as a mountain I I am not going to lie I am scared I just kept walking backward away from it as fast and as stealthily as I can then as I am doing so I keep looking at The Darkness thing with just an eye and I see a gigantic mouth open I can't even see its end jet rows and rows of sharp teeth a lot of tongues come out of the mouth and towards me this is terrifying as I think this I immediately turn around and run in darkness or whatever I don't even look at what I am stepping in I keep running and running and running I don't know how long I have been running but I see a circle made of light about my size in front of me so I directly jump into it and then I lose consciousness the next time I wake up I see a bright light in front of my face and hear someone or something say it's a boy M Miller I suddenly feel someone grabbing me my baby my baby boy ah I get it now after I hear that I immediately start crying as I have assessed the situation I hear someone with a hard manly voice say my son my son are you okay honey then the voice I hear the womanly voice from before talking in an ushered tone answer yes just stop screaming you are making the baby cry just like this 6 months pass after being here for such a Time life is really boring I was born in do Harbor in 1969 I don't know where I am but I am in the past Sue that means a lot of money making opportunities waiting for me I am about to overuse my future knowledge as much as I can by the way my name is Jax Miller and my parents names are Jerry Miller 41 years old black hair and eyes and good looking man that works in a loan bank Beth Miller 28 years old brown hair and brown eyes with a pretty face yeah I know quite the age difference there and there is me I seem like I am going to be good-looking with black hair and brown eyes with a baby face I don't know to me babies just look almost all the same finally I reached the age of one-year-old and okay okay Red Alert I just heard father say something bizarre he was talking to me about hunters at first I didn't think anything special but he said that when he was younger he wanted to be a hunter or whatever I was only half listening but when I asked about specifically why he wanted to be a hunter when he earns more money and easier as a lone man I asked him in gibberish baby talk obviously but then he started explaining Hunter adventures and stories types of them like Blacklist Hunters Gourmet Hunters Etc I almost went full panic mode but I pushed it at the back of my mind and forced myself to calm down then as soon as night time came I went into bed and I started practicing meditation well then an extreme change of plans must come about I must meditate to start my training now I am in the world of Hunter x Hunter then as I reached 2 years old I already started preparing for the future the main thing I need is access to N I keep meditating but I still haven't awakened it yet I am kind of disappointed that I don't have the kind of talent the MC's do but I still keep trying not giving up after all I have patience because I am born way before the main characters I now started to run around do Harbor to get to know things around but mainly for me to exercise my body of course I don't go into Shady easy to get kidnapped alleys and areas I always run during daylight and when there is at least a dozen people around finally as I am at the age of three I have had some success in nen yes I did it I got my nen I feel the warm mucus feeling around me then I am even able to naturally close my nodes from leaking any Aura until I can cover myself in it and not let any go away as another year passes I notice something strange it seems like I have nowhere near the talent of Gan and kilowa I still need to keep training my 10 are the hard work I have to put through just because I don't have the talent well then anyway I now have control over 10 and I still keep training my body I now even go and help the people around carrying their stuff and keep acting like a kid I am thinking after getting a bit stronger I will run away from home and go train somewhere I won't really miss my new parents I was never really connect with them after all I did possess their baby I mean if I didn't do so then how was I able to use nen with my average soul from my past life and if they knew they would definitely not react nicely but I don't blame them for it either and I'm even a little grateful to them for creating my new body even so the only people I will ever truly love are my family in my last world but at least they are safe in that one I also learned how to read and started convincing my father to buy me medical books I gave him a reason because I want to become a doctor to save people he reluctantly did so at the age of five I am finally able to train other basic nin techniques I have now started training zetsu to suppress my aura to hide from other nin users I still train my body now that I am ready to find out my category of nen I didn't try it sooner because it would have been useless to me with my talent it would have only got me distracted I am in my room and ready to do so I put down a glass of water with a leaf on top and I then run some in through it that is when chapter 2 The Leaf started rotating a little ah I see so I am a manipulator well that is quite good it's not that bad of an N category because every one of them has their uniqueness and strengths ulator what can I do with that whom I have a basic idea on my hatsu but it would take my lifespan to get it completed because of my lack of Talent OR AA size anyway instead of wasting my lifespan I will just try to train to my maximum capacity and that will be when I create my hatsu special ability it wouldn't take much of my lifespan or none at all I will wait until I am 20 then I will create my hatsu I will have plenty of power and then amount by then I hope plus with 10 slowing down aging but not slowing down growth I think I will be okay then but I really don't want to waste lifespan on this ability after all I am not like a selfless shown and character that will sacrifice things like this but the time until I create my ability will help me think of some more things to add to it or maybe put some conditions on it to make it easier to create and stronger as I grow at the age of six I notice that my body is getting stronger I have started going to the wild to train after I learned Reen to enhance my physical ability well not really the wild just the forests outside the city I am still studying the basics of nen I have also started studying some simple medical books after all I am going to become a doctor in this world and then take the hunter exam I have some big plans after my hunter exam as another year flows by I still am just training the basic n techniques and my body I am going to school now I usually just train zetsu in school and other techniques at other times at least this time school is easy I also made a lot of friends that do things for me mostly a smart student I make him do my homework after all I already know these things that we are learning so it's just a waste of time I keep studying medicines and training my body in the wild after all there are a lot of ways to be strong in this world even without nen there exist people like a snake charmer or even someone who knows assassination techniques n doesn't necessarily diminish this uniqueness it actually makes it even more complicated also I have been reading some animal books to learn about some animals in this world then that gave me an idea I have started killing some wild animals without my parents knowing and selling them in the harbor to buyers of course I was disguised in a cloak I earned a lot of money like this about 100 Jenny which is around 100 of course this was not won by just selling animals earnestly it was by selling RAR looking animals which were not rare to stupid buyers and always coming only once a month at different intervals to sell people fake animals and come the other times in another disguise to sell normal animals that I catch in a day at the age of eight I have stopped selling fake animals because someone might come after me so this year I won only 40 Jenny I have also spent 10 00 buying four medical books I needed I have also been telling my mother that I have been sleeping in one of my friend's houses and having a sleepover when in
