      <h2>Capítulo 1: -</h2>
      <p>
        Dying is a new feeling of anger for me I was about to go to college for
        engineering with a scholarship I had it all planned out for college I
        was going to make some connections there knowing some people getting the
        best grades and using those people that I made connections with to get a
        good job and then I will plan to go higher and higher until I touched
        the sky I had plans to get rich quick I even had a family the family
        that gave up a lot for me they needed me and I just had to go and die
        damn it damn it damn it then I feel something weird and look around the
        void and I turn around and see an eye as gigantic as a mountain I I am
        not going to lie I am scared I just kept walking backward away from it
        as fast and as stealthily as I can then as I am doing so I keep looking
        at The Darkness thing with just an eye and I see a gigantic mouth open I
        can't even see its end jet rows and rows of sharp teeth a lot of tongues
        come out of the mouth and towards me this is terrifying as I think this
        I immediately turn around and run in darkness or whatever I don't even
        look at what I am stepping in I keep running and running and running I
        don't know how long I have been running but I see a circle made of light
        about my size in front of me so I directly jump into it and then I lose
        consciousness the next time I wake up I see a bright light in front of
        my face and hear someone or something say it's a boy M Miller I suddenly
        feel someone grabbing me my baby my baby boy ah I get it now after I
        hear that I immediately start crying as I have assessed the situation I
        hear someone with a hard manly voice say my son my son are you okay
        honey then the voice I hear the womanly voice from before talking in an
        ushered tone answer yes just stop screaming you are making the baby cry
        just like this 6 months pass after being here for such a Time life is
        really boring I was born in do Harbor in 1969 I don't know where I am
        but I am in the past Sue that means a lot of money making opportunities
        waiting for me I am about to overuse my future knowledge as much as I
        can by the way my name is Jax Miller and my parents names are Jerry
        Miller 41 years old black hair and eyes and good looking man that works
        in a loan bank Beth Miller 28 years old brown hair and brown eyes with a
        pretty face yeah I know quite the age difference there and there is me I
        seem like I am going to be good-looking with black hair and brown eyes
        with a baby face I don't know to me babies just look almost all the same
        finally I reached the age of one-year-old and okay okay Red Alert I just
        heard father say something bizarre he was talking to me about hunters at
        first I didn't think anything special but he said that when he was
        younger he wanted to be a hunter or whatever I was only half listening
        but when I asked about specifically why he wanted to be a hunter when he
        earns more money and easier as a lone man I asked him in gibberish baby
        talk obviously but then he started explaining Hunter adventures and
        stories types of them like Blacklist Hunters Gourmet Hunters Etc I
        almost went full panic mode but I pushed it at the back of my mind and
        forced myself to calm down then as soon as night time came I went into
        bed and I started practicing meditation well then an extreme change of
        plans must come about I must meditate to start my training now I am in
        the world of Hunter x Hunter then as I reached 2 years old I already
        started preparing for the future the main thing I need is access to N I
        keep meditating but I still haven't awakened it yet I am kind of
        disappointed that I don't have the kind of talent the MC's do but I
        still keep trying not giving up after all I have patience because I am
        born way before the main characters I now started to run around do
        Harbor to get to know things around but mainly for me to exercise my
        body of course I don't go into Shady easy to get kidnapped alleys and
        areas I always run during daylight and when there is at least a dozen
        people around finally as I am at the age of three I have had some
        success in nen yes I did it I got my nen I feel the warm mucus feeling
        around me then I am even able to naturally close my nodes from leaking
        any Aura until I can cover myself in it and not let any go away as
        another year passes I notice something strange it seems like I have
        nowhere near the talent of Gan and kilowa I still need to keep training
        my 10 are the hard work I have to put through just because I don't have
        the talent well then anyway I now have control over 10 and I still keep
        training my body I now even go and help the people around carrying their
        stuff and keep acting like a kid I am thinking after getting a bit
        stronger I will run away from home and go train somewhere I won't really
        miss my new parents I was never really connect with them after all I did
        possess their baby I mean if I didn't do so then how was I able to use
        nen with my average soul from my past life and if they knew they would
        definitely not react nicely but I don't blame them for it either and I'm
        even a little grateful to them for creating my new body even so the only
        people I will ever truly love are my family in my last world but at
        least they are safe in that one I also learned how to read and started
        convincing my father to buy me medical books I gave him a reason because
        I want to become a doctor to save people he reluctantly did so at the
        age of five I am finally able to train other basic nin techniques I have
        now started training zetsu to suppress my aura to hide from other nin
        users I still train my body now that I am ready to find out my category
        of nen I didn't try it sooner because it would have been useless to me
        with my talent it would have only got me distracted I am in my room and
        ready to do so I put down a glass of water with a leaf on top and I then
        run some in through it that is when chapter 2 The Leaf started rotating
        a little ah I see so I am a manipulator well that is quite good it's not
        that bad of an N category because every one of them has their uniqueness
        and strengths ulator what can I do with that whom I have a basic idea on
        my hatsu but it would take my lifespan to get it completed because of my
        lack of Talent OR AA size anyway instead of wasting my lifespan I will
        just try to train to my maximum capacity and that will be when I create
        my hatsu special ability it wouldn't take much of my lifespan or none at
        all I will wait until I am 20 then I will create my hatsu I will have
        plenty of power and then amount by then I hope plus with 10 slowing down
        aging but not slowing down growth I think I will be okay then but I
        really don't want to waste lifespan on this ability after all I am not
        like a selfless shown and character that will sacrifice things like this
        but the time until I create my ability will help me think of some more
        things to add to it or maybe put some conditions on it to make it easier
        to create and stronger as I grow at the age of six I notice that my body
        is getting stronger I have started going to the wild to train after I
        learned Reen to enhance my physical ability well not really the wild
        just the forests outside the city I am still studying the basics of nen
        I have also started studying some simple medical books after all I am
        going to become a doctor in this world and then take the hunter exam I
        have some big plans after my hunter exam as another year flows by I
        still am just training the basic n techniques and my body I am going to
        school now I usually just train zetsu in school and other techniques at
        other times at least this time school is easy I also made a lot of
        friends that do things for me mostly a smart student I make him do my
        homework after all I already know these things that we are learning so
        it's just a waste of time I keep studying medicines and training my body
        in the wild after all there are a lot of ways to be strong in this world
        even without nen there exist people like a snake charmer or even someone
        who knows assassination techniques n doesn't necessarily diminish this
        uniqueness it actually makes it even more complicated also I have been
        reading some animal books to learn about some animals in this world then
        that gave me an idea I have started killing some wild animals without my
        parents knowing and selling them in the harbor to buyers of course I was
        disguised in a cloak I earned a lot of money like this about 100 Jenny
        which is around 100 of course this was not won by just selling animals
        earnestly it was by selling RAR looking animals which were not rare to
        stupid buyers and always coming only once a month at different intervals
        to sell people fake animals and come the other times in another disguise
        to sell normal animals that I catch in a day at the age of eight I have
        stopped selling fake animals because someone might come after me so this
        year I won only 40 Jenny I have also spent 10 00 buying four medical
        books I needed I have also been telling my mother that I have been
        sleeping in one of my friend's houses and having a sleepover when in
        reality I am sleeping in the forest with a rope on a branch tied to a
        rock on one side and in the other is me holding it with my hand while
        sleeping this is an exercise from the anime so I am trying to learn it
        well I learned that pretty fast so I didn't have to tell my parents new
        excuses why I am not sleeping at home I skipped some grades also when I
        told my parents school is too easy boring and not a challenge and I want
        to skip it I have been training my body a lot my strength especially by
        Rolling a lot of rocks that are up to my knee I would try for more but I
        really don't want to hurt my young body yet I even started learning gyo
        which is putting men towards my eyes to see n better and see things
        hidden with i in it was quite hard learning and keeping my in
        concentrated on my eyes but hey at least I can now use it I still keep
        training the basics a damn it why don't I have talent like Gan or kilua
        I would have already been strong if I had that by the way I need to
        think of a way to make more money now that I have gyo there could be a
        way to earn money age 9 years old I still keep practicing the basic n
        abilities and goo which I can now use sparingly M my talent is sht it's
        not even funny at how average it is if I was born in the same generation
        as the MC's I would just go to a quiet place far from the conflict and
        stay in isolation until I get my n mastered which by then I wouldn't
        even know what happened I now keep pushing Boulders as big as my
        childish body I keep going towards the market to find anything good but
        all I find is trash nothing with nen in it I even quit hunting it's just
        a waste of time for way to little amount of money at the age of 10 my
        body has gotten more robust and muscular even when I am so young now
        they I am doing pull-ups with rope tied to my feet with a small Boulder
        tied on the other side I do push-ups with Boulders half as big as me on
        my back I still train the basics and go a lot you know this is getting
        kind of annoying when I remember how the MC got it so easily gyo is
        getting better I am now able to keep it up kind of stable for about 1
        minute did I already complain today about my super average talent I keep
        studying medicine and I skipped a bunch of grades and went directly to
        high school people around town know me as a helpful and genius young man
        and my parents are really proud of me I don't really care about any of
        that I just want to train my Men chapter 3 as I become 15 years old I
        noticed that I have gotten quite stronger since last time normal people
        can no longer be compared to me I have trained my body quite harshly my
        n amount is now larger than before I haven't seen any Hunters around to
        compare it to in the next years to come I am going to keep a lookout for
        them I am now in University studying medicine away from my hometown I am
        known quite a bit in this field and am known by some important people
        even though I keep training men I have started to feel the limit of my
        talent it's getting harder and harder to get stronger I would need years
        and years to progress even a bit I look at my hands and I make them into
        a fist I just need to wait five more years to get everything in order
        for me to make my hatsu I have everything about my ability figured out
        but I need to be a little stronger to not use lifespan and have less
        conditions on it just like this 3 years pass and I am 18 years old now I
        still study in this University after all medical knowledge has become
        more of a side project I have been studying and trying to figure the
        best method on how to train my body as I was currently reading on the
        library after I finished some body training I was tired so I decided to
        rest here and read while doing so I then hear a professor that teaches
        about diseases and viruses talking with someone else and walking towards
        me I then give a side glance towards him and then my eyes widen
        immediately he is not even in my radar anymore what I am concentrated on
        is the person next to him she is a bespectacled woman of average height
        with seafoam green hair haircut at medium length she wears a headdress
        that has a pair of doglike ears a conservative knee length white dress
        and a white caplet with a cross at the front of the neck her upper jaw
        and nose also look like those of a dog she is a younger Cheeto yure the
        woman who will become the future chairman of the hunter Association then
        as they are walking towards me the teacher points at me and says in a
        proud voice he is our brightest student his name is Jax Miller he has
        been here since he was 15 he is truly amazing he is smart and a hard
        worker then they are in front of my table I look towards them then the
        teacher Smiles towards me and says Jax this is a disease Hunter and a
        famous one at that her name is cheel Yorkshire I look at her with a
        neutral face trying to keep my thoughts unreadable also it wouldn't be
        smart to lie or act in front of her because she will definitely be able
        to tell even though she is younger now she was able to tell when one of
        the most scheming people in Hunter x Hunter is not telling the truth she
        just looks at me she smiles a little and she says hey there my name is
        Cheeto Yorkshire have you ever thought of taking the hunter exam I can
        see that you are special I just look towards her and am about to say
        something but I am interrupted by the teacher who in a panicked voice
        says no no Miss Yorkshire Jax is a good student and is going to likely
        be a miraculous doctor but I have heard that the hunter exam is
        physically taxing and I don't think that he is ready or suited for it
        she just looks at him and says in a mysterious tone I think that he is
        stronger than you give him credit for professor she is right I still
        keep training myself extensively every day then she completely ignores
        my professor as she keeps staring at me intensely that is when I decide
        to say to her in a normal voice sa yes I have thought about it but I am
        not ready yet I am first thinking of finishing medical school getting
        some medical experience then I will become a hunter she just looks at me
        turns around and starts walking away while but not before she says okay
        then I will be waiting for you to become a hunter notify me when you do
        become one I could teach you more about your uniqueness I can
        immediately guess what she is thinking she probably thought I was an N
        genius they are those that use nen unconsciously she probably didn't
        take me as her student and teach me nin immediately because she probably
        wants to follow the rules to keep nin hidden she probably also thinks
        that nen might distract me from my medical studies and she thought that
        she might be able to entice me to take the hunter exam earlier for me to
        learn about my uniqueness I already know about men and no way am I
        learning from someone who can tell when I am lying or not I need to
        disappear for a little then I will apply for graduation immediately I
        don't want her following me even 2 years later at the age of 20 I still
        think about my meeting with her but that isn't so important anymore I
        look at the trees around me and I can't help but reminisce a little
        after that meeting with cheel I graduated that year and went to the
        heavens Arena I got until the 199th floor got the money I won and left
        immediately I won 20000 Jenny I also did some procedures to raise my
        poison and electricity immunity it was very painful and harsh but I know
        I will need it my resistance is still not at zoric Family level but if
        they had a 10 resistance I have around seven I also know that the guide
        for this year's Hunter exam is in zaban city which is close to D Harbor
        I also now have a way to compare my strength now that I have seen some
        fights from the 200th floor I would have competed to become floor master
        and I might have been able to become one with some luck and by crushing
        some beginners in the 200th floor but if I met any strong Freaks Like
        Hoka I would be crippled or dead now that I am back in my hometown to
        make M inability I think back on my struggles if I trained another 10 to
        15 years I would be a lot stronger than this and I might reach my
        absolute limit by then but I don't have time like that in 10 years Canon
        will start and the only Advanced men technique I know is gyo because I
        am just going to be wasting time if I try to learn the others with my
        talent I can hold Reen active for one hour Gan and kilua could do it for
        3 hours with only a minuscule amount of training compared to me Not only
        would it be hard and time consuming knowing those abilities won't even
        help me create my hatsu ability then I go into the forest and use my
        aren a gentle white Rippling Aura comes out I then put my hand forward
        facing the sky and think about my ability and say to myself myen expend
        yourself and give the ability chapter 4 flash minin concentrates in my
        hand as if it is all being sucked into it like there is a whirlpool on
        the palm of my hand slowly Min enformed into a square type and a normal
        looking tablet appears on my hand I immediately stop my Reen and go to
        10 which stops my aura from leaking away I keep this always active to
        slow down my aging I look at the reflective screen okay the tablet
        contrary to my real age I have a face that looks like a 16-year-old but
        I am taller than the average one I'm 185 M 61 with black hair and brown
        eyes with a good-look face and a pair of glasses I don't really need the
        glasses but it puts my opponents off guard sometimes and they think I
        don't have a strong body I mean it's not that big of an advantage but I
        will get whatever I can I think of my hatsu that was thankfully created
        hatsu gamer Body Soul control an ability to grow physical stats then
        amount and then Talent with exp from killing living organisms the
        stronger the organism the more exsp I get physical abilities do not
        degrade from not training condition one the organisms must have their n
        open or be at least as strong as the average Hunter physically to get
        exp from them two can't take exp from an organism that is killed by
        someone else three after you kill them you must touch their body with
        your right hand while having the tablet in the other hand then the body
        will become Sparkles of light and enter the tablet to become exp four
        after I upgrade my nen amount or talent in my status page I can't use
        nen for one day five phys physical training gives exp directly to the
        stat that is being trained until it gets to the next level it won't get
        a rise in power no matter even if the stat is 1 exp away from leveling
        up X LVL 44950 exp it will still be the same power as being only Z exp
        in that level X LVL 450 exp that is my hatsu finally haahaha I
        immediately have to force myself to calm down and look at my tablet
        there is only one app in it called status and I click on it and I see my
        attributes Jax Miller age 20 Talent 50100 exp exp zero St LVL 5 4,100
        exp AG LVL 52100 exp n LVL 5 9,100 exp n Mount LVL 542 ,100 exp the
        status represent with LVL of certain stats stats are ranked like this
        LVL power one normal baby two normal teen three normal adult four
        trained human five normal men user Hunter six strong men user strong
        Hunter seven Phantom troop n user eight cwlo zoric level nine Royal
        Guard level 10 King level marum that is just a general way of ranking
        stats aren't everything for example just because a phantom troop member
        has stats lower or higher than level seven doesn't matter what is used
        to calculate this is that they have one Stat or maybe two stats at level
        seven and the others one number lower or even two numbers if they have a
        rare hatsu for example yuin probably has seven strength seven endurance
        and six agility while feton has six strength six endurance and he has
        seven agility but of course battles aren't dependent completely on stats
        I think feton would defeat yagin in battle because of his special
        ability which is the more he is hurt the more heat produces his Rising
        Sun ability well anyways the most important part of my ability is the
        ability to raise Talent also if I raise talent I will become more
        talented not in Just In N but in other things like cooking driving Etc
        obviously normal people have talent in some things and no talent in
        other things but my talent is universal of course no matter how talented
        you are you need some foundational knowledge on the subject mine is at
        five which is average I have made the level 10 of talent be like gon's
        Talent of nen I believe moram had more than 10 in Talent especially with
        his devour type special nen ability also no manipulators will be able to
        control me because for manipulators it's the early bird gets the worm
        though technically I am already controlled by my own ability so it won't
        work I am also planning on taking the hunter exam this year I kept
        looking around the forest to make sure no one came here when I was doing
        my hatsu special ability creation after making sure I immediately take
        out my phone and call someone crying then a voice which I can't even
        tell the gender of comes through the line who are you when I hear this I
        just calmly answer hey Zed I need some info then the voice comes back
        more clearly this time and it is easily identified as a man and he says
        sure man what do you need I just ask him in a calm voice when and where
        is the hunter exam I hear him ruffle through something and then say sure
        man just he then starts explaining the info and giving me all the
        details that I need to know even some
